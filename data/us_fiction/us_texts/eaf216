LETTERS
OF
JONATHAN OLDSTYLE,
Gent.
LETTER I.
Sir
,
Nothing
is more intolerable to an old
person than innovation on old habits. The
customs
that prevailed in our youth become dear to
us as we advance in years; and we can no more
bear to see them abolished, than we can to behold
the trees cut down under which we have sported
in the happy days of infancy.
Even I myself, who have floated down the
stream of life with the tidewho have
humoured
it in all its turningswho have conformed in a
great measure to all its fashions,cannot but feel
sensible of this prejudice. I often sigh when I draw
a comparison between the present and the past;
and though I cannot but be sensible that, in
general
,
times are altered for the better, yet there is
something even in the
imperfections
of the
manners
which prevailed in my youthful days, that is
inexpressibly endearing.
There is nothing that seems more strange and
preposterous to me, than the manner in which
modern marriages are conducted. The parties
keep the matter as secret as if there was
something
disgraceful in the connexion. The lady
positively denies that any thing of the kind is to
happen; will laugh at her intended husband, and
even lay bets against the event, the very day
before
it is to take place. They sneak into
matrimony
as quietly as possible, and seem to pride
themselves on the cunning and ingenuity they have
displayed in their manuvres.
How different is this from the manners of
former
times! I recollect when my
Aunt Barbara
was addressed by '
Squire Stylish;
nothing was
heard of during the whole courtship, but
consultations
and negotiations between her friends and
relatives; the matter was considered and
re-considered
,
and at length the time set for a final
answer
.
Never, Mr. Editor, shall I forget the awful
solemnity of the scene. The whole family of the
Oldstyles assembled in awful conclave: my aunt
Barbara dressed out as fine as hands could make
herhigh cushion, enormous cap, long waist,
prodigious
hoop, ruffles that reached to the end of her
fingers, and a gown of flame-coloured brocade,
figured with poppies, roses, and sun-flowers.
Never did she look so sublimely handsome. The
'Squire entered the room with a countenance suited
to the solemnity of the occasion. He was arrayed
in a full suit of scarlet velvet, his coat decorated
with a profusion of large silk buttons, and the skirts
stiffened with a yard or two of buckram; a long
pig-tailed wig, well powdered, adorned his head;
and stockings of deep blue silk, rolled over the
knees, graced his extremities; the flaps of his vest
reached to his knee-buckles, and the ends of his
cravat, tied with the most precise neatness, twisted
through every button hole. Thus accoutred, he
gravely walked into the room, with his ivory
headed ebony cane in one hand, and gently
swaying
his three-cornered beaver with the other. The
gallant and fashionable appearance of the 'Squire,
the gracefulness and dignity of his deportment,
occasioned a general smile of complacency through
the room; my aunt Barbara modestly veiled her
countenance with her fan; but I observed her
contemplating
her admirer with great satisfaction
through the sticks.
The business was opened with the most formal
solemnity, but was not long in agitation. The
Oldstyles were moderatetheir articles of
capitulation
few: the 'Squire was gallant, and acceded
to them all. In short, the blushing Barbara was
delivered up to his embraces with due ceremony.
Then, Mr. Editorthen were the happy times:
such oceans of arracksuch mountains of plum
cakesuch feasting and congratulatingsuch
fiddling
and dancing:ah me! who can think of those
days, and not sigh when he sees the degeneracy
of the present: no eating of cake nor throwing of
stockingsnot a single skin filled with wine on the
joyful occasionnor a single pocket edified by it
but the parson's.
It is with the greatest pain I see those customs
dying away, which served to awaken the
hospitality
and friendship of my ancient comradesthat
strewed with flowers the path to the altar, and shed
a ray of sunshine on the commencement of the
matrimonial union.
The deportment of my aunt Barbara and her
husband was as decorous after marriage as before;
her
conduct was always regulated by
his
her
sentiments ever accorded with his opinions; she
was always eager to tie on his neckcloth of a
morning
to
tuck a napkin under his chin at meal times
to wrap him up warm of a winter's day, and to
spruce him up as smart as possible of a Sunday.
The 'Squire was the most attentive and polite
husband
in the world; would hand his wife in and out
of church with the greatest ceremonydrink her
health at dinner with particular emphasis, and ask
her advice on every subjectthough I must
confess
he invariably adopted his own;nothing was
heard from both sides, but dears, sweet loves,
doves, &c. The 'Squire could never stir out of a
winter's day, without his wife calling after him from
the window to button up his waistcoat carefully.
Thus, all things went on smoothly; and my
relations
Stylish
had the name, and, as far as I know,
deserved it, of being the most happy and loving
couple in the world.
A modern married pair will, no doubt, laugh at
all this; they are accustomed to treat one another
with the utmost carlessness and neglect. No
longer
does the wife tuck the napkin under her
husband's
chinnor the husband attend to heaping
her plate with dainties;no longer do I see those
little amusing fooleries in company, where the lady
would pat her husband's cheek, and he chuck her
under the chin; when dears and sweets were as
plenty as cookies on a new-year's day. The wife
now considers herself as totally independentwill
advance her own opinions, without hesitation,
though directly opposite to hiswill carry on
accounts
of her own, and will even have secrets of
her own, with which she refuses to intrust him.
Who can read these facts, and not lament with
me the degeneracy of the present times;what
husband is there but will look back with regret to
the happy days of female subjection.
JONATHAN OLDSTYLE.
LETTER II.
Sir
,
There
is no place of public amusement of
which I am so fond as the Theatre. To enjoy this
with the greater relish, I go but seldom; and I find
there is no play, however poor or ridiculous, from
which I cannot derive some entertainment.
I was very much taken with a play bill of last
week, announcing, in large capitals,
The Battle
of Hexham, or, Days of Old
. Here, said I to
myself, will be something grand
Days of old
my
fancy fired at the words. I pictured to myself all
the gallantry of chivalry. Here, thought I, will
be a display of court manners, and true politeness;
the play will, no doubt, be garnished with tilts
and tournaments; and as to those
banditti
, whose
names make such a formidable appearance on
the bills, they will be hung up, every mother's
son, for the edification of the gallery.
With such impressions, I took my seat in the
pit, and was so impatient that I could hardly
attend
to the music, though I found it very good.
The curtain roseout walked the Queen with
great majesty; she answered my ideasshe was
dressed well, she looked well, and she acted well.
The Queen was followed by a pretty gentleman,
who, from his winking and grinning, I took to
be the court fool; I soon found out my mistake.
He was a courtier
high in trust
, and either
general, colonel, or something of
martial
dignity.
They talked for some time, though I could not
understand
the drift of their discourse, so I amused
myself with eating pea-nuts.
In one of the scenes I was diverted with the
stupidity of a corporal and his men, who sung a
dull song, and talked a great deal about nothing;
though I found by their laughing, there was a
great deal of fun in the corporal's remarks.
What this scene had to do with the rest of the
piece, I could not comprehend; I suspect it was
a part of some other play, thrust in here
by
accident
.
I was then introduced to a cavern, where there
were several hard looking fellows, sitting around
a table carousing. They told the audience they
were banditti. They then sung a
gallery song
,
of which I could understand nothing but two lines:
The Welshman lik'd to have been chok'd by a mouse,
But he pull'd him out by the tail.
Just as they had ended this elegant song, their
3
banquet was disturbed by the
melodious sound
of
a horn, and in marched a
portly gentleman
, who, I
found, was their captain. After this worthy
gentleman
had fumed his hour out, after he had
slapped
his breast and drawn his sword half a dozen
times, the act ended.
In the course of the play, I learnt that there
had been, or was, or would be, a battle; but how,
or when, or where, I could not understand. The
banditti once more made their appearance, and
frightened the wife of the portly gentleman, who
was dressed in man's clothes, and was seeking
her husband. I could not enough admire the
dignity
of her deportment, the sweetness of her
countenance
,
and the unaffected gracefulness of her
action; but who the captain really was, or why he
ran away from his spouse, I could not understand.
However, they seemed very glad to find one another
again; and so at last the play ended, by the falling
of the curtain.
I wish the manager would use a
drop scene
at
the close of the acts; we might then always
ascertain
the termination of the piece by the
green
curtain
.
On this occasion, I was indebted to the
polite
bows of the actors for this pleasing
information
.
I cannot say that I was entirely satisfied
with the play, but I promised myself ample
entertainment
in the after-piece, which was called the
Tripolitan Prize
. Now, thought I, we shall have
some
sport
for our money; we will, no doubt, see
a few of those Tripolitan scoundrels spitted like
turkeys, for our amusement. Well, sir, the
curtain
rosethe trees waved in front of the stage,
and the sea rolled in the rearall things looked
very pleasant and smiling. Presently I heard a
bustling behind the sceneshere, thought I, comes
a band of fierce Tripolitans, with whiskers as long
as my arm. No such thingthey were only a
party
of village masters and misses, taking a walk for
exercise, and very pretty behaved young gentry
they were, I assure you; but it was cruel in the
manager to dress them in
buckram
, as it deprived
them entirely of the use of their limbs. They
arranged
themselves very orderly on each side of
the stage, and sung something, doubtless very
affecting
,
for they all looked pitiful enough. By
and by came up a most tremendous storm; the
lightning flashed, the thunder roared, and the rain
fell in torrents: however, our pretty rustics stood
gaping quietly at one another, until they must have
been wet to the skin. I was surprised at their
torpidity
,
till I found they were each one afraid to
move first, for fear of being laughed at for their
awkwardness. How they got off I do not
recollect
:
but I advise the manager, in a similar
case, to furnish every one with a
trap-door
, through
which to make his exit. Yet this would deprive
the audience of much amusement; for nothing
can be more laughable than to see a body of
guards with their spears, or courtiers with their
long robes,
get
across the stage at our theatre.
Scene passed after scene. In vain I strained
my eyes to catch a glimpse of a Mahometan phiz.
I once heard a great bellowing behind the scenes,
and expected to see a strapping Mussulman come
bouncing in; but was miserably disappointed, on
distinguishing his voice, to find out by his
swearing
that he was only a
Christian
. In he came
an American navy officer. Worsted stockings
olive velvet small clothesscarlet vest
pea-jacket
,
and
gold laced hat
dressed quite
in
character
.
I soon found out, by his talk, that he was
an American prize master; that, returning through
the
Mediterranean
with his Tripolitan prize, he
was driven by a storm on the
coast of England
.
The honest gentleman seemed, from his actions,
to be rather intoxicated; which I could account
for in no other way than his having drank a great
deal of salt water, as he swam ashore.
Several following scenes were taken up with
hallooing and huzzaing, between the captain, his
crew, and the gallery, with several amusing tricks
of the captain and his son, a very funny,
mischievous
little fellow. Then came the cream of
the joke: the captain wanted to put to sea, and
the young fellow, who had fallen desperately in
love, to stay ashore. Here was a contest between
love and honoursuch piping of eyes, such
blowing
of noses, such slapping of pocket holes! But
old Junk
was inflexibleWhat! an American tar
desert his duty! (three cheers from the gallery,)
impossible! American tars for ever!! True blue
will never stain!! &c. &c. (a continual
thundering
among the gods.) Here was a scene of
distress
here
was bathos. The author seemed as
much puzzled to know how to dispose of the
young tar, as old Junk was. It would not do to
leave an American seaman on foreign ground, nor
would it do to separate him from his mistress.
Scene the last opened.It seems that another
Tripolitan cruiser had bore down on the prize,
as she lay about a mile off shore. How a
Barbary
corsair had got in this part of the world
whether she had been driven there by the same
storm, or whether she was cruising to pick up a
few English first rates, I could not learn.
However
,
here she was. Again were we conducted
to the sea shore, where we found all the village
gentry, in their buckram suits, ready assembled
to be entertained with the rare show of an
American
and Tripolitan engaged yard-arm and
yard-arm
.
The battle was conducted with proper
decency
and decorum, and the Tripolitan very
politely
gave inas it would be indecent to conquer
in the face of an American audience.
After the engagement the crew came ashore,
joined with the captain and gallery in a few
more huzzas, and the curtain fell. How old Junk,
his son, and his son's sweetheart, settled it, I could
not discover.
I was somewhat puzzled to understand the
meaning and necessity of this engagement
between
the ships, till an honest old countryman at
my elbow said, he supposed
this
was
the Battle
of Hexham
, as he recollected no fighting in the
first piece. With this explanation I was
perfectly
satisfied.
My remarks upon the audience, I shall
postpone
to another opportunity.
JONATHAN OLDSTYLE.
LETTER III.
Sir
,
My
last communication mentioned my visit to
the theatre; the remarks it contained were chiefly
confined to the play and the actors; I shall now
extend them to the audience, who, I assure you,
furnish no inconsiderable part of the
entertainment
.
As I entered the house some time before the
curtain rose, I had sufficient leisure to make some
observations. I was much amused with the
waggery
and humour of the gallery, which, by the way,
is kept in
excellent
order by the constables who are
stationed there. The noise in this part of the house
is somewhat similar to that which prevailed in
Noah's ark; for we have an imitation of the whistles
and yells of every kind of animal. This, in some
measure, compensates for the want of music, as
the gentlemen of our orchestra are very economic
of their favours. Somehow or another, the anger
of the gods seemed to be aroused all of a sudden,
and they commenced a discharge of apples, nuts,
and gingerbread, on the heads of the honest folks
in the pit, who had no possibility of retreating from
this new kind of thunderbolts. I can't say but I
was a little irritated at being saluted aside of my
head with a rotten pippin; and was going to shake
my cane at them, but was prevented by a decent
looking man behind me, who informed me that it
was useless to threaten or expostulate. They are
only
amusing themselves
a little at our expense,
said he; sit down quietly and bend your back to it.
My kind neighbour was interrupted by a hard green
apple that hit him between the shouldershe made
a wry face, but knowing it was all a joke, bore the
blow like a philosopher. I soon saw the wisdom
of this determination; a stray thunderbolt
happened
to light on the head of a little sharp faced
Frenchman, dressed in a white coat and small
cocked hat, who sat two or three benches ahead
of me, and seemed to be an irritable little animal.
Monsieur was terribly exasperated; he jumped
upon his seat, shook his fist at the gallery, and
swore violently in bad English. This was all nuts
to his merry persecutors; their attention was wholly
turned on him, and he formed their
target
for the
rest of the evening.
I found the ladies in the boxes, as usual,
studious
to please; their charms were set off to the
greatest advantage; each box was a little battery
in itself, and they all seemed eager to outdo each
other in the havoc they spread around. An arch
glance in one box was rivalled by a smile in
another, that smile by a simper in a third, and in
a fourth a most bewitching languish carried all
before
it.
I was surprised to see some persons
reconnoitring
the company through spy-glasses; and was
in doubt whether these machines were used to
remedy deficiencies of vision, or whether this was
another of the eccentricities of fashion. Jack
Stylish has since informed me, that glasses were
lately all
the go;
though hang it, says Jack, it is
quite
out
at present; we used to mount our glasses
in
great snuff
, but since so many
tough jockies
have followed the lead, the bucks have all
cut
the
custom. I give you, Mr. Editor, the account in
my dashing cousin's own language. It is from a
vocabulary I do not well understand.
I was considerably amused by the queries of
the countryman mentioned in my last, who was
now making his first visit to the theatre. He kept
constantly applying to me for information, and I
readily communicated, as far as my own ignorance
would permit.
As this honest man was casting his eye round
the house, his attention was suddenly arrested.
And pray, who are these? said he, pointing to a
4
cluster of young fellows. These, I suppose, are
the critics, of whom I have heard so much. They
have, no doubt, got together to communicate their
remarks, and compare notes; these are the
persons
through whom the audience exercise their
judgments, and by whom they are told when they
are to applaud or to hiss. Critics! ha! ha! my
dear sir, they trouble themselves as little about the
elements of criticism, as they do about other
departments of science and belles-lettres. These
are the beaux of the present day, who meet here
to lounge away an idle hour, and play off their
little impertinencies for the entertainment of the
public. They no more regard the merits of the
play, nor of the actors, than my cane. They
even
strive
to appear inattentive; and I have seen
one of them perched on the front of the box with
his back to the stage, sucking the head of his
stick, and staring vacantly at the audience,
insensible
to the most interesting specimens of
scenic representation, though the tear of sensibility
was trembling in every eye around him. I have
heard that some have even gone so far in search
of amusement, as to propose a game of cards in
the theatre, during the performance. The eyes of
my neighbour sparkled at this informationhis
cane shook in his handthe word
puppies
burst
from his lips. Nay, says I, I don't give this for
absolute fact: my cousin Jack was, I believe,
quizzing
me (as he terms it) when he gave me the
information. But you seem quite indignant, said
I, to the decent looking man in my rear. It was
from him the exclamation came; the honest
countryman
was gazing in gaping wonder on
some new attraction. Believe me, said I, if you
had them daily before your eyes, you would get
quite used to them. Used to them, replied he;
how is it possible for people of sense to relish
such conduct? Bless you, my friend, people of
sense have nothing to do with it; they merely
endure
it in silence. These young gentlemen live
in an indulgent age. When I was a young man,
such tricks and follies were held in proper
contempt
.
Here I went a little too far; for, upon
better recollection, I must own that a lapse of
years has produced but little alteration in this
department
of folly and impertinence. But do the
ladies admire these manners! Truly, I am not as
conversant in female circles as formerly; but I
should think it a poor compliment to my fair
countrywomen
,
to suppose them pleased with the
stupid
stare and cant phrases with which these
votaries
of fashion add affected to real ignorance.
Our conversation was here interrupted by the
ringing of a bell. Now for the play, said my
companion
.
No, said I, it is only for the musicians.
These worthy gentlemen then came crawling
out of their holes, and began, with very solemn
and important phizzes, strumming and tuning
their instruments in the usual style of
discordance
,
to the great
entertainment
of the audience.
What tune is that? asked my neighbour,
covering
his ears. This, said I, is no tune; it is only
a pleasing
symphony
, with which we are regaled,
as a preparative. For my part, though I admire
the effect of contrast, I think they might as well
play it in their cavern under the stage. The bell
rung a second timeand then began the tune in
reality; but I could not help observing, that the
countryman was more diverted with the queer
grimaces and contortions of countenance
exhibited
by the musicians, than their melody. What I
heard of the music, I liked very well; (though I
was told by one of my neighbours, that the same
pieces have been played every night for these
three years;) but it was often overpowered by the
gentry in the gallery, who vociferated loudly for
Moll in the Wad, Tally ho the Grinders
, and
several other
airs
more suited to their tastes.
I observed that every part of the house has its
different department. The good folks of the
gallery
have all the trouble of ordering the music;
(their directions, however, are not more frequently
followed than they deserve.) The mode by which
they issue their mandates is stamping, hissing,
roaring, whistling; and, when the musicians are
refractory, groaning in cadence. They also have
the privilege of demanding a
bow
from
John
, (by
which name they designate every servant at the
theatre, who enters to move a table or snuff a
candle;) and of detecting those cunning dogs
who peep from behind the curtain.
By the by, my honest friend was much puzzled
about the curtain itself. He wanted to know why
that
carpet
was hung up in the theatre? I assured
him it was no carpet, but a very fine curtain. And
what, pray, may be the meaning of that gold head,
with the nose cut off, that I see in front of it? The
meaningwhy, really, I can't tell exactlythough
my cousin, Jack Stylish, says there is a great deal
of meaning in it. But surely you like the
design
of the curtain? The design,why really I can
see no design about it, unless it is to be brought
down about our ears by the weight of those gold
heads, and that heavy
cornice
with which it is
garnished. I began now to be uneasy for the
credit of our curtain, and was afraid he would
perceive the mistake of the painter, in putting a
harp
in the middle of the curtain, and calling it a
mirror;
but his attention was
happily
called
away by the
candle-grease
from the chandelier,
over the centre of the pit, dropping on his clothes.
This he loudly complained of, and declared his
coat was
bran-new
. How, my friend? said I; we
must put up with a few trifling inconveniences,
when in the pursuit of pleasure. True, said he;
but I think I pay pretty dear for it;first to give
six shillings at the door, and then to have my head
battered with rotten apples, and my coat spoiled
by candle-grease; by and by I shall have my
other clothes dirtied by sitting down, as I perceive
every body mounted on the benches. I wonder
if they could not see as well if they were all to
stand upon the floor.
Here I could no longer defend our customs, for
I could scarcely breathe while thus surrounded
by a host of strapping fellows, standing with their
dirty boots on the seats of the benches. The
little
Frenchman, who thus found a temporary
shelter
from the missive compliments of his gallery
friend, was the only person benefitted. At last
the bell again rung, and the cry of
down, down
hats off
, was the signal for the commencement of
the play.
If, Mr. Editor, the garrulity of an old fellow is
not tiresome, and you choose to give this
view of
a New-York Theatre
a place in your paper, you
may, perhaps, hear further from your friend,
JONATHAN OLDSTYLE.
LETTER IV.
Sir
,
I shall
now conclude my remarks on the
Theatre, which I am afraid you will think are
spun out to an unreasonable length; for this I can
give no other excuse, than that it is the privilege
of old folks to be tiresome, and so I shall proceed.
I had chosen a seat in the pit, as least subject
to annoyance from a habit of talking loud that has
lately crept into our theatres, and which
particularly
prevails in the boxes. In old times, people
went to the theatre for the sake of the play and
acting; but I now find that it begins to answer
the purpose of a coffee-house, or fashionable
lounge, where many indulge in loud conversation,
without any regard to the pain it inflicts on their
more attentive neighbours. As this conversation
is generally of the most trifling kind, it seldom
repays the latter for the inconvenience they suffer,
of not hearing one half of the play. I found,
however
,
that I had not much bettered my situation;
but that every part of the house has its share of
evils. Besides those I had already suffered, I
was yet to undergo a new kind of torment. I had
got in the neighbourhood of a very obliging
personage
,
who had seen the play before, and was
kindly anticipating every scene, and informing
those that were about him what was to take place;
to prevent, I suppose, any
disagreeable
surprise
to which they would otherwise have been liable.
Had there been any thing of a plot to the play,
this might have been a serious inconvenience; but
as the piece was entirely
innocent
of every thing
of the kind, it was not of so much importance. As
I generally contrive to extract amusement from
every thing that happens, I now entertained
myself
with remarks on the self-important air with
which he delivered his information, and the
distressed
and impatient looks of his unwilling
auditors
.
I also observed that he made several
mistakes in the course of his communications.
Now you'll see, said he, the queen in all her
glory, surrounded with her courtiers, fine as
fiddles
,
and ranged on each side of the stage like
rows of pewter dishes. On the contrary, we were
presented with the portly gentleman and his
ragged
regiment
of banditti. Another time he
promised
us a regale from the fool; but we were
presented with a
very fine speech
from the queen's
grinning counsellor
.
My country neighbour was exceedingly
delighted
5
with the performance, though he did not half
the time understand what was going forward. He
sat staring, with open mouth, at the portly
gentleman
,
as he strode across the stage, and in furious
rage drew his sword on the
white lion
. By
George, but that's a brave fellow, said he, when
the act was over; that's what you call first rate
acting, I suppose.
Yes, said I, it is what the critics of the present
day admire, but it is not altogether what I like;
you should have seen an actor of the
old school
do this part; he would have given it to some
purpose
;
you would have had such ranting and
roaring
,
and stamping and storming; to be sure, this
honest man gives us a
bounce
now and then in
the true old style, but in the main he seems to
prefer walking on plain ground, to strutting on the
stilts
used by the tragic heroes of my day.
This is the chief of what passed between me
and my companion during the play and
entertainment
,
except an observation of his, that it would
be well if the manager was to drill his nobility and
gentry now and then, to enable them to go through
their evolutions with more grace and spirit. This
put me in mind of something my cousin Jack said
to the same purpose, though he went too far in
his zeal for reformation. He declared, he
wished
sincerely one of the critics of the day would
take all the
slab-shabs
of the theatre, (like
cats in
a bag
,) and
twig
the whole bunch. I can't say
but I like Jack's idea well enough, though it is
rather a severe one.
He might have remarked another fault that
prevails
among our performers, (though I don't know
whether it occurred this evening,) of dressing
for the same piece in the fashions of different
ages and countries, so that while one actor is
strutting about the stage in the cuirass and helmet
of Alexander, another, dressed up in a gold-laced
coat and bag wig, with a chapeau de bras under
his arm, is taking snuff in the fashion of one or
two centuries back, and perhaps a third figures
in Suwarrow boots, in the true style of modern
buckism.
But what, pray, has become of the noble Marquis
of Montague, and Earl of Warwick? (said the
countryman
,
after the entertainment was concluded.)
Their names make a great appearance on the bill,
but I do not recollect having seen them in the course
of the evening. Very trueI had quite forgot
those worthy personages; but I suspect they have
been behind the scenes, smoking a pipe with our
other friends
incog.
the Tripolitans. We must
not be particular now-a-days, my friend. When
we are presented with a battle of Hexham
without
fighting
, and a Tripolitan afterpiece without
even a
Mahometan whisker
, we need not be
surprised
at having an
invisible
marquis or two thrown
into the bargain.But what is your opinion of
the house? said I; don't you think it a very
substantial
,
solid-looking
building, both inside and
out? Observe what a fine effect the dark
colouring
of the wall has upon the white faces of the
audience, which glare like the stars in a dark night.
And then, what can be more pretty than the
paintings in the front of the boxes, those little
masters and misses sucking their thumbs, and
making mouths at the audience?
Very fine, upon my word. And what, pray,
is the use of that chandelier, as you call it, that is
hung up among the clouds, and has showered down
its favours upon my coat?
Oh, that is to illumine the heavens, and set off
to advantage the little perriwig'd cupids, tumbling
head over heels, with which the painter has
decorated
the
dome
. You see we have no need of the
chandelier below, as here the house is
perfectly
well
illuminated; but I think it would have been a
great saving of candle-light, if the manager had
ordered the painter, among his other pretty designs,
to paint a moon up there, or if he was to hang up
that sun with whose
intense light
our eyes were
greatly annoyed in the beginning of the
afterpiece
.
But don't you think, after all, there is rather
asort of akind of a
heavyishness
about the
house? don't you think it has a little of an
undergroundish
appearance?
To this I could make no answer. I must
confess
I have often thought myself the house had a
dungeon-like
look; so I proposed to him to make
our exit, as the candles were putting out, and we
should be left in the dark Accordingly, groping
our way through the dismal
subterraneous
passage
that leads from the pit, and passing through the
ragged bridewell-looking ante-chamber, we once
more emerged into the purer air of the park, when
bidding my honest countryman good night, I
repaired
home, considerably pleased with the
amusements
of the evening.
Thus, Mr. Editor, have I given you an account
of the chief incidents that occurred in my visit to
the Theatre. I have shown you a few of its
accommodations
and its imperfections. Those who
visit it more frequently, may be able to give you a
better statement.
I shall conclude with a few words of advice
for the benefit of every department of it. I would
recommend
To the actorsless etiquette, less fustian, less
buckram.
To the orchestranew music, and more of it.
To the pitpatience, clean benches, and
umbrellas
.
To the boxesless affectation, less noise, less
coxcombs.
To the galleryless grog, and better
constables
;and,
To the whole house, inside and out, a total
reformation
.
And so much for the Theatre.

LETTER V.
Sir
,
As
I was sitting quietly by my fireside the
other morning, nursing my wounded shin, and
reading to my cousin, Jack Stylish, a chapter or
two from Chesterfield's Letters, I received the
following epistle from my friend Andrew Quoz;
who, hearing that I talked of paying the actors a
visit, and shaking my cane over their heads, has
written the following letter, part of which is
strongly
in their defence.
To
Jonathan Oldstyle
,
Gent.
MY DEAR FRIEND,
I perceive by the late papers, you have been
entertaining the town with remarks on the
Theatre
.
As you do not seem from your writings to be
much of an adept in the Thespian arcana, permit
me to give you a few hints for your information.
The Theatre, you observe, begins to answer all
the purposes of a coffee-house. Here you are right;
it is the polite lounge, where the idle and curious
resort, to pick up the news of the fashionable
world, to meet their acquaintances, and to show
themselves off to advantage. As to the dull souls
who go for the sake of the play, why, if their
attention is interrupted by the conversation of their
neighbours, they must bear it with patience; it is a
custom authorized by fashion. Persons who go
for the purpose of chatting with their friends are
not to be deprived of their amusement;
they have
paid their dollar
, and have a right to entertain
themselves as well as they can. As to those who
are annoyed by their talking, why they need not
listen to it;
let them mind their own business
.
You are surprised at so many persons using
opera glasses, and wish to know whether they were
all near-sighted. Your cousin, Jack Stylish, has
not explained that matter sufficiently, for though
many
mount
glasses because it is
the go
, yet I am
told that several do it to enable them to distinguish
the countenances of their friends across our scantily
illuminated Theatre. I was considerably amused
the other evening with an honest tar, who had
stationed himself in front of the gallery, and with
an air of affected foppishness, was reconnoitring
the house through a pocket telescope. I could
not but like his notion, for really the gods are so
elevated among the clouds, that unless they are
unusually strong of vision, I can't tell how they
manage to discern with the naked eye what is
passing in the little painted world below them.
I think you complain of the deficiency of the
music; and say that we want a greater variety, and
more of it. But you must know that, though this
might have been a grievance in old times, when
people attended to the musicians, it is a thing of
but little moment at present; our orchestra is kept
principally for form sake. There is such a
continual
noise and bustle between the acts, that it is
difficult to hear a note; and if the musicians were
to get up a new piece of the finest melody, so
nicely tuned are the ears of their auditors, that I
doubt whether nine hearers out of ten would not
complain on leaving the house, that they had been
bored to death with the same old pieces they have
heard two or three years back. Indeed, many
who go to the theatre carry their own music with
them; and we are so often delighted with the
crying
of children by way of glee, and such coughing
and sneezing from various parts of the house by
way of chorus, not to mention the regale of a sweet
symphony from a sweep or two in the gallery, and
occasionally a full piece, in which nasal, vocal,
whistling and thumping
powers are admirably
exerted and blended, that what want we of an
orchestra?
6
In your remarks on the actors, my dear friend,
let me beg of you to be cautious. I would not for
the world that you should
degenerate
into a critic.
The critics, my dear Jonathan, are the very pests
of society; they rob the actor of his reputation
the public of their amusement; they open the
eyes of their readers to a full perception of the
faults of our performers, they reduce our feelings
to a state of miserable refinement, and destroy
entirely
all the enjoyments in which our coarser
sensations
delighted. I can remember the time when
I could hardly keep my seat through laughing at
the wretched buffoonery, the merry-andrew tricks,
and the unnatural grimaces played off by one of
our theatric Jack Puddings; when I was struck
with awful admiration at the roaring and ranting of
a buskined hero, and hung with rapture on every
word, while he was tearing a passion to tatters
to very rags! I remember the time when he
who could make the queerest mouth, roll his eyes,
and twist his body with the most hideous
distortions
,
was surest to please. Alas! how changed
the times, or rather how changed the taste; I can
now sit with the gravest countenance, and look
without a smile on all such
mimicry;
their
skipping
,
their squinting, their shrugging, their
snuffling
,
delight not me; and as to their ranting and
roaring,
I'd rather hear a brazen candlestick turned,
Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree,
than any such fustian efforts to attain a shallow
gallery applause.
Now, though I confess these critics have
reformed
the manners of the actors, as well as the
tastes of the andience, so that these absurdities are
almost banished from the New-York stage, yet do
I think they have employed a most unwarrantable
liberty.
A critic, my dear sir, has no more right to expose
the faults of an actor, than he has to detect the
deceptions of a juggler, or the impositions of a
quack. All trades must live; and as long as the
public are satisfied to admire the tricks of the
juggler
,
to swallow the drugs of the quack, or to
applaud
the fustian of the actor, whoever attempts to
undeceive them, does but curtail the pleasures of
the latter, and deprive the former of their bread.
Ods-bud! hath not an actor eyes, and shall he not
wink?
hath not an actor teeth, and shall he not
grin?feet, and shall he not stamp?lungs,
and shall he not roar?breast, and shall he not
slap it?hair, and shall he not
club
it? Is he not
fed with plaudits from the gods? delighted with
thumpings from the groundlings? annoyed by hisses
from the boxes?
If you censure his follies, does he not complain?
If you take away his bread, will he not starve? If
you starve him, will he not die? And if you kill
him, will not his wife and seven small infants, six
at her back and one at her breast, rise up and cry
vengeance against you? Ponder these things
seriously
,
my friend Oldstyle, and you will agree with
me that, as the actor is the most meritorious and
faultless, so is the critic the most cruel and
sanguinary
character in the worldas I will show you
more fully in my next.
Your loving friend,
ANDREW QUOZ.
From the tenor and conclusion of these remarks
of my friend, Mr. Andrew Quoz, they may not
improperly
be called the Rights of Actors; his
arguments are, I confess, very forcible, but, as they
are entirely
new
to me, I shall not hastily make up
my mind. In the mean time, as my leg is much
better, I believe I shall hobble to the Theatre on
Monday evening, borrow a seat in a side box, and
observe how the actors conduct themselves.
JONATHAN OLDSTYLE.
LETTER VI.
Sir
,
I mentioned in my last my intention of
visiting
the Theatre on Monday night. I
accordingly
reached there, with the assistance of Jack
Stylish, who procured for me in one of the boxes
an uncomfortable and dirty seat, which, however,
I found as good as any of my neighbours. In the
pit I was determined never again to venture. The
little Frenchman, mentioned in my former
remarks
,
had adopted the same resolution; for, on
casting my eyes around the Theatre, I recognised
his sharp phiz, and pinched up cocked hat, peering
over the ledge of the Shakspeare. The poor little
fellow had not changed his place for the better;
a brawny Irishman was leaning with his arms
a-kimbo on his shoulders, and coolly surveying the
audience, unmindful of the writhings and
expostulations
of the irritated little Gaul, whose chin
was pressed hard upon the front of the box, and
his small black eyes twinkling with fury and
suffocation
.
How he disengaged himself I do not
know, for my attention was just then called away
by a different object; and on turning around some
time afterwards, Monsieur had disappeared.
I found every thing wore its old appearance.
The same
silence, order
, and
regularity
prevailed,
as on my former visit. The central chandelier hung
unmolested in the heavens, setting off to advantage
the picture of Mr. Anybody, with which it is
adorned
,
and shedding a melancholy ray into that den
in which (if we may judge from the sounds that
issue thence) so many troubled spirits are confined.
I had marched into the Theatre through rows
of tables heaped up with delicacies of every kind
here, a pyramid of apples, or oranges, invited
the playful palate of the dainty; while there, a
regiment of mince pies and custards, promised a
more substantial regale to the hungry. I entered
the box, and looked around with astonishment
not a grinder but had its employment. The
crackling
of nuts, and the craunching of apples, saluted
my ears on every side. Surely, thought I, never
was an employment followed up with more
assiduity
,
than that of gormandizing; already it
pervades
every public place of amusement; nay, it
even begins to steal into our churches, where
many a mouthful is munched in private; and few
have any more objection to eat than laugh
in their
sleeves
.
The eating mania prevails through every class
of society; not a soul but has caught the infection.
Eating clubs are established in every street and
alley, and it is impossible to turn a corner without
hearing the hissing of frying pans, winding the
savoury steams of roast and boiled, or seeing some
hungry genius bolting raw oysters in the middle
of the street. I expect we shall shortly carry our
knives and forks, like the Chinese do their chop
sticks, in our pockets.
I was interrupted in my meditations by Jack
Stylish, who proposed that we might take a peep
into the
lounging-room
, the dashing appearance
of which Jack described in high terms; I willingly
agreed to his proposal.
The room perfectly answered my expectations,
and was a piece with the rest of the Theatre: the
high finish of the walls, the windows fancifully
decorated with red baize and painted canvass, and
the
sumptuous
wooden benches placed around it,
had a most inviting appearance.
I drew the end of one of them near to an
elegant
stove that stood in the centre of the room,
and seating myself on it, stretched my lame leg
over a chair; placing my hands on the head of
my cane, and resting my chin upon them, I began
to amuse myself by reconnoitring the company,
and snuffing up the delightful perfume of French
brandy, Holland gin, and Spanish segars.
I found myself in a circle of young gentry, who
appeared to have something in agitation, by their
winking and nodding; at the same time I heard
a confused whispering around me, and could
distinguish
the words, smoke his wigtwig his silver
bucklesold quizcanecock'd hatqueer phiz
and a variety of others, by which I soon found
I was in bad quarters. Jack Stylish seemed
equally uneasy with myself, for though he is fond
of fun himself, yet I believe the young dog has
too much love for his old relation, to make him
the object of his mirth. To get me away, he told
me my friend Quoz was at the lower end of the
room, and seemed, by his looks, anxious to speak
with me; we accordingly joined him, and finding
that the curtain was about rising, we adjourned to
the box together.
In our way, I exclaimed against the indecorous
manner of the young men of the present day; the
impertinent remarks on the company in which
they continually indulge; and the cant phrases
with which their shallow conversation is
continually
interlarded. Jack observed, that I had popp'd
among a set of
hard boys;
yes, master Stylish,
said I, turning round to him abruptly, and I
observed
by your winks and grins, that you are
better
acquainted with them than I could wish. Let
me tell you, honest friend, if ever I catch you
indulging
in such despicable fopperies, and
hankering
after the company of these disrespectful
youngsters, I will discard you from my affections
entirely. By this time we had reached our box,
so I left my cousin Jack to digest what I had just
said; and I hope it may have weight with him;
though I fear, from the thoughtless gayety of his
disposition, and his knowledge of the strong hold
he has in my foolish old heart, my menaces will
make but little impression.
We found the play already commenced. I was
particularly delighted with the appearance and
manners of one of the female performers. What
ease, what grace, what elegance of deportment
this is not acting, cousin Jack, said Ithis is
reality.
After the play, this lady again came forward,
and delivered a ludicrous epilogue. I was
extremely
sorry to find her step so far out of that
graceful line of character, in which she is
calculated
to shine; and I perceived, by the
countenances
around me, that the sentiment was
universal
.
Ah! said I, how much she forgets what is due
7
to her dignity. That charming countenance was
never made to be so unworthily distorted; nor
that graceful person and carriage to represent the
awkward movements of hobbling decrepitude.
Take this word of advice, fair lady, from an old
man, and a
friend:
Never, if you wish to retain
that character of elegance you so deservedly
possess
never
degrade yourself by assuming the
part of a mimic.
The curtain rose for the afterpiece. Out
skipped
a
jolly Merry Andrew
. Aha! said I, here is
the
Jack-pudding
. I see he has forgot his
broomstick and gridiron; he'll compensate for
these wants, I suppose, by his wit and humour.
But where is his master, the Quack? He'll be
here presently, said Jack Stylish; he's a queer old
codger; his name's Puffaway; here's to be a rare
roasting match, and this quizzical looking fellow
turns the spit. The Merry Andrew now began
to deal out his speeches with great rapidity; but,
on a sudden, pulling off a black hood that covered
his face, who should I recognise but my old
acquaintance
,
the
portly gentleman
.
I started back with astonishment.
Sic transit
gloria mundi!
exclaimed I, with a melancholy
shake of the head. Here is a
dreary
, but true
picture, of the vicissitudes of lifeone night
paraded
in regal robes, surrounded with a
splendid
train
of nobility; the next, degraded to a poor
Jack-pudding
, and without even a
gridiron
to
help himself. What think you of this, my friend
Quoz? said I; think you an actor has any right
to sport with the
feelings
of his audience, by
presenting
them with such
distressing
contrasts.
Honest Quoz, who is of the melting mood, shook
his head ruefully, and said nothing. I, however,
saw the tear of
sympathy
tremble in his eye, and
honoured him for his
sensibility
.
The
Merry Andrew
went on with his part, and
my pity increased as he progressed; when, all of
a sudden, he exclaimed, And as to
Oldstyle
, I
wish him to old Nick. My blood mounted into
my cheeks at this insolent mention of my name.
And what think you of
this
, friend Quoz?
exclaimed
I, vehemently; I presume this is one of
your rights of actors. I suppose we are now to
have the stage a vehicle for lampoons and
slanders
;
on which our fellow citizens are to be
caricatured
by the clumsy hand of every dauber who
can hold a brush! Let me tell you, Mr. Andrew
Quoz, I have known the time when such insolence
would have been hooted from the stage.
After some persuasion, I resumed my seat, and
attempted to listen patiently to the rest of the
afterpiece; but I was so disgusted with the Merry
Andrew, that in spite of all his skipping, and
jumping, and turning on his heel, I could not yield
him a smile.
Among the other original characters of the
dramatis person, we were presented with an
ancient maiden; and entertained with jests and
remarks from the buffoon and his associates,
containing
equal
wit
and
novelty
. But jesting apart,
I think these attempts to injure female happiness,
at once cruel and unmanly. I have ever been an
enthusiast in my attachment to the fair sexI
have ever thought them possessed of the strongest
claims to our admiration, our tenderness, and our
protection. But when to these are added still
stronger claimswhen we see them aged and
infirm
,
solitary and neglected, without a partner to
support them down the descent of lifecold
indeed
must be that heart, and unmanly that spirit,
that can point the shafts of ridicule at their
defenceless
bosomsthat can poison the few drops
of comfort heaven has poured into their cup.
The form of my sister Dorothy presented itself
to my imagination; her hair silvered by time, but
her face unwrinkled by sorrow or care. She hath
borne her faculties so meekly, that age has
marked
no traces on her forehead. Amiable sister of
my heart! cried I, who hast jogged with me
through so many years of existence, is this to be
the recompense of all thy virtues; art thou, who
never, in thought or deed, injured the feelings of
another, to have thy own massacred, by the jarring
insults of those to whom thou shouldst look for
honour and protection?
Away with such despicable trumperysuch
shallow, worn-out attempts to obtain applause from
the unfeeling. I'll no more of it; come along,
friend Quoz; if we stay much longer, I suppose
we shall find our courts of justice insulted, and
attempts to ridicule the characters of private
persons
!
Jack Stylish entreated me to stay, and see
the addition the manager had made to his live
stock, of an ass, a goose, and a monkey. Not I,
said I, I'll see no more. I accordingly hobbled
off with my friend, Mr. Andrew Quoz. Jack
declared
he would stay behind and see the end of
the joke. On our way home, I asked friend Quoz,
how he could justify such clumsy attempts at
personal
satire. He seemed, however, rather
reserved
in his answers, and informed me, he would
write his sentiments on the subject.
The next morning, Jack Stylish related to me
the conclusion of the piece. How several actors
went into a wheel one after another, and after a
little grinding, were converted into asses, geese,
and monkeys, except the
Merry Andrew
, who was
found such a
tough jockey
, that the wheel could
not digest him, so he came out as much a
Jack-pudding
as ever.
JONATHAN OLDSTYLE.
LETTER VII.
Sir
,
I had just put on my spectacles, and mended
my pen, to give you an account of a visit I made
some time since, with friend Quoz and my sister
Dorothy, to a ball, when I was interrupted by the
following letter from the former.
My friend Quoz, who is what the world calls a
knowing man
, is extremely fond of giving his
opinion in every affair. He displays in this
epistle
more than usual knowledge of his subject, and
seems to exert all his argumentative talents to
enforce
the importance of his advice. I give you
his letter without further comment, and shall
postpone my description of the ball to another
opportunity.
To
Jonathan Oldstyle
,
Gent
.
MY DEAR FRIEND,
I once more address you on a subject that I
fear will be found irksome, and may chafe
that testy disposition (forgive my freedom) with
which you are afflicted. Exert, however, the good
humour of which, at bottom, I know you to have a
plentiful stock, and hear me patiently through. It
is the anxious fear I entertain of your sinking into
the gloomy abyss of criticism, on the brink of
which you are at present tottering, that urges me
to write.
I would set before you the rights and wrongs of
an
actor;
and by painting in strong colours the
peculiarity of his situation, call your good sense
into action.
The world, my friend Oldstyle, has ever been
prone to consider the theatrical profession in a
degraded point of view. What first gave rise to
this opinion, I am at loss to conceive; but I
consider it as the relic of one of those ancient
prejudices, which the good sense of the world is
daily discarding; and I flatter myself it will in a
little time be totally exploded. Why the actor
should be considered inferior in point of
respectability
to the poet, the painter, or any other person
who exerts his talents in delineating character, or
in exhibiting the various operations of the human
mind, I cannot imagine. I know you, friend
Oldstyle
,
to be a man of too liberal sentiments not to
be superior to these little prejudices; and also
one who regards an actor, provided his private
character be good, with equal respect as the
member
of any other profession. Yet you are not
quite aware of the important privileges solely
attached to the dramatic performer. These I
will endeavour to point out.
The works of a poet or painter you may freely
criticisenay, they offer them for that purpose
they listen attentively to your observations, and
profit by your censures. But beware how you
exercise such conduct towards an actor; he needs
no instructionhis own
impartial
judgment is
sufficient to detect and amend all his
imperfections
.
Attempt to correct his errors, and you
ruin him at oncehe'll
starve
to spite you; he is
like a decayed substance, that crumbles at the
touch.
No, Sirwhen an actor is on the stage, he is in
his own houseit is his castlehe then has you
in his powerhe may there
bore
you with his
buffoonery, or insult you with his pointed remarks,
with perfect impunity. You, my friend, who are
rather apt to be dissatisfied, may call it hard
treatment
,
to be thus annoyed, and yet compensate the
annoyer for his trouble. You may say, that as
you pay an equivalent for your amusement, you
should have the liberty of directing the actor in his
attempts; and as the Chinese does his ear-tickler,
8
tell him when his instrument offends, and how he
overdoes himself in the operation. This is an
egregious mistake: you are obliged to him for his
condescension
in exerting his talents for your
instruction
;
and as to your money, why he only
takes it to lessen
in part
the weight of your
obligation
.
An actor is, as I before observed, competent to
judge of his own abilities; he may undertake
whatever character he pleases, tragedy, comedy,
or pantomime, however ill adapted his audience
may think him to sustain it. He may rant and
roar, and wink and grin, and fret and fume his
hour upon the stage, and who shall say nay?
He is paid by the manager for using his lungs
and limbs, and the more he exerts them, the
better
does he fulfil the engagement, and the harder
does he
work
for his livingand who shall
deprive
him of his
hard-earned
bread?
How many an honest, lazy genius, has been
flogged by these unfeeling critics into a cultivation
of his talents, and attention to his profession!
how have they doomed him to hard study and
unremitting
exertion!how have they prejudiced the
public mind, so that what might once have put an
audience in convulsions of laughter, now excites
nothing but a slight pattering from the hands of
the little shavers who are rewarded with seats in
the gallery, for their trouble in keeping the boxes.
Oh! Mr. Oldstyle, it cuts me to the soul to see
a poor actor stamp and storm, and slap his
forehead
,
his breast, his pocket holes, all in vain; to
see him throw himself in some attitude of
distraction
or despair, and there wait in fruitless
expectation
the applauses of his friends in the gallery.
In such cases, I always take care and clap him
myself, to enable him to quit his posture, and
resume
his part with credit.
You was much irritated the other evening, at
what you termed an ungenerous and unmanly
attempt
to bring forward an ancient maiden in a
ridiculosu
point of view. But I don't see why that
should be made a matter of complaint. Has it
not been done time out of mind? Is it not
sanctioned
by daily custom in private life? Is not the
character of Aunt Tabitha, in the farce, the same
we have laughed at in hundreds of dramatic
pieces
?
Since, then, the author has but travelled in
the same
beaten track
of character so many have
trod before him, I see not why he should be
blamed as severely as if he had all the
guilt of
originality
upon his shoulders.
You may say that it is cruel to sport with the
feelings of any class of society; that folly affords
sufficient field for wit and satire to work upon,
without resorting to misfortune for matter of
ridicule
;
that female sensibility should ever be
sacred
from the lash of sarcasm, &c. But this is
all stuffall cant.
If an author is too indolent or too stupid to
seek new sources for remark, he is surely
excusable
in employing the ideas of others for his
own use and benefit. But I find I have digressed
imperceptibly into the rights of
authors
, so let
us return to our subject.
An actor, when he holds the mirror up to
nature
,
may, by his manuvres, twist and turn it
so as to represent the object in any shape he
pleasesnay, even give a caricature where the
author intended a resemblance; he may blur it with
his breath, or soil it with his dirty fingers, so that
the object may have a colouring from the glass in
which it is viewed, entirely different from its
natural
appearance. To be plain, my friend, an actor
has a right, whenever he thinks his author not
sufficiently explicit, to assist him by his own
wit
and
abilities;
and if by these means the character
should become quite different from what was
originally
intended, and in fact belong more to the
actor
than the
author
, the actor deserves high
credit for his ingenuity. And even though his
additions are
quaint
and fulsome, yet his
intention
is highly praiseworthy, and deserves ample
encouragement
.
Only think, my dear sir, how many snug little
domestic arrangements are destroyed by the
officious
interference of these ever dissatisfied critics.
The honest
King of Scotland
, who used to dress
for market and theatre at the same time, and
wear with his kelt and plaid his half boots and
black breeches, looking half king, half cobbler,
has been obliged totally to dismiss the former
from his royal service; yet I am happy to find, so
obstinate is his attachment to
old habits
, that all
their efforts have not been sufficient to dislodge
him from the strong hold he has in the latter.
They may force him from the bootsbut nothing
shall drive him out of the breeches.
Consider, my friend, the puerile nature of such
remarks. Is it not derogating from the elevated
character of a critic, to take notice of clubbed
wigs, red coats, black breeches, and half boots!
Fie! fie upon it! I blush for the critics of the
day, who consider it a matter of importance
whether a Highlander should appear in breeches
and boots, or an Otaheitan in the dress of a
New-York
coxcomb. Trust me, friend Oldstyle, it is
to the
manner
, not the
appearance
of an actor,
we are to look; and as long he performs his part
well, (to use the words of my friend Sterne,) it
shall not be inquired whether he did it in a black
coat or a red.
Believe me, friend Oldstyle, few of our modern
critics can show any substantial claim to the
character
they assume. Let me ask them one question
Have they ever been in Europe? Have they
ever seen a Garrick, a Kemble, or a Siddons? If
they have not, I can assure you, (upon the words
of two or three of my friends,
the actors
,) they
have no right to the title of critics.
They may talk as much as they please about
judgment, and taste, and feeling, but this is all
nonsense. It has lately been determined, (
at the
Theatre
,) that any one who attempts to decide
upon such ridiculous principles, is an arrant
goose
,
and deserves to be
roasted
.
Having thus, friend Oldstyle, endeavoured in a
feeble manner to show you a few of the rights of
an actor, and of his wrongs; having mentioned his
constant and
disinterested
endeavours to please
the public, and how much better he knows what
will please them, than they do themselves;
having also depicted the cruel and persecuting
nature of a critic; the continual restraint he lays
on the harmless irregularity of the performer, and
the relentless manner in which he obliges him to
attend sedulously to his professional duty, through
fear of censurelet me entreat you to pause!
Open your eyes to the precipice on which you are
tottering, and hearken to the earnest warning of
Your loving friend,
ANDREW QUOZ.
My friend Quoz certainly writes with
feeling;
every line evinces that
acute sensibility
for which
he has ever been remarked. I am, however,
perfectly
at a loss to conceive on what grounds he
suspects me of a disposition to turn critic. My
remarks hitherto have rather been the result of
immediate impression than of critical examination.
With my friend, Mr. Andrew Quoz, I begin to
doubt the motives of our New-York critics;
especially
since I have, in addition to these arguments,
the assurances of two or three doubtless
disinterested
actors, and an editor, who, Mr. Quoz tells
me, is remarkable for his
candour
and
veracity
,
that the critics are the most `presumptuous,'
`arrogant,' `malevolent,' `illiberal,' `
ungentlemanlike
,'
`malignant,' `rancorous,' `villanous,' `
ungrateful
,'
`crippled,' `invidious,' `detracting,'
`fabricating,' `personal,' `dogmatical,' `
illegitimate
,'
`tyrannical,' `distorting,' `spindle-shanked
moppets, designing villains, and upstart
ignorants
.'
These, I say, and many other equally
high
polished
appellations, have awakened doubts in my
mind respecting the sincerity and justice of the
critics; and lest my pen should unwittingly draw
upon me the suspicion of having a hankering after
criticism, I now wipe it carefully, lock it safely
up, and promise not to draw it forth again till some
new department of folly calls for my attention.
JONATHAN OLDSTYLE.
LETTER VIII.
Sir
,
I was calmly enjoying my toast and coffee
some mornings ago, with my sister Dorothy and
Jack Stylish, when we were surprised by the
abrupt
entrance of my friend, Mr. Andrew Quoz.
By the particular expression of his
knowing phiz
,
as cousin Jack calls it, I immediately perceived
he was labouring with some important
intelligence
.
In one hand he held the Morning Chronicle,
and with the fore-finger of the other, pointed to
a particular paragraph. I hastily put on my
spectacles
,
and seized the paper with eager curiosity.
Judge my surprise, Mr. Editor, on reading an act
of our legislature, pronouncing any citizen of this
state who shall send, bear, or accept a challenge,
either verbal or written, disqualified from holding
any office of honour or confidence, or of voting
at any election, within this state, &c. &c.
The paper fell from my handsI turned my
eyes to friend Andrew in mute astonishment.
Quoz put his finger on his nose, and winking
significantly
,
9
cried, what do you think of this, my
friend Jonathan?
Here is a catastrophe, exclaimed I, in a
melancholy
tone. Here is a damper for the
mettlesome
youths of the age. Spirit of chivalry,
whither hast thou flown! Shade of Don Quixote,
dost thou not look down with contempt on the
degeneracy of the times!
My sister Dorothy caught a sympathetic spark
of enthusiasm;deep read in all the volumes of
ancient romance, and delighted with the glowing
description of the heroic age, she had learned to
admire the gallantry of former days, and
mourned
to see the last spark of chivalric fire thus
rudely extinguished.
Alas! my brother, said she, to what a
deplorable
state are our young men reduced! how
piteous
must be their situationwith sensibilities so
easily injured
, and bosoms so
tremblingly alive
to the calls of honour and etiquette!
Indeed, my dear Dorothy, said I, I feel most
deeply for their melancholy situation. Deprived,
in these dull, monotonous, peaceable times, of all
opportunities of evincing, in the hardy contest of
the tented field, that heroic flame that burns
within
their breasts; they were happy to vent the
lofty
fumings of their souls, in the more domestic
and
less dangerous
encounters of the duel;
like the warrior in the fable, who, deprived of the
pleasure of slaughtering armies, contented
himself
with cutting down cabbages.
Here a solemn pause ensued. I called to mind
all the tales I had heard or read of ancient knights;
their amours, their quarrels, and their combats;
how, on a fair summer's morning, the knight of the
Golden Goose met the knight of the Fiery Fiddle;
how the knight of the Fiery Fiddle exclaimed in
lofty tones, whoever denies that Donna
Fiddleosa
is the most peerless beauty in the universe,
must brave the strength of this arm! how they
both engaged with dreadful fury, and, after
fighting
till sunset, the knight of the Fiery Fiddle fell
a martyr to his constancy; murmuring, in
melodious
accents, with his latest breath, the beloved
name of Fiddleosa.
From these ancient engagements, I descended
to others more modern in their dates, but equally
important in their origins. I recalled the genuine
politeness and polished ceremony with which
duels were conducted in my youthful days; when
that gentlemanly weapon, the
small sword
, was
in highest vogue. A challenge was worded with
the most particular complaisance; and one that
I have still in my possession, ends with the words,
your friend and affectionate servant, Nicholas
Stubbs
. When the parties met on the field, the
same decorum was observed; they pulled off their
hats, wished one another a good day, and helped
to draw off each other's coats and boots, with the
most respectful civility. Their fighting, too, was
so handsomely conducted; no awkward
movements
;
no eager and angry pushes; all cool,
elegant
,
and graceful. Every thrust had its
sa-sa;
and a
ha-hah
lunged you gently through the
body. Then nothing could equal the tenderness
and attention with which a wounded antagonist
was treated; his adversary, after wiping his sword
deliberately, kindly supported him in his arms,
examined his pulse, and inquired, with the most
affectionate solicitude, how he felt himself
now? Thus every thing was conducted in a
well-bred, gentlemanly manner.
Our present customs, I cannot say I much
admire
;
a
twelve inch barrel pistol
, and
ounce
ball
, are blunt, unceremonious affairs, and
prevent
that display of grace and elegance allowed
by the small sword; besides, there is something
so awkward, in having the muzzle of a pistol
staring
one full in the face, that I should think it
might be apt to make some of our youthful heroes
feel rather disagreeable; unless, as I am told has
been sometimes the case, the duel was fought by
twilight.
The ceremony of loading, priming, cocking,
&c. has not the most soothing effects on a
person's
feelings; and, I am told that some of our
warriors have been known to tremble, and make
wry faces, during these preparations;though
this has been attributed, and doubtless with much
justice, to the violence of their wrath, and
fierceness
of their courage.
I had thus been musing for some time, when I
broke silence at last, by hinting to friend Quoz,
some of my objections to the mode of fighting
with pistols.
Truly, my friend Oldstyle, said Quoz, I am
surprised at your ignorance of modern customs;
trust me, I know of no amusement that is,
generally
speaking, more harmless. To be sure, there
may now and then a couple of determined fellows
take the field, who resolve to do the thing in good
earnest; but, in general, our fashionable duellists
are content with only one discharge; and then,
either they are poor shots, or their triggers pull
hard, or they shut the wrong eye, or some other
cause intervenes, so that it is ten, ay, twenty
chances to one in their favour.
Here I begged leave to differ from friend
Andrew
.
I am well convinced, said I, of the valour
of our young men, and that they determine, when
they march forth to the field, either to conquer or
die; but it generally happens, that their seconds
are of a more peaceable mind, and interpose after
the first shot; but I am informed, that they come
often very near being killed, having bullet holes
through their hats and coats; which, like Falstaff's
hacked sword, are strong proofs of the serious
nature of their encounters.
My sister Dorothy, who is of a humane and
benevolent disposition, would, no doubt, detest
the idea of duels, did she not regard them as the
last gleams of those days of chivalry, to which
she looks back with a degree of romantic
enthusiasm
.
She now considered them as having
received
their death-blow; for how can even the
challenges be conveyed, said she, when the very
messengers are considered as principals in the
offence?
Nothing more easy, said friend Quoz;a man
gives me the lievery well; I tread on his toes in
token of challenge;he pulls my nose by way of
acceptance: thus, you see, the challenge is safely
conveyed without a third party. We then settle
the mode in which satisfaction is to be given;
as, for instance, we draw lots which of us must
be slain to satisfy the demands of honour. Mr.
A. or Mr. B., my antagonist, is to fall: well,
madam
,
he stands below in the street; I run up to
the garret window, and drop a brick upon his
head; if he survives, well and goodif he falls,
why nobody is to blame, it was purely accidental.
Thus, the affair is settled, according to the
common
saying, to our mutual satisfaction.
Jack Stylish observed, that, as to Mr. Quoz's
project of dropping bricks on people's heads, he
considered it a vulgar substitute. For his part,
he thought it would be well for the legislature to
amend their law respecting duels, and license
them under proper restrictions;That no persons
should be allowed to fight, without taking out a
regular license from what might be called the
Blood and Thunder Office;
That they should
be obliged to give two or three weeks notice of
the intended combat in the newspapers;That
the contending parties should fight, till one of
them fell;and that the public should be
admitted
to
the show
. This, he observed, would, in
some degree, be reviving the
spectacles
of
antiquity
,
when the populace were regaled with the
combats of gladiators. We have, at present, no
games resembling those of the ancients, except,
now and then, a bull or bear bait; and this
would be a valuable addition to the list of our
refined
amusements.
I listened to their discourse in silence: yet I
cannot but think, Mr. Editor, that this plan is
entitled
to some attention. Our young men fight,
ninety-nine times out of a hundred, through
fear
of being branded with the epithet of
coward
;
and since they fight to please the world, the world,
being thus interested in their encounters, should
be permitted to attend and judge in person of their
conduct.
As I think the subject of importance, I take
the liberty of requesting a corner in the
Morning
Chronicle, to submit it to the consideration
of the public.
JONATHAN OLDSTYLE.To
Jonathan Oldstyle
,
Gent.
MY DEAR FRIEND,
I perceive by the late papers, you have been
entertaining the town with remarks on the
Theatre
.
As you do not seem from your writings to be
much of an adept in the Thespian arcana, permit
me to give you a few hints for your information.
The Theatre, you observe, begins to answer all
the purposes of a coffee-house. Here you are right;
it is the polite lounge, where the idle and curious
resort, to pick up the news of the fashionable
world, to meet their acquaintances, and to show
themselves off to advantage. As to the dull souls
who go for the sake of the play, why, if their
attention is interrupted by the conversation of their
neighbours, they must bear it with patience; it is a
custom authorized by fashion. Persons who go
for the purpose of chatting with their friends are
not to be deprived of their amusement;
they have
paid their dollar
, and have a right to entertain
themselves as well as they can. As to those who
are annoyed by their talking, why they need not
listen to it;
let them mind their own business
.
You are surprised at so many persons using
opera glasses, and wish to know whether they were
all near-sighted. Your cousin, Jack Stylish, has
not explained that matter sufficiently, for though
many
mount
glasses because it is
the go
, yet I am
told that several do it to enable them to distinguish
the countenances of their friends across our scantily
illuminated Theatre. I was considerably amused
the other evening with an honest tar, who had
stationed himself in front of the gallery, and with
an air of affected foppishness, was reconnoitring
the house through a pocket telescope. I could
not but like his notion, for really the gods are so
elevated among the clouds, that unless they are
unusually strong of vision, I can't tell how they
manage to discern with the naked eye what is
passing in the little painted world below them.
I think you complain of the deficiency of the
music; and say that we want a greater variety, and
more of it. But you must know that, though this
might have been a grievance in old times, when
people attended to the musicians, it is a thing of
but little moment at present; our orchestra is kept
principally for form sake. There is such a
continual
noise and bustle between the acts, that it is
difficult to hear a note; and if the musicians were
to get up a new piece of the finest melody, so
nicely tuned are the ears of their auditors, that I
doubt whether nine hearers out of ten would not
complain on leaving the house, that they had been
bored to death with the same old pieces they have
heard two or three years back. Indeed, many
who go to the theatre carry their own music with
them; and we are so often delighted with the
crying
of children by way of glee, and such coughing
and sneezing from various parts of the house by
way of chorus, not to mention the regale of a sweet
symphony from a sweep or two in the gallery, and
occasionally a full piece, in which nasal, vocal,
whistling and thumping
powers are admirably
exerted and blended, that what want we of an
orchestra?
6
In your remarks on the actors, my dear friend,
let me beg of you to be cautious. I would not for
the world that you should
degenerate
into a critic.
The critics, my dear Jonathan, are the very pests
of society; they rob the actor of his reputation
the public of their amusement; they open the
eyes of their readers to a full perception of the
faults of our performers, they reduce our feelings
to a state of miserable refinement, and destroy
entirely
all the enjoyments in which our coarser
sensations
delighted. I can remember the time when
I could hardly keep my seat through laughing at
the wretched buffoonery, the merry-andrew tricks,
and the unnatural grimaces played off by one of
our theatric Jack Puddings; when I was struck
with awful admiration at the roaring and ranting of
a buskined hero, and hung with rapture on every
word, while he was tearing a passion to tatters
to very rags! I remember the time when he
who could make the queerest mouth, roll his eyes,
and twist his body with the most hideous
distortions
,
was surest to please. Alas! how changed
the times, or rather how changed the taste; I can
now sit with the gravest countenance, and look
without a smile on all such
mimicry;
their
skipping
,
their squinting, their shrugging, their
snuffling
,
delight not me; and as to their ranting and
roaring,
I'd rather hear a brazen candlestick turned,
Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree,
than any such fustian efforts to attain a shallow
gallery applause.
Now, though I confess these critics have
reformed
the manners of the actors, as well as the
tastes of the andience, so that these absurdities are
almost banished from the New-York stage, yet do
I think they have employed a most unwarrantable
liberty.
A critic, my dear sir, has no more right to expose
the faults of an actor, than he has to detect the
deceptions of a juggler, or the impositions of a
quack. All trades must live; and as long as the
public are satisfied to admire the tricks of the
juggler
,
to swallow the drugs of the quack, or to
applaud
the fustian of the actor, whoever attempts to
undeceive them, does but curtail the pleasures of
the latter, and deprive the former of their bread.
Ods-bud! hath not an actor eyes, and shall he not
wink?
hath not an actor teeth, and shall he not
grin?feet, and shall he not stamp?lungs,
and shall he not roar?breast, and shall he not
slap it?hair, and shall he not
club
it? Is he not
fed with plaudits from the gods? delighted with
thumpings from the groundlings? annoyed by hisses
from the boxes?
If you censure his follies, does he not complain?
If you take away his bread, will he not starve? If
you starve him, will he not die? And if you kill
him, will not his wife and seven small infants, six
at her back and one at her breast, rise up and cry
vengeance against you? Ponder these things
seriously
,
my friend Oldstyle, and you will agree with
me that, as the actor is the most meritorious and
faultless, so is the critic the most cruel and
sanguinary
character in the worldas I will show you
more fully in my next.
Your loving friend,
ANDREW QUOZ.To
Jonathan Oldstyle
,
Gent
.
MY DEAR FRIEND,
I once more address you on a subject that I
fear will be found irksome, and may chafe
that testy disposition (forgive my freedom) with
which you are afflicted. Exert, however, the good
humour of which, at bottom, I know you to have a
plentiful stock, and hear me patiently through. It
is the anxious fear I entertain of your sinking into
the gloomy abyss of criticism, on the brink of
which you are at present tottering, that urges me
to write.
I would set before you the rights and wrongs of
an
actor;
and by painting in strong colours the
peculiarity of his situation, call your good sense
into action.
The world, my friend Oldstyle, has ever been
prone to consider the theatrical profession in a
degraded point of view. What first gave rise to
this opinion, I am at loss to conceive; but I
consider it as the relic of one of those ancient
prejudices, which the good sense of the world is
daily discarding; and I flatter myself it will in a
little time be totally exploded. Why the actor
should be considered inferior in point of
respectability
to the poet, the painter, or any other person
who exerts his talents in delineating character, or
in exhibiting the various operations of the human
mind, I cannot imagine. I know you, friend
Oldstyle
,
to be a man of too liberal sentiments not to
be superior to these little prejudices; and also
one who regards an actor, provided his private
character be good, with equal respect as the
member
of any other profession. Yet you are not
quite aware of the important privileges solely
attached to the dramatic performer. These I
will endeavour to point out.
The works of a poet or painter you may freely
criticisenay, they offer them for that purpose
they listen attentively to your observations, and
profit by your censures. But beware how you
exercise such conduct towards an actor; he needs
no instructionhis own
impartial
judgment is
sufficient to detect and amend all his
imperfections
.
Attempt to correct his errors, and you
ruin him at oncehe'll
starve
to spite you; he is
like a decayed substance, that crumbles at the
touch.
No, Sirwhen an actor is on the stage, he is in
his own houseit is his castlehe then has you
in his powerhe may there
bore
you with his
buffoonery, or insult you with his pointed remarks,
with perfect impunity. You, my friend, who are
rather apt to be dissatisfied, may call it hard
treatment
,
to be thus annoyed, and yet compensate the
annoyer for his trouble. You may say, that as
you pay an equivalent for your amusement, you
should have the liberty of directing the actor in his
attempts; and as the Chinese does his ear-tickler,
8
tell him when his instrument offends, and how he
overdoes himself in the operation. This is an
egregious mistake: you are obliged to him for his
condescension
in exerting his talents for your
instruction
;
and as to your money, why he only
takes it to lessen
in part
the weight of your
obligation
.
An actor is, as I before observed, competent to
judge of his own abilities; he may undertake
whatever character he pleases, tragedy, comedy,
or pantomime, however ill adapted his audience
may think him to sustain it. He may rant and
roar, and wink and grin, and fret and fume his
hour upon the stage, and who shall say nay?
He is paid by the manager for using his lungs
and limbs, and the more he exerts them, the
better
does he fulfil the engagement, and the harder
does he
work
for his livingand who shall
deprive
him of his
hard-earned
bread?
How many an honest, lazy genius, has been
flogged by these unfeeling critics into a cultivation
of his talents, and attention to his profession!
how have they doomed him to hard study and
unremitting
exertion!how have they prejudiced the
public mind, so that what might once have put an
audience in convulsions of laughter, now excites
nothing but a slight pattering from the hands of
the little shavers who are rewarded with seats in
the gallery, for their trouble in keeping the boxes.
Oh! Mr. Oldstyle, it cuts me to the soul to see
a poor actor stamp and storm, and slap his
forehead
,
his breast, his pocket holes, all in vain; to
see him throw himself in some attitude of
distraction
or despair, and there wait in fruitless
expectation
the applauses of his friends in the gallery.
In such cases, I always take care and clap him
myself, to enable him to quit his posture, and
resume
his part with credit.
You was much irritated the other evening, at
what you termed an ungenerous and unmanly
attempt
to bring forward an ancient maiden in a
ridiculosu
point of view. But I don't see why that
should be made a matter of complaint. Has it
not been done time out of mind? Is it not
sanctioned
by daily custom in private life? Is not the
character of Aunt Tabitha, in the farce, the same
we have laughed at in hundreds of dramatic
pieces
?
Since, then, the author has but travelled in
the same
beaten track
of character so many have
trod before him, I see not why he should be
blamed as severely as if he had all the
guilt of
originality
upon his shoulders.
You may say that it is cruel to sport with the
feelings of any class of society; that folly affords
sufficient field for wit and satire to work upon,
without resorting to misfortune for matter of
ridicule
;
that female sensibility should ever be
sacred
from the lash of sarcasm, &c. But this is
all stuffall cant.
If an author is too indolent or too stupid to
seek new sources for remark, he is surely
excusable
in employing the ideas of others for his
own use and benefit. But I find I have digressed
imperceptibly into the rights of
authors
, so let
us return to our subject.
An actor, when he holds the mirror up to
nature
,
may, by his manuvres, twist and turn it
so as to represent the object in any shape he
pleasesnay, even give a caricature where the
author intended a resemblance; he may blur it with
his breath, or soil it with his dirty fingers, so that
the object may have a colouring from the glass in
which it is viewed, entirely different from its
natural
appearance. To be plain, my friend, an actor
has a right, whenever he thinks his author not
sufficiently explicit, to assist him by his own
wit
and
abilities;
and if by these means the character
should become quite different from what was
originally
intended, and in fact belong more to the
actor
than the
author
, the actor deserves high
credit for his ingenuity. And even though his
additions are
quaint
and fulsome, yet his
intention
is highly praiseworthy, and deserves ample
encouragement
.
Only think, my dear sir, how many snug little
domestic arrangements are destroyed by the
officious
interference of these ever dissatisfied critics.
The honest
King of Scotland
, who used to dress
for market and theatre at the same time, and
wear with his kelt and plaid his half boots and
black breeches, looking half king, half cobbler,
has been obliged totally to dismiss the former
from his royal service; yet I am happy to find, so
obstinate is his attachment to
old habits
, that all
their efforts have not been sufficient to dislodge
him from the strong hold he has in the latter.
They may force him from the bootsbut nothing
shall drive him out of the breeches.
Consider, my friend, the puerile nature of such
remarks. Is it not derogating from the elevated
character of a critic, to take notice of clubbed
wigs, red coats, black breeches, and half boots!
Fie! fie upon it! I blush for the critics of the
day, who consider it a matter of importance
whether a Highlander should appear in breeches
and boots, or an Otaheitan in the dress of a
New-York
coxcomb. Trust me, friend Oldstyle, it is
to the
manner
, not the
appearance
of an actor,
we are to look; and as long he performs his part
well, (to use the words of my friend Sterne,) it
shall not be inquired whether he did it in a black
coat or a red.
Believe me, friend Oldstyle, few of our modern
critics can show any substantial claim to the
character
they assume. Let me ask them one question
Have they ever been in Europe? Have they
ever seen a Garrick, a Kemble, or a Siddons? If
they have not, I can assure you, (upon the words
of two or three of my friends,
the actors
,) they
have no right to the title of critics.
They may talk as much as they please about
judgment, and taste, and feeling, but this is all
nonsense. It has lately been determined, (
at the
Theatre
,) that any one who attempts to decide
upon such ridiculous principles, is an arrant
goose
,
and deserves to be
roasted
.
Having thus, friend Oldstyle, endeavoured in a
feeble manner to show you a few of the rights of
an actor, and of his wrongs; having mentioned his
constant and
disinterested
endeavours to please
the public, and how much better he knows what
will please them, than they do themselves;
having also depicted the cruel and persecuting
nature of a critic; the continual restraint he lays
on the harmless irregularity of the performer, and
the relentless manner in which he obliges him to
attend sedulously to his professional duty, through
fear of censurelet me entreat you to pause!
Open your eyes to the precipice on which you are
tottering, and hearken to the earnest warning of
Your loving friend,
ANDREW QUOZ.
