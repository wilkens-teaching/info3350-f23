B
VERSES,
ADDRESSED TO A
YOUNG LADY,
ON HER LEAVING SCHOOL.
I wish
not, Ana, to offend,
But write the language of a friend;
For tho' my dear from
school
you're freed,
You've enter'd on a
task
indeed;
To act, as you proceed through life,
As daughter, mother, friend, and wife.
No doubt, within the
school
confin'd,
Your charming lively active mind,
By fancy's aid, contriv'd to
dress
,
Gay painted
scenes
of
happiness
;
And thought in all your future hours,
To find your pathway strew'd with flow'rs
Ah! lovely maid, too
soon
you'll find
Your
happiest
days are left behind!
To grief and
sorrow
we were born,
Each flow'er we
see
conceals a thorn;
Like traitors, who, with hidden dart,
First
soothe
and win, then wound the heart
Tho' life is an uneven road,
And tho' uncertain our abode,
Within this fragile
house
of clay,
Yet there are means to
smooth
the way;
From my experience
dearly
bought,
Blush
not, my Anna to be taught.
And
first
, dear girl, each morn and ev'n
Lift up your
spotless
soul
to heav'n,
The pow'r who gave you life adore,
His wrath
appease
, his grace implore;
'Tis our
first
duty; next to this,
Study your earthly parents
bliss
.
Increase
their joys,
soothe
all their cares,
And have no
wish
, no will but theirs;
Whate'er they bid you do or
say
Dispute
not, chearfully obey
Their
just
commands, and if
severe
,
Remonstrate
only with a tear:
For tho'
unkindness
grieves the heart,
Submission
is a daughter's part.
Part of your
happiness
depends
On a judicious choice of friends.
If e'er your heart's by grief
oppress
'd,
Repose
it in a mother's
breast
;
To her each
secret
thought impart,
Use
no
disguise
,
detest
all arts;
B 2
Be candid, open and
sincere
,
A mother's love you cannot fear,
She'll be a kind and faithful friend,
And teach you how each fault to mend.
To others be polite and kind,
But cautious how you
speak
your mind:
Yet
should
it be your
sate
to meet,
A woman prudent and
discreet
.
Whose
tongue to
slander
ne'er was prone,
Who makes your joys and griefs her own,
Prize her, for 'tis from bounteous heav'n,
The
choicest
gift that can be giv'n.
In
friendship
with the other
sex
Be cautious, they are apt to vex;
Nor vainly think that you
shall
prove
The
pleasures
of Platonic love:
It is a phantom in the way,
To lead poor
thoughtless
girls
astray
.
Tho' man by nature was
design
'd,
A guardian for weak woman kind,
Endow'd with
reason
,
sense
and care,
To
shield
from wrong the
helpless
fair.
No
sooner
did the tyrant
see
Woman from ev'ry
blemish
free,
Than
heedless
of his guardian part,
He
strove
, by mean
seductive
art,
To rob her of her
brightest
charms,
To fill her
breast
with wild alarms,
Revers'd kind nature's gentle plan,
And woman's now the
slave
of man.
To lovers act with
modest
spirit
,
Treat them according to their merit;
Encourage not, from
foolish
pride,
Fifty to dangle at your
side
:
But if you do not like a man,
Dismiss
him gently as you can;
Thank him, but
say
'twould be in vain,
Ever to urge his
suit
again.
But if the man whom you approve,
Should
softly
tell a tale of love;
Let your
flush
'd cheek and
downcast
eye
In
silence
modestly
reply;
Yet don't too
easily
believe,
For man, my Anna, will deceive.
If to misfortune's
school
you're brought,
Sad
sorrow
's
lesson
to be taught;
If fore'd from your dear parent's
side
,
To
pass
through life without a guide;
Be
circumspect
, be cautious, then,
Beware of all, but
most
of men.
For they will
study
to betray,
And make our
helpless
sex
their prey;
From virtue's bright refulgent throne
With baleful hand will drag you down;
Dishonour
first
, then leave to mourn
Those
blessings
which can ne'er return.
As the young bird who from the
nest
,
Its mother's fost'ring wings and
breast
Timidly ventures thro' the air,
Far from the tender parent's care;
B 3
If chance
some
hawk beholds it fly,
He views it with an eager eye,
Pursues
, and clench'd within his power,
It falls, poor bird, to
rise
no more.
When once the nuptial knot is tied,
And my
sweet
girl becomes a bride,
Be it your care to keep your own
The heart your virgin
sweetness
won.
Kind to his friends and
those
he loves,
Be
sure
to like whom he approves.
Let
neatness
o'er your
dress
preside
,
Let prudence all your actions guide;
Far from your
bosom
ever chace
The green-ey'd-fiend, and in its place
Encourage mutual confidence;
For
jealousy
, if not driv'n hence,
Will on your
inmost
vitals prey,
And
steal
your
soul
's
repose
away.
To
servants
gentlest
usage
give,
'Tis hard enough that they
must
live
In
servitude
, without ill-nature,
From
those
they
serve
, a fellow-creature,
Tho' plac'd in e'er
such
low degree,
Feels grief and pain as well as we.
In ev'ry
station
seek
not wealth,
Nor pray for aught
save
peace aad health;
For by mankind it is
confess
'd
The middle
sphere
is
still
the
best
,
Contentment there her throne will fix,
And fly the gilded coach and
six
.
If e'er your heart feels joy
sincere
,
'Twill be to dry affliction's tear;
To
visit
the
distress
'd and poor,
And chace pale famine from their door.
To humble merit be a friend,
The character,
aspersed
, defend.
While Anna thus her time employs,
Pure and unmix'd will be her joys;
Time, thus improv'd, glides gently on,
Nor will you find one day too long.
And when at length the hand of death,
Shall
steal
away your vital breath,
The
ghastly
king
shall
only be,
A
messenger
of joy to thee,
To take thee from this world below,
To one where joys ne'er
cease
to flow.
Plac'd on a throne and rob'd in white,
Too glorious far for mortal
sight
,
Joining the angels heav'nly lays,
Glorious immortal hymns of
praise
.
HISTORY OF MENTORIA.
Mentoria
, or rather Helena
Askham
,
was the only child of a brave
soldier
,
who, though born to move in but an humble
sphere
, had courage, magnanimity, and fortitude,
that might have become a
staff
officer, but he never
rose
to higher rankthan a
serjeant
, in which
station
he acquitted
himself
with
so
much honor, that he
was
universally
esteemed
by his
superiors
, and
beloved
by his equals. He was, at an early age,
married to the daughter of a reputable
tradesman
,
who preferring the
hardships
of war, to a
separation
from her
husband
,
resolutely
followed him to every
campaign. It was at the
siege
of Quebec, that our
gallant veteran was wounded and left dead on the
field: his faithful partner, unable to
support
the
shocking
tidings which were abruptly conveyed to
her, fell into premature labour, and in giving birth
to a female infant, rendered up her own life.
Colonel Dormer was acquainted with the
circumstance
,
and determined to protect a poor little
orphan ordered it to be provided with
and when he wrote to England,
taken,
requesting
she
would permit the little
Helena
to be
sent
over to be educated with her
daughters
.
Her
ladyship
acquiesced
, and Helena
arrived
safe
in England, when only two years old,
and was immediately admitted into the
nursery
among
the little Winworths, and as
she
grew up
enjoyed with them the benefit of a polite and
liberal education.
The young Lord Winworth, as he advanced
towards manhood, could not behold the young
orphan without
some
emotions of
tenderness
.
Helena
was
pleasing
in her
person
, and elegant in
her manners, but
she
was endowed with
discernment
and
sense
far
superior
to the generality of young
women of her age. She
possessed
sensibility
enough
to be unable to
listen
with
coldness
and
inattention
to the ardent
professions
of a young
nobleman
,
who to the advantages of birth and fortune,
added a
prepossessing
figure, and every polite
accomplishment---but
she
knew that he was
extremely
young, and that, in all probability, however
eager at that time to enter into
indissoluble
engagements
,
he would hereafter repent his
precipitancy
,
and regret that he had not matched with
one more
suitable
in rank and fortune. She
also
reflected that
she
should
, by accepting him,
disappoint
the hopes of his mother, and prove
herself
ungrateful to a woman who had ever treated
her with maternal
tenderness
. And
shall
I,
said
she
, for the gratification of a
passion
which has perhaps
arose
from
childish
fondness
,
and only gains
strength
by not being
opposed
,
entail on
myself
the anger of my
best
benefac
tors, and lay
myself
open to the
sneers
of the
world, by matching
so
far above my expecta
tions, nay, will not my
husband
be laughed at
for
raising
a poor orphan to his rank and title.
I am determined to
stifle
this
rising
passion
,
and to inform my Lady of the unfortunate at
tachment of her
son
.
This judicious
resolution
she
immediately put
in execution. Lady Winworth
listened
to her
with a mixture of
surprise
and admiration. My
dear Helena,
said
she
, you
shall
never want
a friend while I
exist
. This generous conduct
has rendered you more amiable than ever. My
son
is but a boy, I will
send
him abroad, and
in all human probability a few years
spent
at
some
of the
gayest
Courts in Europe, will entirely
eradicate
this youthful
penchant
.
When the young gentleman was informed of
his mother's
desire
that he
should
travel, he flew
to Helena, and
earnestly
entreated her to
consent
to a private marriage before his departure. She
laughed at his importunity, though her little heart
was ready to rebel, and
she
found to laugh (
however
repugnant to her feelings) was the only way
to avoid an affecting interview. Her mirth piqued
him. You do not love me, Helena,
said
he.
I never told you I did, my Lord. But your
looks, your actions, have contributed to make
me think you did. Why, my good Lord,
said
she
smiling
, I do love you
most
affectionately,
and
wish
for nothing more than to
see
you happy.
Then why not
consent
to our immediate union?
cried he eagerly.
Because
I love you as a
brother
,
and hope to
see
you, when you return,
married to
some
lady of birth, merit, and
fortune
,
and to figure as bride-maid on the
occasion
.
Unaccountable girl,
said
he,
peevishly
,
then only
promise
me to remain
single
till
my return. Indeed I
shall
not, my Lord, for
I have no intention to wear a willow garland; and
sure
I am, that
should
I make
such
a
promise
, we
should
both repent it before the year was out.
Nay, Madam,
said
he, angrily, if you are
of
so
light a
disposition
----- It is even
so
,
cried
she
, with affected vivacity, therefore, as
you are warned, pray beware, and think no more
of
so
trifling and
inconstant
a character.
When Helena retired to her own apartment,
she
gave free vent to her feelings; and in order to
avoid the pain of parting,
requested
permission
of
Lady Winworth, to pay a
visit
to a young lady,
who lived
some
miles from town. The old Lady
saw
the propriety of her
request
, and immediately
granted it. She therefore departed the next
morning
,
leaving only a card,
wishing
his
lordship
health and much
pleasure
in the
course
of his
travels
.
So
striking
a proof of her indifference
increased
his
resentment
, and he left England
without
any of
those
pangs which he imagined he
should
suffer
when
separated
from his Helena.
The event proved that Helena was right; for
when Lord Winworth returned, he brought with
him a bride, lovely, amiable, and his equal in
rank and fortune. When his
lordship
left
England
,
he took with him a young gentleman, as a
travelling companion; this gentleman did not
see
Helena previous to his departure, but at his return,
charmed with her innocent vivacity and judicious
conduct,
requested
permission
to pay his
addresses
;
which was immediately granted, and on their
union he was
presented
with a
post
under
government
,
which he enjoyed till his death.
Helena being then left in rather
straitened
circumstances
,
was
requested
to become
governess
to
the daughters of Lord Winworth;
she
consented
,
on condition that they might be permitted to retire
with her into the country. His
lordship
purchased
a
small
estate
in Wales, and thither
she
retired
with her young charge.
On the death of his wife, Lord Winworth
requested
her to bring his girls to town, and become
their conductor in public, as
she
had been their
preceptress in private: but this
she
resolutely
refused
.
On the
separation
of the young ladies from
their kind,
almost
maternal friend, they
requested
a continued
correspondence
might be kept up
between
them. Mentoria was the appellation they
had ever given her, and under this name was the
correspondence
commenced.
As her letters are
interspersed
with
entertaining
tales
apposite
to the
subjects
on which
she
wrote, I have avoided giving any of the young
ladies' letters, as they would only prove an
interruption
to the general
design
.
LETTER I.
Mentoria, to the Miss Winworths.
After
being
accustomed
to the
society
of
my dear
Miss
Winworths for fifteen years,
how
solitary
and
comfortless
is my
situation
. I
every day feel my
loss
more
severely
. I look at
the harpsichord and expect my Sophia to come
and
practise
her favorite
lessons
. I take up a
book, and
almost
unknown to
myself
, call on
Emily to read
some
passage
that
pleases
or
interests
C
me. I
miss
the dear lively
sallies
of
Gertrude
,
and the innocent prattle of Letitia: but
though I
so
severely
feel the privation of your
beloved
society
, I am not
so
selfish
as to
wish
you
again in the
shades
of Cambray. I am certain of
the
necessity
of your taking a part in the active
scenes
of life, and as your dear mother is now no
more, your father will
necessarily
require the
cheerfulness
of his children to brighten his
solitary
hours, and it was but
just
that my beloved
girls
should
appear in the
station
they were born
to ornament.
I highly commend the prudence of your
father
,
in taking Mrs. Clairville into his family, to
be your
chaperone
on your
first
entrance into
fashionable
circles. She is a woman who has
seen
a great deal of polite life, has ever retained an
unblemished
reputation, and though reduced by
misfortune to be glad to accept the
situation
your
father offered her, has ever been received as a
guest
whose
presence
conferred an obligation, by
some
of the
first
families in England.
Though
separated
from you, I
shall
, as you
desire
,
still
continue your
preceptress
, and
shall
not at any time
scruple
to tell you of your faults;
for partial as I am to your virtues, I am by no
means blind to
those
errors to which human
nature
is ever
subject
, and which, if not timely
eradicated
,
will gain an
ascendancy
over your mind,
and entirely hide
those
amiable qualities, which
at
present
form the
most
striking
traits in your
character.
And to begin---I feel
myself
greatly hurt and
offended by the letter I received from Gertrude,
since
your arrival in London. When it was
first
delivered into my hands, a joyful
sensation
diffused
itself
over my heart, and while reading the
tender
expressions
of grateful affection that
seemed
to flow
spontaneous
from your pen, it expanded
with
pleasure
; but when I came to
these
words,
My father received us with great affection, and
has been very bountiful in
presents
, cloaths,
pocket-money, &c. but yet for all that, my dear
Madam, I cannot feel that perfect affection for
him, which I know I ought. He has a great
many
peculiarities,
some
of them by no means
pleasing
;
and my
sisters
all agree, he is very much of
the
Bashaw
.
Good Heavens!
said
I, and is this all the fruit I
am likely to reap from the pains I have taken
to
instil
into the minds of
those
dear girls a
just
idea of what is meant by the words, Filial Duty.
That the very
first
letter I receive
should
point
at the little foibles of a parent, who they
acknowledge
received them with affection, and has
been extremely bountiful to them. Believe me,
C 2
my dear children, if you
wish
to
pass
through
life with any degree of
pleasure
to
yourselves
,
you
must
early learn to
submit
, without
murmuring
,
to the will of your father; be blind to his
errors, or if they are
so
glaring that you
cannot
avoid
seeing
them, never
expose
them, or
suffer
others to
speak
disrespectfully
of him in
your
presence
.
You
must
sacrifice
your own
wishes
to his,
you
must
study
his
happiness
and
ease
, and
in
so
doing will
most
assuredly promote your
own.
You no doubt remember the amiable Mrs.
Railton, who favored me with her company for
a few weeks
last
summer
. I
yesterday
received
news of her death, and as I am certain example
is ever more efficacious than precept, I will give
you a
slight
sketch
of her
history
, as a model by
which every young woman who
wishes
to
promote
her own felicity, will regulate her
conduct
.
Mr. George Campbell was the youngest
son
of a wealthy baronet, who having
several
livings
in his gift,
besides
good
interest
at Court, brought
him up to the church, with the
sanguine
expectation
of one day
seeing
him a
bishop
.
Unfortunately for George, before he had
attained
his twenty-third year he became attached
to a young lady, who had every
requisite
to
render the married
state
happy, but money---
and money being the old gentleman's darling
idol, he
consequently
thought
she
possessed
no
requisite
worthy the wife of his
son
; but George
was too far engaged to retreat with honor, he
therefore told his father, he was
resolved
upon
the union, and in a few days
presented
his
beloved
Louisa
to entreat his
blessing
.
When Sir James found they were really
married
,
he thought it was in vain to fly in a
passion
,
he received them cordially, and gave them an
universal
invitation to his
house
, but in his heart
he never forgave them. The livings were
disposed
of to other people, and at his death he
left the whole of his
estates
to his
eldest
son
.
Mr. Campbell had only a curacy of about
eighty pounds a year, and as regular as the year
came round, his wife
presented
him with a child.
Poverty took up her habitation among them, and
he bitterly regretted having, by an act of
disobedience
,
not only brought on
himself
his father's
displeasure
, but involved an amiable woman,
whom he loved, in a
scene
of penury and
distress
.
These
reflections four'd his
disposition
, he became
peevish
and
morose
, nay
sometimes
went
so
far, as
C 3
to reproach his wife as the
cause
of his abject
situation
.
Mrs. Campbell took great care to
instil
into
the minds of her children the
respect
and
affection
due from them to their father. My dear
children,
she
would often
say
, be
assured
, a
breach of filial duty is ever attended with regret,
and in general with misfortune.
Louisa
was the
eldest
of five children,
she
was
mild, meek, and affectionate. She attentively
listened
to the precepts of her mother, and laid
them up in her heart as an
inestimable
treasure
.
Mr. Campbell's temper grew
so
extremely bad,
that not only his wife, but his children came in
for a
share
of his ill-humour.
Louisa
, in
particular
,
was
sure
to be wrong, in whatever
she
said
or did, and it was
seldom
she
was favoured with a
kind or affectionate word, yet her manners were
so
amiable and her form
so
lovely, that though
she
laboured under the
disadvantages
of a narrow
education and extreme poverty, her company was
courted by
some
of the
genteelest
families in the
village, but in compliance with her father's
ill-humour
,
she
was
seldom
allowed to
stir
from
home.
When
Louisa
had reached her
seventeenth
year,
Lady Mary Campbell, a
distant
relation of her
father's, came on a
visit
to a family who
resided
in the
same
village.
Louisa
's good qualities were
resounded
to Lady Mary from every mouth, and
all
unanimously
agreed it was a pity
so
lovely a
girl
should
be buried in
obscurity
, and
lost
for want
of a proper education.
Lady Mary was naturally of a humane
disposition
,
she
expressed
a
desire
to
see
Miss
Campbell,
and when introduced to her, finding her even
superior
to what
she
had been taught to expect, made
her an offer of going with her to London.
This was a
proposal
too much to
Louisa
's
advantage
to be
refused
; the invitation was accepted,
and the
visit
prolonged for three years, during
which time
Louisa
had an opportunity of
improving
herself
in the ornamental as well as
useful
branches of education.
Mrs. Campbell, who had for many years
laboured
under an evident decline, was now
summoned
home by that power, who had been
pleased
in this life to try her with long and heavy
afflictions
.
Lady Mary carried
Louisa
to receive the
dying
blessing
, and pay the
last
duties to her
amiable
mother.That
finished
,
she
proposed
her
return to London. The lovely girl, penetrated
with gratitude for the many favours
she
had
received
and tenderly attached to her generous
benefactress
,
with difficulty
restrained
her tears,
while
she
thus
addressed
her
Think me not ungrateful, dear Madam, if I
beg to remain with my father; my brothers and
sisters
are engaged in learning occupations which
may enable them to
pass
through life with
industry
and without reproach. I cannot leave my
father in this
solitude
after
so
recent an
affliction
:
he has been for many years
used
to the
unremitting
attention and
tenderness
of my excellent
mother, I
must
not
suffer
him too
severely
to feel
her
loss
, but endeavour, as far as in my power,
by affection and affiduity, to
supply
her place.
And can you, my dear
Louisa
,
said
her
Ladyship
,
so
easily
forego the
ease
and plenty you
have enjoyed with me, to live a life of penury
and labour, and that for a man, who, though he is
your father, I
must
say
, does not
deserve
such
attention
did
he not always treat you with
unmerited
harshness
?
Hold, my dear Madam,
said
Louisa
; if,
as you think, my father has not behaved to me
with the
kindness
of a parent, it by no means
releases
me from my duty to him; had he a
thousand
errors he is my father
still
; as
such
I am
called upon by nature and religion to do every
thing in my power to render his life comfortable;
it my endeavours to
please
can awaken his
affection
I
shall
think
myself
amply repaid; if not,
the
consciousness
of having performed my duty,
will give me a
satisfaction
which no future event
can ever rob me of.
It was in vain Lady Mary urged her to return
---the lovely, elegant,
accomplished
Louisa
,
preferred
a low roofed
mansion
,
scanty
meals, and
attendance on a
sick
peevish
father, to the lofty
apartments, plenteous table, and variety of
amusements
she
might have enjoyed with Lady Mary.
She attended him to the
last
, and by her tender
solicitude
and affection
smoothed
the down-hill of his
life, and cheared and comforted him in the
most
painful
illness
by her unaffected piety; he was
moved by her filial duty, all the father
rushed
upon
his
soul
, he
blessed
her with his parting breath,
and expired in her arms.
You may, perhaps, enquire, what benefit
Louisa
reaped from this rigid performance of her duty?
The
question
is
easily
answered
. She gained a
contented happy mind,
serenity
dwelt in her heart
and
chearfulness
beamed from her eyes.
She had a genteel competency left her at Lady

MENTORIA.
LETTER II.
I am
sorry
, my dear ladies to be under the
disagreeable
necessity
of again taking up my pen
to reprove.
Your letters to me of late, have arrived
so
seldom
,
and when they do arrive, are
so
short
,
so
filled with
dress
,
visits
, and parties of
pleasure
,
that I
almost
doubt whether
some
demon has not
imitated your hand-writing, to
impose
upon me;
for I can find no
vestige
of
those
sentiments
I
so
anxiously
strove
to inculcate in your minds while
in the
shades
of Cambray: from the tenor of your
letters, I
should
imagine you live entirely in a
crowd, if
so
, you certainly have no time to
attend
to
those
improvements I
so
strongly
recommended
to you not to neglect.
You
seem
also
to have taken an unaccountable
dislike
to Mrs. Clairville. You
say
your father
is a great deal too partial to her; this appears to
me the evident effect of envy or
jealousy
; your
father being perfectly
sensible
of that lady's merit,
and
conscious
that her
situation
in his family is
rather humiliating, by treating her with
uncommon
respect
,
shews
the
goodness
of his heart, and
sets
an example which I
should
rejoice to find my
dear girls would follow.
Another thing which
seriously
alarms me for
your future
happiness
is, to find you have your
friends and
secrets
, and form little cotteries, of
which neither your father nor Mrs. Clairville
have any knowledge; believe me, you cannot be
too cautious in the choice of your intimates, many
a girl,
whose
intentions have been perfectly
innocent
,
has
lost
her reputation, by
associating
with
women
whose
levity has rendered their characters
suspicious
. You cannot find in the whole circle
of your acquaintance, a friend
so
sincere
as your
natural parent, to him you may without
reserve
,
communicate every
wish
of your hearts, for
trust
me, when I
say
, every thought you would
hesitate
to reveal to a parent,
must
be totally improper to
be harboured in your
bosom
. Perhaps you will
tell me, that having no mother, there are
some
emotions
of the heart, which the natural timidity and
delicacy of your
sex
would render it extremely
painful to communicate to a father.
As I am
sensible
of the truth of this
assertion
, I
must
recommend to you to
chuse
a friend from
among
those
most
esteemed
by your father, let her
be
some
years older than
yourself
, (for age, in
general
,
learn experience in the arts of the world)
and by her advice,
she
may, in
some
measure
guard you from
salling
a prey to the
dissimulation
of many pretenders to love or
friendship
, who
will
assume
the
semblance
of attachment, to draw
the
unsuspecting
youthful heart into improper
connections
,
which too often terminate in their ruin.
A numerous acquaintance is, in general, of
dangerous
consequence
to young women, as it is
impossible
but in a multiplicity of characters there
may be
some
,
whose
conversation
and example it
would be improper to follow, and
such
is the frail
state
of human nature, that bad habits are
easily
contracted, and can
seldom
if ever be eradicated.
A girl
just
entering the
state
of womanhood,
especially
if
she
is
possessed
of any
personal
or
mental
accomplishments
, and of an open ingenuous
temper is
surrounded
with innumerable dangers;
her reputation is of as delicate a texture, and may
be as
easily
injured, as the
fairest
blossom
; the
malignant
whisperings
of envy, or the
pestiserous
breath of
slander
, may in an
instant
blast
it; it
will droop under the keen eye of
suspicion
, and
too often
those
who
most
pretend to admire its
sweets
, will rudely pluck it from its parent
stalk
,
deprive it of all its beauties, then throw it from
them like a
loathsome
weed, leave it to
perish
unpitied and unregarded, and to be trod to
the earth by every unfeeling
passenger
, who may
perhaps
cast
on it a look of contempt, and cry,
Behold the once lovely.
There are many women in the world lovely
in their
persons
, elegant and engaging in their
manners, who are yet very improper connections
for girls, who
wish
to
preserve
their reputation
unsullied
; of this
description
I greatly fear your
favorite Matilda is----the
strong
dislike
she
expresses
at the idea of your bringing either your
father or Mrs. Clairville to
see
her, convinces me
there
must
be
something
in her character which
she
would not like to have
discovered
.
Remember
it was at a public ball you
first
formed an
acquaintance with her; that a gentleman
introduced
her to you, and chance afterwards led you
in a morning
excursion
to ride by her little
chateau;
you
confess
she
lives in an elegant
manner
,
that
she
is highly
accomplished
, and yet is
always by
herself
. Would any woman of
character
and fortune, do you think, live thus
recluse
,
have no female friends to
associate
with,
no little chearful parties to enliven her
solitude
,
and when
she
went into public, would
she
go only
accompanied by gentlemen? You
say
there is an
air of
mystery
about her; and, believe me, if
D
that
mystery
was developed, it would
discover
nothing to her advantage. Let me intreat my
dear girls to drop the acquaintance, or inform
your father of it: if after a proper enquiry
concerning
her character, he
should
approve the
continuation
of your
visits
, I
shall
be happy to find
you have
so
agreeable a member added to your
society
, and
severely
blame
myself
for having
judged
so
harshly
.
I
should
not have
so
many fears concerning
your intimacy with Matilda, had I not,
some
years
ago, known a very amiable girl, who entirely
forfeited her good name, and in the end her
life, by
associating
with a woman of light
character
.
Harriet Harding had the misfortune to
lose
her
mother when very young, and at a very early age
took upon
herself
the choice of her own
acquaintance
.
She had been at the play one night, when
a lady in the
same
box had
shewn
her many
civilities
,
and at parting gave her a card, and begged
to have the honour of
seeing
her.
Mr. Harding had remarked what
passed
, and
on returning home, warned his daughter
against
forming any acquaintance with her, as
she
was a
woman publicly kept by a man of
fashion
.
Harriet was giddy,
thoughtless
and fond of
pleasure
; chance threw her again in the way
of Amelia, and
she
entirely forgot her
father's
injunction. A
strict
intimacy
ensued
,
she
was frequent in her
visits
to Amelia, often went
with her into public, and was charmed with the
incense
of flattery that was offered to her by the
men. Mr. Harding had
business
which called
him to a
distant
part of England, Harriet was left
mistress
of her own actions, and
chose
this
opportunity
to go with Amelia on an
excursion
in
the country; in this
excursion
they were attended
by the gentleman who kept Amelia, and one of
his friends, who was particular in his attentions
to Harriet; the time flew on the wings of
pleasure
,
and when they returned to town, (Mr.
Harding being
still
absent
) it was
proposed
she
should
accompany the party to a
masquerade
.
Harriet was a
stranger
to this
sort
of
amusement
,
her
spirits
were exhilerated
she
did not think of
leaving it till a late hour, and when
she
mentioned
going home Amelia was not to be found. The
gentleman who had been her protector all the
evening, begged
permission
to
see
her home,
she
consented
, and at the hour of five in the
morning
arrived at her father's
house
; a
servant
who
had
arose
early to perform
some
particular work
let her in, and the gentleman followed her up
stairs
. She was
surprised
, but could not be
so
D 2
rude as to tell him to leave the
house
; but how
was her
surprise
increased
, when throwing
aside
his
mask
and domino, he proceeded to take
liberties
she
had ever been
used
to think of with
abhorrence. Unable to defend
herself
from his
insults
,
she
shrieked
aloud, and in a moment
her father, who had returned the evening before,
burst
into the room---her
shame
and terror
overcame
her, and
she
fainted; an explanation
ensued
between the father and the gentleman who
had
insulted
her, who
shocked
at the impropriety
of his behaviour
asked
Mr. Harding's pardon, and
staying
till Harriet was recovered, gave her this
advice at parting.
I
trust
, my dear young lady, this will be a
warning to you in future, how you
choose
your
intimates. Amelia is a woman
so
publicly known,
that it was next to
impossible
for you not to have
been acquainted with the
lightness
of her
character
,
I am now fully convinced that you are a
woman
of
strict
honour, but, believe me, till this
day I always thought you a girl who had either no
reputation to
lose
, or paid very little attention to
so
material a concern. I am
sorry
to
say
there are
numbers of
persons
, of both
sexes
, who have
seen
you with Amelia, who think the
same
, and
whom it will be a very difficult matter to convince
to the contrary; let me beg of you to break off
a connection
so
derogatory to your honor, and
by the future propriety of your conduct regain
that reputation, which your intimacy with
so
infamous
a woman has
considerably
injured.
Harriet could
answer
only with her tears, which
flowed
plenteously
, not only at hearing
these
disagreeable
truths, but from the reflection, that
when the
stranger
was gone
she
had
still
her
father's
anger to endure; had this been all, Harriet
might have thought
herself
happy, as by her
future
behaviour
she
might have hoped to regain his
confidence and favour, but the
heedless
girl too
soon
found, that not only her father watched her
actions with a
suspicious
eye, but all her female
friends received her
visits
with
coldness
, forbore
to return them, and in a
short
time entirely
dropped her acquaintance; to add to her
mortification
,
a young gentleman who had for
some
time
addressed
her on an honourable
score
, broke
off the connection, and
she
found
herself
as
solitary
and as much neglected as though
she
lived
in a
desert
.
The
consequence
was, that on her father's
decease
, which happened
soon
after, finding
herself
without
society
,
she
renewed her intimacy
with Amelia, and from being
accustomed
to an
intimate acquaintance with vice in others,
she
sunk
so
low as to
practise
it
herself
, without
compunction or
remorse
; till overtaken by
disease
D 3
and want (the
sure
attendants on riot and
intemperance)
she
sunk
to an early grave, a
victim to her own folly.
You
see
, my dear girls, Harriet was not
naturally
of a depraved inclination,
she
shrunk
with
horror from the
first
approach of vice; her
attachment
to Amelia was founded on a love of
pleasure
,
she
enjoyed every luxury while with her,
led a life of indolence, and was continually
receiving
presents
of
something
to decorate her
person
;
these
were indulgences
she
could not enjoy
at home, for though Mr. Harding was a very
substantial
tradesman
, he would by no means
allow
his daughter to launch into extravagance,
either
in her
housekeeping
,
dress
, or
pleasure
---he
wished
to
see
every hour
usefully
employed, and
as youth in general are much more fond of
pleasure
than employment, Harriet was delighted
with the acquaintance of a woman in
whose
society
she
could enjoy the one in its
utmost
extent,
without ever hearing of the other.
I know my dear girls will tell me, there is no
danger of Matilda drawing them into any
improper
scenes
, by gratifying their
desire
of
dissipation
,
since
their father indulgently allows them
to enjoy every
pleasurable
amusement
the
metropolis
affords. But you are totally unacquainted
with the world, there are a
thousand
ways by which
an artful woman may
steal
upon the
undesigning
heart, a
thousand
ways by which
she
may lead
them to
destruction
. Be wife then, my
sweet
young friends, and drop this acquaintance, before
you feel any of its
disagreeable
consequences
.
I
shall
in
some
future letter give you a few hints
concerning the proper
use
of time, certain that
however
harsh
you may for a moment think my
reproofs, the native
goodness
of your hearts, will
convince you they are meant
solely
for your good,
and that you have not a more affectionate friend
than
MENTORIA.
LETTER III.
MENTORIA TO MISS WINWORTHS.
My Dear Girls,
In
my
last
I gave you a
striking
instance
of the
dangerous tendency of improper acquaintance;
be
assured
, there are more women led into errors
by the bad precepts and examples of their own
sex
, than you would be apt to imagine, not only
in
forseiting
their good name, but every
pretension
to
happiness
. I do not know how
otherwise
to account for
so
many lovely, amiable women
entailing
misery
upon
themselves
and their
posterity
,
than by the romantic ideas they entertain of
love and
friendship
.
Love, my dear children, is a noble, generous
passion
, and when kept under the guidance of
reason
,
exalts and elevates the human
soul
; but the
juvenile mind is apt to
mistake
a
transient
likeing
,
or a
sudden
impulse
of gratified vanity, for
love; and many a girl from at
first
being
pleased
with the company of
those
who
indiscriminately
offer the
incense
of adulation to every young
female
begins to fancy one more particular than the
rest
, and that one is undoubtedly
designed
to be
her
husband
. From the moment this idea takes
place,
Miss
is
most
violently in love,
sleeping
or
waking the dear youth is continnally in her
thoughts,
she
lives but in his
presence
, when he is
absent
she
only
exists
. She
unbosoms
herself
to
some
dear girl nearly of her own age, and
she
being
her friend and confidant, the
secret
is to be kept
inviolable. For want of
some
laudable
pursuit
to
employ her time and engage her attention,
she
indulges her
foolish
penchant
, which originated
first
in vanity and was afterwards
nursed
by
fancy, till at length
she
is in reality attached to a
man, who perhaps never entertained a
serious
thought of her; he marries
some
other woman,
and
Miss
is left to
sigh
at her hard fate,
complain
of the perfidy of mankind, and indulge in
a luxury of delicate ideal
misery
. Nor is this
all, her dear and faithful friend betrays her
secret
to all the
Misses
of her acquaintance, who
(though perhaps guilty of the
same
foliy
themselves
)
will not
scruple
to laugh at what they will
term, her
indiscreet
and
foolish
conduct.
Though
such
a
situation
is certainly
sufficiently
mortifying, yet it is by no means the
worst
that
may happen. A girl who imagines
she
must
be
in love with the
first
man who
says
a few civil
things to her, lays
herself
open to the
designs
of
the object of her ideal
passion
, who if he
should
happen to be an artful man, may take advantage
of her partiality and credulity, to draw her into
indissoluble
engagements, which is in general
the
case
when there is a fortune in the way, or
where that charm is wanting, to plunge her
into infamy.
I once knew a girl, who,
possessed
of every
advantage which could be derived from wealth,
beauty, honorable relations, and a polite liberal
education, at the early age of eighteen fell a
victim to a romantic
passion
, and in the very
moment
when
she
sacrificed
the regard of her friends,
the hopes of future advancement in life, in
short
,
every thing that was valuable,
she
fancied
she
had
done a
praise
-worthy action, by evincing her
constancy
and
disinterested
attachment to the
object
of her
first
love.
Belinda Dormer went to the
same
school
with
me, we contracted a great
friendship
for each
other, and when the holidays
separated
us, by
calling each to her
respective
home, we
treasured
up every little incident in our memories,
whether of pain or
pleasure
, that when we met
we might exchange confidence, and live over our
pleasures
, or
soothe
the remembrance of our
little
uneasinesses
by participation.
Bell was a lovely brown girl, elegant in her
form,
accomplished
in her manners, and lively
in her
disposition
; her heart was tender and
affectionate
,
without the
least
tincture of art or
affectation, good-natured,
easy
, and credulous.
She left
school
at the age of
seventeen
, and was
ushered
into the world, prepared to admire her,
for
she
was reputed
heiress
to an
immense
fortune
.
The
Christmas
before
she
was taken home,
during the holidays, her father gave a ball in
honor of her birth-day, a young officer,
whose
only recommendation was an
handsome
person
and polite
address
, and who depended on Mr.
Dormer for farther advancement in the army,
requested
the honor of her hand, and in the
course
of the evening danced
himself
so
far
into
her
esteem
, that
she
implicitly believed him,
when he told her
she
was the
loveliest
creature
in the world, and that he
should
be
miserable
if
she
did not
suffer
him to hope he was not
altogether
indifferent to her.
Mr. Dormer had placed great confidence in
this young man, he had taken him from a
state
of
abject penury, placed him at a genteel academy,
and when he imagined him capable of
discharging
his duty, as became a man of honor and a
soldier
,
purchased
him an
ensign
's
commission
in
a regiment going to America, where he
raised
himself
to the rank of captain, and was now
just
returned to England. Mr. Dormer ever
intended
to be the friend and patron of young Horton,
but never dreamt of his
aspiring
to his daughter,
he therefore gave him a general invitation to his
house
, nor once thought but that his gratitude and
honor would be
sufficient
to prevent his forming
any improper
designs
on the
person
or fortune
of Belinda,
besides
he was near ten years older
than
Miss
Dormer, and therefore there was no
fear of an attachment taking place between
them.
But Horton was an artful ambitious man, he
long had
wished
to enjoy the benefits of an
independent
fortune, and looked on Belinda as
the
person
by
whose
assistance
he could obtain
so
desirable
an
acquisition
. He had always been
successful
with the ladies, but the true
state
of
his finances being generally known, he found it
impossible
to
succeed
in any matrimonial
scheme
,
except it was with the innocent and
unsuspicious
,
and Belinda was exactly
suited
for his
purpose
.
He flattered,
swore
, knelt, wept, and acted every
extravagance, till the
simple
girl made
some
confessions
in his favor, he then prevailed on
her to keep her partiality a
secret
from her
mother
,
for he knew that her parents
designed
her
for the bride of a young nobleman, who was at
at that time abroad. He expatiated on the folly
and cruelty of parents
choosing
partners for
their children, and launched out in
praise
of
disinterested
love, talked of the union of
souls
, and a
deal of
soft
sentimental
nonsense
, about a life of
uninterruped felicity with the object of her own
choice, though
she
was to live in the
meanest
cottage.
When Belinda returned to
school
,
she
fancied
herself
as much in love as it was
possible
for any
sentimental
heroine to be, and declared, for her
sweet
Horton
she
would be content to
relinquish
all the elegancies and indulgencies to which
she
had ever been
accustomed
, and live upon the
coarsest
viands, in an
obscure
mansion
. It was
in vain I endeavoured to argue my young friend
out of
these
ridiculous notions,
she
remained
fixed in her determination, to marry Horton or
not marry at all.
Unfortunately for Belinda, at that time I had
as chimerical ideas of
friendship
as
she
had of
love, and
should
have
supposed
it an
inexcusable
breach of confidence, to
discover
her
designs
to her mother, though it would have been
the
best
proof of real
friendship
I could
possibly
have given her.
She was taken from
school
with a
design
of being introduced to Lord Gaymore;
she
went home one day, had a meeting with
Horton
the next, and the third morning by five
o'clock
set
off in a
chaise
and four to Scotland,
without having even
seen
the
person
her parents
so
earnestly
wished
her to be united with.
When they returned, Mr. Dormer, though
highly offended at the
rash
conduct of Belinda,
and the black ingratitude of Horton, forgave
them, and
settled
an
handsome
annuity on her,
but told them the bulk of his fortune was
entailed
on Lord Gaymore, (who was the
nearest
male relation) in
case
of her
refusal
of him.
Belinda was
soon
settled
, and I took an early
opportunity to
visit
her; I found her, according
to her own words,
superlatively
happy! her
E
Horton was the
kindest
best
of
husbands
, her
home was a
paradise
,
she
would not be Lady
Gaymore for the world! What was affluence?
Nothing when put in competition with love and
Horton. But this was the language of
romance
.
I called on her again in about
six
months. I
found her
sitting
in extreme
dishabille
, her face
was pale, her eyes
sunk
, and as
she
pensively
leaned her head upon her hand, a tear now and
then
stole
down her cheek. I
asked
tenderly the
cause
of her
sorrow
. Oh! my friend,
said
she
, I have undone
myself
! Horton is no
longer the attentive tender
husband
. I,
smiling
,
told her, that
she
must
not expect the
solicitude
of
the lover to
last
for life, but be content with the
more calm and
lasting
esteem
of a friend.
Alas! replied Belinda, I have no friend,
I find, too late, my violent attachment to
Horton
was the romantic whim of a lively
imagination
;
and that the union of
souls
, the
similarity
of
sentiment
, which I had vainly thought would
make the
setters
of Hymen
easy
, and even
delightful
,
existed
only in my ideas. Horton has
neither
sense
, good nature, or
politeness
at home,
though he appears to
possess
those
amiable
qualities
so
eminently abroad. He is extravagant,
vain, and too
sond
of his own
person
, to be long
attached to any woman, except his
passion
is
excited by
interested
motives; he has not
scrupled
to own, it was the hope of
possessing
my
fortune
alone induced him to
address
me, and that
had he known the
estate
was entailed on Lord
Gaymore, he never would have troubled
himself
to make love to a puny, baby-faced girl, when
there were
so
many fine women who would have
thought
themselves
honoured by his notice.
Indeed
,
continued
she
, redoubling her tears, he
seldom
comes home but I am
insulted
with a
recital
of the many women of
fashion
who make
him advances, and I am debarred of every
innocent
amusement
,
stinted
in my
dress
, and
almost
kept without pocket-money, that he may appear
with elegance in company, and have plenty of
money to
lavish
in
expensive
pleasures
.
I was greatly chagrined to find my dear young
friend had really
such
just
cause
for complaint,
but endeavoured to comfort her, and lead her to
hope, that by
constant
affection, attention, and
good-humour,
she
might recal her wanderer, and
awaken in his
bosom
reciprocal
tenderness
. But
I found by her reply,
these
were fallacious
hopes.
She had been to
visit
her parents, and had
there formed an acquaintance with Lord
Gaymore
.
Unfortunately the ill-fated Belinda
discovered
E 2
this once dreaded nobleman to be
possessed
of every real virtue, of which Horton had
assumed
the
semblance
; his
person
was
handsome
,
without being effeminate, his heart glowed
with humanity and benevolence; he was a man
of refined
sense
and
strict
honor, with a mind
enlightened and expanded by a liberal education
and a thorough knowledge of the world. Belinda
saw
him, and acknowledged the full value of the
happiness
she
had voluntarily
cast
from her.
I warned her
against
making
comparisons
to
the
disparagement
of her
husband
; and hinted
the folly and danger of
suffering
any other
person
to
stand
higher in her
esteem
. She
acknowledged
the truth of my remarks,
said
she
would
endeavour
to be patient and content, but
she
greatly
feared
she
had
lost
sight
of
happiness
for ever.
And
so
indeed it proved, for though at the death
of her father
she
received a very
handsome
legacy,
so
great was Horton's extravagance that it was
presently
gone,
lavished
away on the
worst
of
women
for the
most
infamous
purposes
.
Belinda had children very
fast
, and before
she
was thirty years old was left a widow with eight
helpless
children, to
struggle
with the accumulated
evils of poverty, contempt, and a broken heart---
Horton's extravagance having obliged her to
sell
her annuity,
she
had no
resource
but to accept a
small
yearly allowance from Lord Gaymore,
who was then married, and allowed her a hundred
pounds a year, for the education of her
eldest
boy,
to whom he was god-father.
I will leave you my dear girls to imagine the
pain and mortification of
such
a dependence, and
while you pity Belinda's misfortune,
cautiously
avoid her errors! I
shall
renew the
subject
next
post
, till when and ever believe me your friend,
MENTORIA.
LETTER IV.
As
my
subject
is love, my dear children may
perhaps for once think an old woman
entertaining
;
but when they find my intention is only
to
expose
the dangers which are attendant on that
passion
,
instead
of following the example of more
juvenile
scribblers
, by expatiating on its
pleasures
,
you will throw down my letter in a pet.
But I
shall
not let this deter me from following
my intended plan, and endeavouring to convince
you that there cannot be a more critical period in
the whole
course
of your lives, than that in which
you are
surrounded
by lovers; nor can there be
any thing of more dangerous tendency than a
young woman
suffering
a lover to approach her
E 3
in a
clandestine
manner, or encourage
addresses
which
she
has any
reason
to think her parents or
friends would
disapprove
;
such
a conduct is
generally
attended with
disagreeable
consequences
.
I have a collection of letters in my
possession
,
which I think might well be termed a
school
for lovers, and will, I am certain, be of more
effect
in convincing you of the impropriety of
clandestine
marriages, than a whole
sheet
of dull
precepts. I have
sent
them for your
perusal
, and
by way of preface,
shall
give you an account of
the means by which I became
possessed
of them.
A favourite
servant
of your grand-mother's who
had been my
nurse
, had married a reputable
tradesman
, but, through unavoidable misfortunes,
they were reduced, and the
husband
thrown into
prison
. Martha lived in an
obscure
lodging, and
had been for
some
months extremely ill. My
lady encouraged me in going to
see
her, and
carrying
her little
presents
.
One day my lady was gone out to dinner, the
servants
were all in the kitchen, and I took that
opportunity of going out
unobserved
to
visit
Martha
.
Charmed with the idea of going by
myself
(for I
usually
had a
servant
with me) I tripped
nimbly along, in my way laying out my whole
stock
of pocket money, which amounted to five
shillings
, in tea,
sugar
and
biscuits
, for my
nurse
.
As I went up
stairs
to Martha's apartment, I
observed
in a
small
back room, the door of which
was taken off the hinges, a tall well-made man,
in an old
rusty
black coat, his face pale and
meagre, his arms folded upon his
bosom
, his eyes
fixed
seemingly
on the floor, but
instead
of the
vacant inanimate
stare
, there was a mixture of
horror
and
despair
depicted in them.
Curiosity
prompted me to draw near the door of the room;
at the farther end, on a bundle of
straw
, the only
furniture the wretched apartment afforded,
sat
a
woman,
whose
features told
she
had once been
lovely; on her lap lay an infant
asleep
,
beside
her
sat
a fine boy, who, with a piteous accent was
asking
for bread; the woman paid no attention
to his entreaties, but with her eyes fixed on the
youngest
child, appeared like
misery
personified
.
Young as I was, I felt my heart greatly afflicted
at this
scene
, and running
hastily
up
stairs
into
Martha's room, unable to articulate a word, I
burst
into tears. Martha
astonished
at the agony
I was in, tenderly inquired the
cause
. I told her
what I had
seen
. Alas! my dear child,
said
she
,
those
people are in more
distress
than it
is
possible
for you to conceive; they have lodged
in this
house
about
six
weeks, in which time I am
certain they have had nothing to
support
themselves
and children but what they could
raise
from
the
sale
of a few cloaths; they are now a fortnight
in arrears for rent, and the inhuman landlord has
taken the door off the hinges, and the windows
out of the frames, to oblige them to quit the
apartment
.
Alas, poor
souls
, they have no means of
procuring another
shelter
from nocturnal dews,
when they
relinguish
this. I have not
seen
him
stir
out
these
two days
past
, and am apt to think in
that time they have had no food except a
slice
of
bread and meat which I gave the
eldest
child
yesterday
.
How at that moment did I regret my money
being
all
spent
, five
shillings
appeared to me a
fortune
,
which might
preserve
these
unfortunate
people
;
however, I had not even a
single
halfpenny,
nor could I bear the thought of taking from
Martha
any part of what I had given her. I
therefore
hastily
bade her good bye, and flew rather
than walked home, inquired for the
house
-keeper,
related the afflicting
situation
of the family, and
requested
the loan of half a guinea. The
house-keeper
was an unfeeling, mercenary woman,
she
never heard a tale of
distress
but
she
imagined it
fictitious, nor would
she
ever
bestow
any relief,
left the object relieved
should
be an
impostor
.
She
refused
my
request
. I then had
recourse
to
the
nursery
maid, but could borrow no more
than one
shilling
.
With this trifle I eagerly returned to the poor
sufferers
, entered the apartment, and under
pretence
of
kissing
the infant, dropped the
shilling
into the mother's lap. The exclamation which
broke from her, when
she
saw
the money,
convinced
me
she
was a foreigner; and the demeanour
of the man was
vastly
above the common rank
of people.
Unfortunately my Lady did not return from
her
visit
till after
supper
,
so
that I was not
permitted
to
set
up to
see
her; but though I retired to
bed I could not
sleep
, my mind had been too much
agitated, and the
starving
family had left
such
an
impression
on it, that the moment I
closed
my
eyes they were
present
to my imagination.
Early in the morning I
stole
to Lady Winworth's
chamber, told my little
story
, and on my knees
intreated
some
money to carry to them.
Her
Ladyship
, though from infancy
nursed
in
the lap of
case
and affluence, had an heart
overflowing
with
compassion
towards her
suffering
fellow-creatures
;
she
gave me two guineas, and
ordered
the footman immediately to attend me.
I cannot
describe
the joy that expanded my
heart as I proceeded to GStreet. The
master
of the
house
was
just
risen
, and was
opening
his
shop
. I
asked
for the foreign gentleman.
Gentleman
, returned he with a
sneer
, the French
beggar I
suppose
you mean, I don't know where
he is, I turned them out
last
night; people who
cannot afford to pay for their lodgings,
must
lay where and how they can. Cruel inhuman
wretch,
said
I, and turned from him with every
mark of abhorrence.
It was yet early, the morning was inviting,
and I thought a walk in the fields might cheer
me after my recent
disappointment
; however, I
previously
determined every inquiry
should
be
made after the poor foreigner and his family.
Crossing
a field in the vicinity of
Mary-lebon
,
the voice of a child crying caught my ear, I
turned my head, and
saw
at a little
distance
,
seated
on a log of wood, the very
person
I had been
seeking
, one child was in his arms, the other
stood
by him, his wife lay on the ground. I ran
to him,
spoke
to him, bade him take hope, and
put the two guineas in his handhe looked at
the money, then at me. Angel of mercy,
said
he,
with a deep
sigh
, it is too late, my Agnes has
left me. I
saw
his intellects were
disordered
and
shuddered
with horror. Thinking the wife
would be better able to take care of the money,
I
stooped
in order to awaken her---I called her,
she
moved not---I took hold of her hand, it was
dreadfully cold;
she
is in a fit,
said
I, and
raised
her head upon my knee. Never, oh! never,
my beloved girls, will the
spectacle
that
presented
itself
to my eyes, be
banished
from my memory.
Her eyes were partly
closed
, her mouth half
open, her lips black---Death had that night
released
her from a world of
misery
. I
shrieked
and fainted. When I recovered I found
myself
in my dear Lady's arms, who told me, the body
of the poor young woman was taken care of,
that the man was quite
distracted
and entirely
unable
to give any account of
himself
, though from
an
unfinished
letter,
addressed
to the
Marchioness
Savillion, which was found in the woman's pocket
they had
reason
to
suppose
they were of a good
family.
The man
survived
his wife but a few days,
my Lady took care of the children.
About
six
months after I was
sent
to a convent
near Paris, in order to
finish
my education, and
perfect
myself
in the French language. Among
a number of boarders who
resided
at the convent,
I was particularly noticed by one, who was
distinguished
by the title of St.
Augustina
;
she
was of a weakly
constitution
, and often confined
to her bed, when
she
was always
pleased
if I
would work or read
beside
her. One day
she
gave me her keys, and
desired
me to unlock a
cabinet and take out a curious piece of
needle-work
which
she
said
had been executed by a once
loved friend. As I took the work from the
drawer, a miniature picture attracted my notice;
methought I knew the features; I took it up to
examine it more minutely, and immediately
recollected
the
interesting
countenance of the
unfortunate
Agnes. Upon inquiry I found I was
right in my conjecture; St.
Augustina
was the
Marchioness
Savillion, whom Lady Winworth
had made numerous
fruitless
inquiries after. She
had been the friend and companion of Agnes,
but had married and left the convent where they
both boarded
just
before that young lady, and
her
last
pathetic letters never reached her till it
was too late to
administer
relief; the
Marchioness
had
since
lost
her
husband
and two fine
children, by fire, which accident had
so
impaired
her health and
depressed
her
spirits
, that
she
had
retired from the world, and meant to
spend
the
remainder of her days in the convent where
she
had
passed
her youth. She
shewed
me all
Agnes's
letters, and before I left France
suffered
me
to take copies of them.
LETTER I.
AGNES TO THE MARCHIONESS.
`
Why
have you left me, my
Augustina
, why
are you away at the moment I
most
want
your advice?
Selfish
Agnes, methinks I hear
you
say
, to regret the
happiness
of your friend,
because
it interferes with your own. Oh! no,
I do not regret your felicity, my
sweet
friend,
I rejoice, I exult in the reflection that you are
for ever exempt from the pangs which at
present
rive the heart of the wretched Agnes.
You ever knew the
aversion
and horror that
seized
my heart when I reflected on the intended
union between
myself
and the Count de la Rue.
Alas! my
Augustina
, the time approaches when
that
aversion
will become a crime, and yet I
feel it every day
increase
. Shall I own to the
sympathizing
bosom
of
friendship
, that my heart
has made its election, and that election has not
fallen on the man for whom my parents have
designed
me. I know you will blame me, I know
you will bid me endeavour to conquer my
growing
passion
, and call in
reason
to my
assistance
.
Alas! what power has
reason
over the heart
torn by contending
passions
? Duty bids me
stifle
my
sighs
, and bend my thoughts and
wishes
towards
the Count, love triumphs over duty, and I
can only think of Vieurville.
The day after you left our convent,
Madamoiselle
Vieurville
requested
me to attend her to the
parlour, where her brother and lover waited to
see
her. You
must
go, Agnes,
said
she
, or
my brother will be quite at a
loss
how to
amuse
F
himself
, while I
converse
with
Montrose
. I was
easily
persuaded
, and on entering the parlour,
was
struck
with the noble mein and elegant
manner
of young Vieurville; we chatted for
some
time
on indifferent
subjects
, his vivacity and wit,
(through which it was
easy
to
discover
a fund of
good
sense
) delighted me, and when I retired with
Mademoiselle
, I could not help
expressing
my
admiration
;
he is a charming young man indeed,
said
she
, and had I not known that you were on
the point of marriage, I
should
not have ventured
to introduce him to you, for fear you might
lose
your heart; for you
must
know (continued
she
,
paying no regard to the
visible
emotion which I
am certain agitated my features) that Louis is to
be married the
same
day that I am, to a beautiful
Spanish
lady, who is expected in Paris next
month. Has he ever
seen
his intended bride
said
I, affecting indifference. Oh! no,
she
replied
,
but if Donna Clara be but half as lovely as
her picture
represents
her, he
must
inevitably fall
in love. It is odd,
said
I, that he
should
consent
to marry a woman he has never
seen
. I dare
say
it appears
so
to you, replied
Mademoiselle
, but
when I
shall
tell you how it came about, your
wonder will
cease
.
My mother was the only daughter of an ancient
wealthy
Spanish
family, and eloped with my
father
from a convent, where
she
was placed for
education. The match was very unequal; her
father was irreconcilably offended, and would
never
suffer
her to be named in his
presence
.
My mother was tenderly beloved by her
brother
,
who, at the old nobleman's
decease
, paid her
a
handsome
fortune, and vowed their families
should
ever live in the
strictest
amity.
My uncle was married to a woman of whom he
was
passionately
fond, and when, in giving birth
to Donna Clara,
she
departed this world, he took
a
solemn
oath that no other woman
should
ever
supply
her place, but that the whole of his future
life
should
be devoted to the care of his daughter.
My mother at that time lying in of a
son
, the two
infants were contracted to each other, and my
brother, at his uncle's
decease
, is to inherit the
estate
and titles devolving to him from his
grandfather
.
My uncle is expected to bring his
daughter
to Paris this winter, when the marriage is to
be completed, and I
shall
be delivered from this
horrid convent.
I cannot
describe
my feelings during
Mademoiselle's
recital. I know not what could be the
cause
of my agitation, but I could hardly
restrain
my tears, while I remained in her apartment.
When I retired, I began to take my heart to talk,
F 2
and determined to repel a
rising
passion
, which
had thus
suddenly
taken
possession
of it. I
uddenly">suddenly
taken
possession
of it. I
forbore
making any
comparison
between my
intended
Lord and young Vieurville, and determined
never to
see
the latter again; but the next
morning
vanquished
these
good
resolutions
.
I was but
just
arisen
, when one of the lay-
sisters
informed me a gentleman
requested
a few
moments
conversation
. Imagining it to be either
the Count, or
some
messenger
from my father,
I repaired without
hesitation
to the parlour. Judge
of my
surprise
when I found
myself
in the
presence
of
Monsieur
Vieurville.
Supposing
the nun had
made a
mistake
in calling me
instead
of
Mademoiselle
,
his
sister
, I was going to retire, when
he intreated me to
stop
,
assured
me there was no
mistake
, and taking my hand, led me to a chair,
and
seated
himself
beside
me.
I come,
dearest
Madam,
said
he, to entreat
a few moments
serious
attention from you, and
a candid
answer
to a
question
, which though
abrupt in its nature, yet from the
circumstances
which we both at
present
are in, demands an
explicit
reply. My
sister
has informed me, that
your parents
design
you for the wife of Count de
la Rue; however
presumptuous
the
supposition
may be, I cannot imagine your heart has any
interest
in the intended union. My heart, Sir,
replied I, will ever follow the dictates of duty,
and rejoice in ratifying any engagement which
I am certain will give my parents
so
much
pleasure
.
But was that heart left to make its free choice,
would it then have
selected
the Count as the
object
of its
dearest
affection?
I know not,
Monsieur
, what authority you have
to make
these
enquiries, nor do I think
myself
obliged to
answer
them.
I
rose
to quit the parlour---lovely Agnes,
said
he, catching my hand, I know I have been
abrupt
,
but let my
situation
plead my
excuse
. You
no doubt have heard from my
sister
, that I am
designed
the
husband
of a woman I have never
seen
; till
yesterday
I ever believed my heart
unsusceptible
of the power of beauty, and imagined
I might be as happy with Donna Clara as any
other woman, but I am now convinced, that
indifference
only proceeded from the want of a proper
object to call forth the affections of my heart. I
have
seen
the lovely object who has that power,
I feel my
bosom
glow with new and unutterable
sensations
,
and though I would have married Clara
had I continued in a
state
of indifference; I will
never wed her now, my heart is firmly attached
to another. You, adorable Agnes, are the only
F 3
woman who ever gave my heart a
single
pain, or
taught it to throb with rapture; if your affections
are already engaged, I will condemn
myself
to
eternal
silence
, but if you will grant me one ray
of hope that you are not altogether indifferent to
my
suit
, the world
shall
not tempt me to enter
into any engagement with Donna Clara.
Oh! my beloved
Augustina
, at that moment
reason
, honour, fortitude,
forsook
me, enchanted
with the convincing proof he offered to give me
of inviolable attachment, I
suffered
him to
perceive
my partiality. I thought not on the
irreparable
injury I
should
do Vieurville's family, I
forgot
the duty I owed my parents, the
respect
I
owed
myself
, and
confessed
that he alone was the
master
of my affections.
I
see
your anger, my dear friend, I hear you
blame my imprudence;
shall
I
lose
your
friendship
,
Augustina
, will you
chase
the imprudent
Agnes from your
bosom
! Alas! If you do, where
will
she
find another
resting
place? The thought
overpowers me, I can write no more.
Adieu,
AGNES.
LETTER II.
From the same to the same.
I acknowledge
your reproof, I
see
my
error, but I have not power to renounce it.
You bid me exert my fortitude; I have no
fortitude
,
my friend, it all
forsook
me when I was
parted from
Augustina
, what little I ever
possessed
was but a gentle
spark
of virtue caught from her
bosom
. I am nothing of
myself
, a
seather
, an
atom of
thistledown
is heavy when weighed
against
the
stability
of Agnes. Donna Clara is
arrived
,
and Vieurville has
refused
to fulfil the
engagements his father had entered into; his
sister
suspects
the
cause
, I have
lost
her
friendship
, I
have endured her reproaches; yes, my friend
Agnes de Romani has
subjected
herself
to
reproach
,
and
conscious
that
she
deserved
it,
received
it in
passive
silence
, nor dared to vent her
full heart in aught but tears. Oh!
Augustina
,
how am I fallen! I have this morning
received a
summons
to return home;
to-morrow
I leave the convent, to-morrow I bid adieu
to Vieurville. I am expected to receive the
hand of the Count---'tis a vain hope, I am
determined
to
refuse
him---I cannot be the wife of
Vieurville, I will never be the wife of another---
my grave would be a welcomer bridal bed, than
to
share
a diadem with De la Rue.
Augustina
, pity
me, but do not hate me.
AGNES.
LETTER III.
I have
refused
him. I have borne a
father's
anger, a mother's tears, but
still
continue
resolute
. Alas!
Augustina
, how
easy
is
it to
assume
courage and fortitude when the
heart is
interested
. Methinks for Vieurville I
could bear, without complaining, the
heaviest
ills to which human nature is
subject
.
My father has
just
left me, he has offered
the Count my younger
sister
Theodora, he has
accepted her, and I am to take the veil, and
give up my fortune in return for this
condescension
,
I have
consented
with alacrity. Oh
Vieurville
,
what a
sacrifice
I make for you.
To-morrow
I return to the convent, and enter on my
novitiate.
Augustina
, pity me, pray for me,
and, if you can forget her errors,
still
love your
AGNES.
LETTER IV.
Eight
months of my novitiate is
past
, and
I have never heard of Vieurville. But what
is Vieurville to me? Am I not going to
renounce
the world and all its
pleasures
; am I not
going to devote my future life to my maker?
Augustina
, are not my thoughts free, and
though my body is immured within the walls of a
cloister
, may not my fancy wander, free as air,
to Vieurville. Oh! the tortures of
suspence
!
Could I but know where he was, could I but be
satisfied
he
still
remembers Agnes, methinks I
could be content. Write to me, my friend,
endeavour
to calm my mind; tell me,
Augustina
,
when I have thrown off the trappings which
mark a child of vanity, will not
sweet
peace
inhabit
my
bosom
, when
simplicity
has attired my
person
? And when the irrevocable vow has
past
my lips, will not my perturbed
spirits
be
hushed
to
rest
, and all my
soul
be rapt in religious
harmony
.
Oh! no, no, my
sweet
friend, the
massy
doors that
close
on us poor captives, cannot
shut
out the
busy
meddling
passions
, or
stifle
the
feelings
we receive from nature. The
simplicity
of
our habit is not an index of the purity of our
mind, nor is the kneeling
posture
, or lifted eye,
true indications of the fervor of religion!
Augustina
,
hypocrisy
may dwell in a convent,
so
may love, hatred,
jealousy
, and
despair
. And is
an heart agitated by
these
contending
passions
, a
sit
sacrifice
to be offered at the throne of grace?
Will not your Agnes be the
worst
of hypocrites,
to vow eternal love and faith to her Maker,
when her whole
soul
is
absorbed
in a
passion
for a frail mortal!
I know I
distress
you, my friend, Oh!
pardon
the wretched Agnes, if with her
complaining
she
sometimes
dashes
with bitter the cup
which overflows with
blessings
; if you
refuse
to hear my complaints, where
shall
the unhappy
Agnes
seek
for
compassion
hadst
thou never
left me I
should
not have been the wretch I
am.
Adieu. May every
blessing
heaven can
bestow
,
or you
desire
, be your portion, prays the
lost
AGNES.
LETTER V.
Augustina
, you will tremble when you
receive this, you will think it a
meritorious
act to drive from your heart the remembrance
of Agnes de Romani; but if thou
hast
any
remaining
gleam of
compassion
in thy gentle
bosom
,
oh give it way, renounce not thy unhappy friend,
but chear her with one forgiving line.
I have
seen
Vieurville, I have forfeited my
vows, left the convent, and become a fugitive
and an exile, my brain is diftracted when I think
what I have
suffered
this
last
fourteen days, nor
can all my
husband
's
tenderness
soothe
me. My
pulse
throbs, my veins are
scorched
with heat---
I
must
throw
aside
my pen, my eyes are dim.
Augustina
, thy dying friend lifts up her
soul
in
prayers for thy
happiness
.
After three weeks being confined to my bed,
I am at length permitted to
address
the
compassionate
friend of my youth.
Raised
from the
confines of the grave, I once more pour forth my
soul
into the
bosom
of
Augustina
. I will now
attempt
to give you
some
regular account of the
proceedings of
last
month. Alas! my friend,
my heart will bleed
afresh
as I trace the painful
scenes
, painful they will ever be to my
remembrance
,
for I have drawn inevitable ruin on the
man my
soul
doated on.
As I had never heard any tidings of
Vieurville
,
from the time I was taken from the convent,
with a
design
of being married to the Count, till
within three days of the time when my novitiate
was expired, I began to look on my
profession
as
inevitable, and endeavoured to bring
myself
to
think of it with
calmness
, but
still
corroding
thoughts would
sometimes
intrude, and overturn
my
best
resolutions
. My only
wish
was to hear
whether Vieurville was alive or dead, or
whether
he was married to my rival; but
these
were
particulars I was never able to
discover
, as his
father and family had quitted Paris
soon
after my
return to the convent.
There remained but three days now before I
was to take the veil, and I endeavoured to forfity
my mind
against
the awful day, with every
argument
reason
or religion could
supply
. I was
busy
in reflecting on the change a few
short
hours
would make, when one of our boarders
asked
me
to accompany her to the grate; I complied, and
we
amused
ourselves
sometime
in chatting to two
English
ladies, who were in the parlour; the
ladies were
just
preparing to leave the convent,
when a violent ringing at the gate alarmed us;
the
portress
ran to open it, and in a moment
Vieurville
rushed
into the parlour. I know not
what I
said
or whether I
spoke
at all---a
sudden
mist
obscured
my
sight
and I fell to the ground;
when I recovered, my friend, the boarder, told
me, that
seeing
the
impetuosity
of my lover,
she
had
advised
him to leave the convent, and if he
had any thing particular to communicate, to do
it by letter, and
inclose
it to her. Her friendly
soothing
greatly contributed to calm my
spirits
,
and as none of the
sisterhood
had
seen
Vieurville,
they all remained ignorant of the interview.
In about three hours I received a letter, in
which he told me, nothing but
absolute
force
should
so
long have kept him from me; that he
had been detained in Spain by various
stratagems
,
but having at
last
eluded the vigilance of his
guards, he hurried to Paris, where he
presently
learnt the
sacrifice
I was about to make, he urged
my leaving the convent and being united to him
by the
most
indissoluble
bonds; and
said
, he
made no doubt but my father would be
easily
led to forgive us. I
shewed
the letter to my
young friend,
she
joined the
persuasions
of
Vieruville
,
and
said
she
would undertake to manage
my
escape
on the very morning on which I was
to become
profest
.
I wrote to my dear Vieurville, and my friend
enclosed
it in one from
herself
, directing him in
what manner to proceed. That very evening
Edella, (which was the name of my friend) was
seized
with a violent
indisposition
, which would
have made a dupe of even me, had I not been in
the
secret
. She continued ill all night, and the
next day when
she
desired
the
abbess
to
send
to a
relation
she
had about
seven
miles from Paris,
requesting
she
would
send
her coach for her the
G
ensuing
morning at eleven o'clock, as
she
thought
a few days
spent
in the country, would be of
infinite
service
to her. Vieurville was ordered to
send
a carriage at nine, and it being the
last
morning
of my novitiate, I
desired
not be
disturbed
till
it was time for me to enter the chapel. This
request
I knew would be complied with, as it
would be
supposed
, I
wished
for time for
meditation
.
Accordingly I early left my cell, and
going
to Edella's apartment,
dressed
myself
in
some
of her cloaths, and put on a long black hood
which would pull over the face; thus attired, I
waited
anxiously
for a ring at the gate and
guessing
it was the coach, hurried down
stairs
,
and
so
prevented the
portress
from coming up to
call Edella. I met
several
of the nuns as I
passed
from her apartment to the door, but they neither
spoke
to me, nor attempted to
stop
me. I got out of
the convent
unsuspected
, and in
less
than an hour
was in a place of
safety
, where a
priest
immediately
united me to my dear Vieurville. My
first
desire
was that we
should
fly to my father for his
protection, intreat his pardon and
blessing
, and
through his
intercession
be again received into the
church, from whence I was certain we
should
be
excommunicated. It was midnight when I
arrived
at my father's, he had been returned from
Paris
near four hours, whither he had rapaired to
see
me take the veil, and was then, overcome
with fatigue and
disappointment
,
just
retired to
rest
. I would not permit the
servant
to inform
his
master
that I was come home, but following
him up
stairs
, threw
myself
on my knees by his
bed-
side
. He
started
at
seeing
me, fury
flashed
from his eyes, and
grasping
my hand with
violence
,
he cried, Agnes, ungrateful girl, why are
you here? With tremulous accents, I in a few
words told him I was married, and intreated his
pardon and
friendship
.
Oh! never
shall
I forget his
answer
, 'twas
awful
,
'twas more than nature could
support
. He
spurned
me from him, he
cursed
me, and
imprecated
the wrath of heaven on his head if ever he
forgave me. I will not,
said
he, precipitate
your impending fate, by betraying you to the
ecclesiastical
powers; go
hasten
to leave France,
and if you can be happy
oppressed
by the weight
of a father's
curse
, may you be
so
!---Hence,
begone, you offend my
sight
.
Vieurville forced me out of the room. During
the time of my petitioning for pardon, my mother
had
arose
,
she
followed me down
stairs
,
blessed
me, and
promised
to
use
her
interest
with my
father
,
to effect a reconciliation. She gave me all
the
cash
the
possessed
and
some
jewels that had
been
presented
me by a relation. When I
embraced
her for the
last
time, it
seemed
like
rending
soul
and body
asunder
; but hope, that
sweet
G 2
soother
of the human mind, bore me up, and
I flattered
myself
we
should
one day meet again.
When we left my father's
house
, we
set
forward
immediately for Calais, and from thence
embarked for Dover, where, overcome by
agitation
and fatigue, I was
seized
with a fever which
brought me to the verge of the grave. During
my
illness
Vieurville wrote to his father, and we
now
anxiously
await the arrival of an
answer
. Oh!
may it be propitious, but my
sad
heart
presages
I
shall
never more know
happiness
: For
myself
,
I could have borne it patiently, but when I
think I have involved my dear Vieurville in
misery
,
my brain
sickens
and
almost
madness
ensues
.
My
dearest
Augustina
, if you do not
resolve
to
hate me, by one kind line convey
some
gleam of
comfort to the agonizing heart of
AGNES.
LETTER VI.
When
will my portion of
misery
be full,
when
shall
I
say
there is no more to
suffer
.
When I am laid in the silent grave, when
my eyes
close
on this world and open to
immortality
,
then
Augustina
may
say
, Agnes is at
peace!
Though I have not received a line from your
once friendly hand, I
still
think you have not
forgotten me, and having no other prop
whereon
to lean, I
still
pour forth my
sorrows
to you.
My mother, my only friend, is torn from me,
and I have the additional
misery
of thinking my
disobedience
precipitated her end;
she
drooped
from the day I
lest
France, and her confidential
servant
informed me, her
last
breath was
spent
in intreating my father to pardon me, but he was
inexorable.
Vieurville has received an
answer
from his
father; but, oh! my
Augustina
, what killing
lines did it contain. Donna Clara had conceived
a
passion
for her
cousin
, and from the time of his
leaving Spain, fell into a profound melancholy,
and when
she
heard of his marriage, the
agitation
of her
spirits
became too much for her weak
frame to
support
, and a rapid decline carried
her an early victim to the grave. Vieurville is
disinherited
,
disowned
, and loaded with a
father's
anger; but will you believe it, my friend,
he
still
loves the woman who has brought
those
misfortunes upon him; but that love, that warm
mutual affection that
subsists
between us
serves
only to heighten our
misery
---for oh! what
torture
can compare to that of
seeing
the object we
love overwhelmed with
distress
we have not the
power to mitigate?
G 3
I am a mother,
Augustina
, but far from
feeling
transport
when
clasping
my infant to my
heart, methinks his innocent eyes reproach me
with bringing him into the world, when his only
birth-right is
wretchedness
. Poverty, with
haggard
countenance, and famine, with cold
griping
hand, have taken up their abode in our
dwelling
.
Must
I write it,
must
the daughter of
de Romani tell her friend,
she
is in want of
almost
the common
necessaries
of life!----Oh!
bitter reflection, hard, hard
task
, Agnes
must
solicit
charity of her friend
Augustina
!----And,
alas! my friend,
unless
relief comes
soon
, we
must
perish
! for in this
strange
land what can
we do? We cannot work, and (
notwithstanding
the known humanity of the
British
nation)
we are
ashamed
to beg.
Oh! how blind are the dictates of
passion
!
how erroneous are its judgments! may none of
my
sex
henceforth
listen
to its
delusive
arguments
,
but by adhering to the precepts of
reason
,
avoid the
miseries
of
AGNES.
LETTER VII.
If
ever this reaches the hand of my
ever-loved
Augustina
Savillion, enquire for my
children, and be to them a mother; intreat the
Marquis to take them under his protection, for
a few
short
days will render them orphans. We
have
passed
from one degree of
wretchedness
to
another, till a bundle of
straw
, a dry
crust
, and
a few rags that cover our emaciated frames, are
the whole of our worldly
possessions
, and to
encrease
my affliction, fix weeks
since
I brought
into the world another child of
sorrow
.
Gracious heaven! could words convey to my
Augustina
the extent of my
misery
, could
she
but for a moment, even in idea, experience my
sufferings
;but may the beneficent power that
rules the world avert from her even the
shadow
of
such
afflictions, may my
bitterest
enemy
never
experience the pangs that at
present
harrow
up my
soul
.
I am a mother, I hear the darling of my
heart, the child of my
bosom
asking
for food,
and have it not to give him. I am a wife, and
see
my adored, my
almost
idolized
husband
,
sinking
under the complicated evils of
samine
,
grief and
sickness
, yet have neither comfort or
consolations
to offer. Let the wife, the mother,
judge of my tortures, they are agonies that may
be felt, but cannot be
described
.
Augustina
, this is the
last
time I
shall
ever
address
you; this night the wretched Agnes
must
lay her head upon the earth, with no
canopy
but the
skies
. Oh! my children, Oh!
my beloved Vieurville, thy mother, thy wife
has murdered thee.
Adieu. If thou
hast
any children, tell them
my
story
, and teach them to
subdue
their
passions
.
We are incompetent judges of what will
promote our own
happiness
. Oh! that I had
never---
Here the unfortunate Agnes breaks off, this
was the letter found in her pocket, and in all
probability was written the day before her
death.
To attempt a comment on this
story
would be
an
insult
to your
understandings
; I
shall
therefore
leave you to make your own reflections, and
wishing
you every
happiness
, throw
aside
my
pen. Adieu, I need not tell you how much I
am your friend,
MENTORIA.
The author cannot help here remarking, that as this
story
is
authentic and not the offspring of fancy,
she
hopes it will make a
lasting
impreshon
on the minds of her fair readers,
MARIAN AND LYDIA.
PART I.
She
sets
like
stars
that fall to
rise
no more.
The
sun
was
sunk
beneath the
western
hills,
his parting beams made the horizon flame
with
burnished
gold, and darted on the
topmost
branches of the lofty trees of a neighbouring
forest
.
Autumn had not put off her
pleasing
robe, nor had the gentle zephyr
forsook
the
plain to give place to his rude-brother Boreas.
The ground was
strewed
with leaves of various
hues; the ripened fruit hung on the bending
trees, and fields of waving golden grain
rendered
the
scene
delightful.
Marian and Lydia having
finished
their daily
talk,
set
aside
their wheels with alacrity, and
tying on their
straw
bonnets, prepared to enjoy
the beauties of the evening, by rambling over
the adjacent fields and meadows.
They were innocent and
sprightly
as the
young
sawn
that lightly bounds over the verdant
lawn;
smiling
youth and
rosy
health glowed
upon their cheeks, and
sparkled
in their eyes;
their
wishes
untaught by art or luxury to
stray
beyond the bounds which
simple
nature has
marked out, were
easily
supplied
; they
arose
each morn with the feathered
choristers
, and
chearfully
pursued
their daily labour; the
evening
was their time for mirth. Innocence
presided
over all their
pleasures
, and meek-eyed
content on downy pinions hovered over their
homely couch,
sweetening
their quiet
slumbers
.
Their cottage was
situated
in a
pleasant
valley
,
on the borders of Wales; it was plain and
rural, it contained every
necessary
, but no
superfluities
;
simplicity
had decorated it, and the
neatness
of its furniture rendered it more
pleasing
to the
rustic
inhabitants than the
most
sumptuous
palace.
Here Marian and Lydia, by their
chearfulness
and
industry
, enlivened the declining hours of
their mother Dorcas.
Beware,
said
the careful mother, beware, my
children, tarry not too long, left the evening
lamps
should
impair your health, and rob your
mother of her only comforts.
The
sisters
departed, and as they wandered
over the fields, in the innocent gaiety of their
hearts, carroled forth their
songs
in wild,
untutored
,
but melodious notes.
Sir George Lovemore had arrived a few days
before at Gwinfred-Hall, to
visit
a maiden aunt,
whose
unlimited fortune demanded this mark of
respect
, for the virtues of her mind, or the
sweetness
of her manner he was totally
unacquainted
with. Mrs. Gwinfred's unaffected
piety
,
good-humour, and amiable
disposition
, were
things totally
disregarded
by the young
libertine
,
though the
visit
was
professedly
made to
her, yet he
spent
but a
small
share
of his time
in her company. He was continually rambling
from one place to another, making
visits
to
those
neighbouring gentlemen
whose
opinions
and manners
most
suited
with his own. He
was this evening returning from a
visit
to the
Earl of Landaff, he was
seated
in an elegant
phaeton, drawn by four beautiful bays, his
servants
were in their
best
travelling liveries, which
were green faced with buff, and
superbly
trimmed
with gold lace, they proceeded
slowly
, the
animals
seeming
to partake of their
master
's
indolence
.
Marian and Lydia had wandered to the road,
and were
just
crossing
it with an intent to enter
a
small
wood on the other
side
, when this
magnificent
equipage impeded their way. They
had never before
seen
any thing half
so
grand
---they
stopped
involuntarily to admire it as it
passed
; the wind had blown off Marian's
bonnet
,
her luxuriant brown hair falling in
ringlets
over her face and neck,
served
as a
shade
to heighten but not
obscure
her charms.
Sir George caught a
glimpse
of her
person
,
and in her little white jacket,
simple
,
unadorned
,
she
appeared to him like a wood nymph;
her form was delicate, her
stature
rather below
the middling
size
. He alighted from his
phaeton
,
and offering his hand to Marian,
said
he
would
assist
her in
crossing
the road; he
seized
her unreluctant hand, he gazed
earnestly
upon
her face, and felt in a moment his heart was
captivated by this
rustic
fascinating
beauty; the
modest
inobtrusive
charms of Lydia were
unnoticed
,
he called her
sister
by a
thousand
divine
appellations, which, as they had never heard
them before, at once excited their wonder and
their fears.
Leave us, good Sir,
said
Lydia, for we
must
return home, and
should
our mother
see
you,
she
would be angry with us;
besides
, Sir, we
country maidens are not
used
to
converse
with
such
grand folks, and mayhap you will laugh
at our
simplicity
. They then dropped their
curtsies
, and
wishing
him a good night, would
have left him, but he
stopped
Marian, and
attempted
rudely to
salute
her;
she
shrieked
,
struggled
, and at length freeing
herself
from his
hold, caught her
sister
's hand, and darting
across
the field, they were
presently
out of
sight
.
Sir George gazed after them for a moment,
then,
ascending
his carriage, determined in his
own mind to attempt the
seduction
of Marian,
He made no doubt but
she
would again walk
the
same
way, and
resolved
every night to
ramble
out in hopes of meeting her.
The
sisters
slackened
not their pace till they
arrived within
sight
of their mother's cottage.
Dorcas,
uneasy
at their long
stay
, had walked
forth to meet them; their
haste
and
confusion
alarmed her. Tell me, my children,
said
she
,
why are you thus agitated? Has any thing
frightened you, or has any of the low-bred
clowns
insulted
you? Why would you walk
so
late?
Dear mother, cried Lydia, a gentleman
stopped
us, and was
so
rude to my
sister
.
Not very rude,
said
Marian, interrupting her,
he only wanted to
kiss
me, and I ran away from
him. But you cannot think what a fine
gentleman
H
he was,
so
handsome
, and he had
such
a pretty thing to ride in; dear, dear, how I
should
like to ride in
such
an one.
I am
surprised
, Marian,
said
Dorcas,
gravely
,
to hear you talk thus; it becomes not a girl
of your humble
station
to
speak
in
such
raptures
of the beauty of a gentleman, or the
grandeur of his equipage, much
less
to form
wishes
to be indulged by riding in it.
Why
surely
, dear mother,
said
she
, it is no
harm to
wish
.
It is wrong, my dear child (replied the
tender
mother) very wrong to form
wishes
which
we are certain, from the
situation
in which it
has
pleased
Providence to place us, can never
be laudably gratified. You know, Marian, 'tis
impossible
you can ever
possess
a
splendid
equipage
.
Oh! dear,
said
Marian, I do not think
so
;
mayhap the fine gentleman may be in love with
me; I am
sure
he called me by many pretty
names.
Dorcas
shook
her head, and
sighed
. And
how,
said
she
, looking mournfully at Marian,
how has vanity found entrance in a heart I had
hoped was the
seat
of innocence and content.
Don't be angry with my
sister
, dear mother,
said
Lydia, to be
sure
the gentleman did talk a
great deal about beauty and
goddesses
, but I
dare
say
he meant nothing.
That's nothing but envy,
said
Marian,
peevishly
,
because
he did not
say
any thing to you.
For of what
use
would it be to him to
say
I was
the
loveliest
girl he ever
saw
, if he did not
think
so
; that would be fibbing for fibbing's
sake
.
Dorcas
smiled
at her
simplicity
, while
she
regretted
that
those
sparks
of vanity which had
ever lain dormant, had by flattery been blown
into a flame. They entered the cottage, and
sat
down to a rural
supper
of milk and fruit;
during the
repast
Marian could think nor
speak
of aught
beside
the gentleman.
Lydia was
silent
, and Dorcas now and then
sighed
profoundly, while a tear fell as
she
reverted
in her thoughts to occurrences long
since
past
; when they had
finished
their temperate
meal,
she
thus
addressed
her daughters.
My dear children,
said
she
, you have often
heard me
say
, that you
lost
your father when
you were quite infants: in that I told you
truth; he is
lost
, irreparably
lost
to you and me,
but it was not death that tore him from us. I
H 2
have ever avoided mentioning any of the
occurrences
of my
past
life,
lest
it
should
pain your
gentle, affectionate hearts, but I find now the
hour is arrived when the mother's
sorrows
shall
serve
as a warning to the daughters, to teach
them to avoid
those
shoals
and
quicksands
on
which were wrecked her
happiness
and peace.
Listen
attentively, and while you weep over
my misfortunes, let the errors which brought
them on me
sink
deep in your hearts;
remember
they were the
cause
of your mother's ruin,
and
shun
them through the
course
of your own
lives as you would any
poisonous
or obnoxious
reptile.
THE HISTORY OF DORCAS.
PART II.
I was
the only daughter of a farmer in the
West
of England. He in his youth, by
integrity
and fidelity,
so
well recommended
himself
to the favour of the nobleman, of whom at
that time he rented a farm, that he made him
steward
of all his
estates
, which were
situated
in
that country.
I had the misfortune to
lose
my mother before
I had
seen
sixteen
years;
she
was a woman of
exemplary
piety,
she
had early inculcated in my
mind a love of religion and virtue, and taught me
that humility, charity, and chearful content were
the true marks of
christianity
.----Had I never
suffered
those
excellent precepts to depart from
my mind, I
should
never have experienced the
many
miseries
which have
since
marked my
unhappy
life.
During the life of this worthy parent I lived
extremely
retired,
she
superintended
my education
H 3
which was
such
as might render me a
useful
member
of
society
, but
she
bestowed
very little time
on the
shewy
accomplishments
which are
set
so
high a price on in the
present
age, and which,
though they are certainly
necessary
to
finish
the
education of a gentlewoman, are very immaterial
to
those
who expect to move but in the middle
sphere
.
After my mother's
decease
I took the entire
charge of my father's family upon me, did the
honours of his table, received and entertained all
his
visitants
, and made frequent
excursions
abroad;
I was
thoughtless
, vain, and giddy. I never
before
heard the voice of adulation, which now
assailed
my ears from
almost
every man with
whom I
conversed
. I
listened
to it eagerly, and
like my
simple
Marian placed an implicit faith in
all they
said
.
My heart was full of
sensibility
, and being
deprived of my mother, whom I had ever
considered
and loved as a friend, I began to look
round for
some
female object on whom to
settle
those
affectionate feelings, to whom I might
unbosom
all my little inquietudes,
consult
and
advise
with on trifling
embarassments
and vexations,
which at that time I
considered
as
serious
troubles.
Unfortunately for me, the Earl of S to
whom my father was
steward
, at that time came
into the country, and brought with him his
daughter
,
Lady Laura S and a young gentleman
whom I
shall
call Melfont, he was the
second
son
of a noble family, and though then only nineteen
years old, had obtained the rank of captain in the
army; his fortune was large, having inherited
his mother's jointure, but he had
chosen
the
profession
of arms, as he thought the character of a
good
soldier
increased
the dignity of the
gentleman
.
Lady Laura was nearly of my own age, chance
one evening threw me in her way, as I was
walking
with my father, and though fortune had
placed
so
great a
distance
between us,
she
prosessed
a
friendship
for me, which highly gratified
my vanity and delighted my father, as he thought
it would contribute to my future advancement in
life.---But alas! my children, it was the
source
from whence I might trace all my misfortunes.
Lady Laura was lovely in her
person
, and
gentle in her manners,
she
possessed
a
susceptible
heart, and I thought her the pattern of all female
perfection; but in this I was woefully deceived.
She had that
selfish
principle inherent in her
nature
,
which made her prefer her own
happiness
to that of the whole world
beside
; however, this
was an error which I did not
discover
till
she
had
brought inevitable ruin on me, and unfeelingly
triumphed in the
misery
she
had
occasioned
.
From the evening of our
first
interview
she
continually
formed pretences to call at my father's,
and at length, by the Earl's
permission
invited
me to
pass
a few weeks with her at Seymour
Castle
. My father joyfully
consented
to my
accepting
the
prossered
honour, and the day being
appointed, Lady Laura
herself
came in the
chariot
to fetch me.
It was near dinner time when I arrived, I felt
myself
rather
abashed
on being
presented
to the
Earl, and
conscious
of my inferiority, my face
glowed with
confusion
. Lord S was a
venerable
and truly worthy nobleman; he
said
many
obliging things to me, which in
some
measure
encouraged me, and I began to look and
speak
with a tolerable degree of freedom, when being
informed that dinner was
served
, the Earl led me
into the dining room and
presented
me to
Cartain
Melfont.
All my
confusion
now returned. I
blushed
,
trembled, and hardly knew how I behaved
during
dinner, I had never before
conversed
with a
man
so
well-bred, polite, and agreeable as
Captain
Melfont. I
wished
to appear engaging, and
conscious
of my own infignificance,
shrunk
as it
were into nothing, and a
thousand
times
wished
myself
at home again. All day I was
uneasy
and
dissatisfied
with
myself
, every
accomplishment
Lady Laura
displayed
, made me regret not
possessing
the
same
, that I might equally with
her contribute to the
amusement
and
share
the
applause
of Melfont.
In the
course
of a few days my
constraint
gradually
decreased
, the polite freedom with which
I was treated by Lady Laura, and the pointed
attentions I experienced from Melfont,
contributed
to
raise
me in my own
esteem
, and I became
chearful and happy.
As I had ever been
accustomed
to early
rising
,
I was in general up
some
hours
sooner
than Lady
Laura, and
usually
spent
the time till
breakfast
in
the garden,
sometimes
with a book, and
sometimes
with my work. Melfont had frequently
joined me in
these
little morning
excursions
, and
I believe it was the
pleasure
I experienced in
his company, which made me
so
often repeat
them. At
first
he was polite,
unconstrained
and
chearful, but he
soon
grew thoughtful,
pensive
,
and even
absent
. I
saw
the change with
regret
;
I
almost
unknown to
myself
shared
his
uncasiness
,
and whenever he
sighed
involuntarily,
echoed his
sighs
responsively
.
At length I
assumed
courage to enquire the
cause
of his melancholy; he
hesitated
for a few
moments, and then in faultering accents
declared
himself
my lover, at the
same
time
saying
,
he had not the
least
hope of ever being happy,
conjured me to forget him,
pressed
my hand to
his lips, and left me with precipitation.
I now
discovered
the
state
of my own heart,
I felt the
greatest
satisfaction
in the knowledge
of being beloved; but my affliction was great
when I reflected he had
said
an
insurmountable
barrier was placed between us. I was weak
enough to
shed
tears, and could hardly
summon
composure
enough to attend Lady Laura, at the
usual
hour of
breakfast
though I was
conscious
that the indulging an
hopeless
passion
would
entail
lasting
misery
upon me, I never once
attempted
to
subdue
it, or
stifle
emotions which my
own
reason
told me were improper and
imprudent
in a young
person
in my humble
station
;
though I am certain, had I when I
first
discovered
my growing partiality for Melfont,
immediately
left Seymour
Castle
, returned home, and by
entering with avidity into all my
usual
avocations
,
strove
to
banish
him from my mind, and
avoided all opportunities of
seeing
or
conversing
with him, I
should
soon
have
conquered
the predeliction, and regained my
usual
tranquility
,
but I wanted
resolution
to fly the
society
of a man
whose
presence
I fancied
constituted
my chief
happiness
.
Solitude is the
nurse
of youthful
passion
---in
this I was fully indulged at Seymour
Castle
,
being allowed to
pass
my time in a manner
most
suitable
to my own inclination,
whilst
Lady
Laura was engaged with her
several
masters
,
who yet daily attended her. I had at the
same
time contracted a habit of reading for
several
hours
in the day, and unfortunately in the late
Countess's
library met with
several
novels, a
sort
of
reading with which my dear girls are totally
unacquainted;
these
books
served
only to
soften
my mind and
encrease
my
passion
,
so
that by
never attempting to repel it in its
first
approach,
it in time gained an entire
ascendency
over my
heart, formed a part of my
existence
, twined
round the chords of life, and can be
extinguished
only by the hand of death.
Here Dorcas
paused
to give vent to her tears;
Marian wept with her; Lydia threw her arms
round her mother's neck, and
kissing
off the
drops as they fell upon her cheeks, vowed that
no action of hers
should
ever
increase
the
anguish
which already weighed down her too
susceptible
heart. They then retired for the night,
Lydia to the
soft
repose
that ever attends youth
and innocence; Marian to reflect on the fine
things Sir George had
said
, and Dorcas to weep
over
past
afflictions.
THE HISTORY OF DORCAS
CONTINUED.
PART II.
The
sun
had
just
darted his rays upon the
distant
mountains, the dew
still
glittered
on the waving
grass
, when Dorcas
forsook
her
restless
couch, and
summoned
her daughters to
their daily labour, having paid their adoration
to the divine
disposer
of all things, and partook
of a frugal
breakfast
,
she
again continued her
recital.
For
several
mornings after the explanation I
mentioned, I repaired as
usual
to the garden,
but
Melsont
did not join me, indeed he
seemed
particularly
studious
to avoid every opportunity
of
conversing
with me without a third
person
being
present
. I was extremely
uneasy
at this
conduct
,
I imagined he
supposed
me too much his
I
inferior to be made the honorable partner of his
fortune, and in my heart I thanked him for that
honor, which prevented his
soliciting
me on other
terms; yet the
visible
constraint
he put upon
himself
in attempting to appear chearful, pained me
excessively
; I became
absent
, melancholy and
dejected.
Lady Laura frequently interrogated me in her
lively manner on the
cause
of my altered
diposition
,
and one morning when Melfont was in the
room,
she
jocularly
said
, Why, my good
cousin
Charles, what in the name of wonder
possesses
you to be
so
dull, one would think
some
enchantment
prevailed at Seymour
Castle
, and that the
very air was infectious, here is my lively Dory,
metamorphosed
into
musing
melancholy; and
you, my late giddy
cousin
become the grave
sentimental
philosopher
. I verily believe a certain
blind deity has been
busy
with you, come hither,
Charles, let me
see
where the arrow entered, is
the wound deep?
Melfont
answered
rather
peevishy
, and left the
room. I felt my face glow and my heart throbbed
violently, Lady Laura
saw
my emotion, Poor
dear,
said
she
, did it fall in love, and had it no
hope; well, well, never mind it, 'twas all
involuntary
I'll be
sworn
.
Oh! Lady Laura,
said
I,
despise
me not for
my
weakness
.I could
say
no more, tears
burst
from my eyes, and I hid my face with my
handkerchief
.
My dear Dory,
said
she
, taking my hand, I
did not mean to pain your gentle heart, I have
long
seen
the
tenderness
subsisting
between my
cousin
and you, and
assure
you it has given me
peculiar
pleasure
; but my
sweet
little friend,
you
must
be rather cautious to guard your
secret
,
for
should
my father
discover
it, he will
use
every
method to prevent an union between you ever
taking
place, for Charles Melfont is
designed
by him
the
husband
of your Laura.
Had I been transfixed by lightning, my
countenance
could not have
expressed
more horror
and
surprize
. I felt in a moment that I
must
appear
a
monster
of ingratitude in the eyes of the
Earl, when he
should
find I had thus, though
unintentionally counteracted his
designs
, in
regard
to his daughter's future
settlement
. I told
Lady Laura, after what I had
just
heard, I
should
think
myself
unpardonable to remain any longer
at Seymour
Castle
, or ever
suffer
Melfont to
entertain
me again in the character of a lover. I
requested
her to
suffer
me to return home, and
said
, I would, if
possible
, avoid ever
seeing
him
again.
I 2
She laughed at what
she
called my delicate
scruples
, and told me,
she
had in her own mind
planned out future
schemes
of
happiness
for us
all; for to tell you the truth,
said
she
, I have no
great inclination to Charles, being engaged both
by inclination and
solemn
promises
, to a young
man of no great fortune, though of a good family;
he is at
present
only an
ensign
in the guards,
so
that I am certain my father will never
consent
to
our union; but you know, my dear Dory, if you
accept Melfont, I can then avow my choice
openly, and you will at once render
yourself
happy, and confer an obligation on your friend.
In this manner did the artful Laura work on
my feelings, and at length won Melfont over to
her party. We were frequently
witnesses
to
private
interviews between her lover and
herself
,
and in a
short
time
so
far forgot what was due to
our parents, and to our own
interest
and honor,
that we not only planned her
escape
but
accompanied
her
slight
, and the
same
ceremony united
Lady Laura to Mr.
Walsh
, and your mother to
Melfont.
When we returned to Seymour
Castle
we found
it a
seat
of tumult and
confusion
; the Earl
refused
us admittance, and my father, irritated at my
ingratitude
to his patron and benefactor, would not
suffer
me to enter his habitation, not did I from
that unhappy day ever
see
him; my behaviour
had made
such
an
impression
on his mind, that
he fell into a deep melancholy, which
soon
put a
period to his
existence
; the whole of his
possessions
were left to his
nearest
male relation, and my
name was only mentioned in the will, that he
might reprobate my ingratitude.
I can truly
say
, the affliction I felt when
informed
of his
decease
, proceeded
solely
from the
reflection, that I
deserved
his anger, and had not
seen
him or endeavoured to gain his pardon
before
his death.
The
anguish
of my heart was beyond
expression
,
but the unremitting
tenderness
which I
experienced
from my
husband
soon
hushed
my
griefs to
rest
, and I became tranquil, and even
happy.Alas! this
scene
of
serene
pleasure
was not long to
last
; it fleeted away like a
vision
,
and like a
passing
shadow
left no trace
behind.
One year of connubial love was
past
, when
you, my beloved girls, were in one day
ushered
into the world. Melfont was
disappointed
, he
had hoped for a boy, as his family had never
been reconciled to what they termed
so
disproportionate
a match, he imagined
such
an event might
in
some
measure
have conciliated their regard,
I 3
but the birth of my daughters
frustrated
these
hopes; however he
still
continued the kind
attentive
husband
.
I lived extremely retired,
consoling
myself
for
the
loss
of every
pleasure
which a
person
of my
age might
wish
to enjoy, in Melfont's affection;
and while that continued I had no
wish
ungratified
.
Lady Laura frequently
visited
me; her father
had never forgiven her precipitate marriage, nor
did he ever give her any fortune.
Walsh
had married more from the hope of
aggrandizing
himself
than from any affection he
felt for her
Ladyship
. When he found
these
hopes were
illusive
he threw off the
mask
, and
treated her with contempt and
unkindness
, by
which means he rendered her life extremely
wretched.
She
saw
the love and harmony which
subsisted
between your father and me, and from that
spint
of envy which hates to
see
happiness
in
another
family, which it cannot enjoy at home,
she
determined to undermine my felicity, and
render
me as completely wretched as
herself
.
There is a caprice in the heart of man, or
rather
a depravity in their natures, which leads
them to neglect and
despise
a woman totally in
their power, and
pursue
with avidity
those
who
by
almost
insurmountable
obstacles
, are placed at
a
distance
from them. This was exactly the
case
with Melfont. When Lady Laura was offered
to him by her father, when wealth and honor
would have attended his acceptance of her, he
rejected her---but now, irrevocably united to me,
and Laura the wife of another, he began to feel
a
passion
for her, and to
wish
he had not
married
so
precipitately.
This
passion
was at
first
admitted into his
bosom
under the
mask
of pity, he would
listen
to the
frequent complaints
she
made of her hard fate,
soothe
her
distress
, and offer every
consolation
in
his power.
For
some
time I joined him in endeavouring to
alleviate the
sorrows
of the unhappy Laura; but
at length his attentions to her became too pointed
to
escape
the penetrating eye of watchful
tenderness
,
and I was unable to
stifle
that
jealousy
which I had long
strove
to
suppress
.
However afflicted I might be, at the
visible
alteration
in your father's manner, I
suffered
no
complaint to break forth, but
nursed
my
corroding
sorrows
in
silence
and
solitude
; in his
presence
I endeavoured to appear chearful, though
my heart was
almost
broken by his
unkindness
.
Two years had
passed
in this dreadful manner,
when Mr.
Walsh
died, and Lady Laura
became
a blooming widow. Lord S, her
father, was at that time upon the continent,
therefore
she
had no opportunity to make an
immediate
personal
application to him for
reconciliation
.
Lady Laura had long treated me with a cool
hauteur,
she
now no longer wore even the
semblance
of
politeness
, but whenever
she
came to
the
house
, would either not
speak
to me at all,
or treat me with the
most
cruel
disrespect
. I
ventured to complain to Melfont of her
ungenerous
behaviour, when his
answer
struck
me
almost
dumb with
sorrow
and
astonishment
.
I am
surprised
, Madam,
said
he, that you
should
complain to me in this manner, what right
have you to expect particular attention from a
woman of Lady Laura's
distinction
, I think
she
does you too much honor by
condescending
to
enter the
house
where you live. You
should
consider
,
Dory, you are only my
mistress
.
Your
mistress
, Melfont?
Yes,
surely
; you know I was under age when
the ceremony was performed. I have never
introduced
you to my family as my wife, nor have
they ever
considered
you as
such
.
I heard no more, a cold damp came over me,
I
shuddered
and fell
lifeless
to the floor.When
I recovered, I found your cruel father had left
me, in that
state
of
insensibility
, to the care of
the
servants
. I gave free vent to my
sorrows
in
a flood of tears, and then
summoning
all the
fortitude
I could to my
assistance
, called for pen and
ink, and wrote a letter to Melfont, a copy of
which I have
preserved
.
TO MELFONT.
SIR,
Since
you inform me I am not your wife,
be
assured
I retain too high a
sense
of honor to
remain with you on any other terms; but do not
flatter
yourself
I mean tamely to give up a title
which I think I have an undoubted right to,
having
received it at the altar, and borne it three
years, during which time I have never
disgraced
it by thought, word, or action. Before you
receive
this, I
shall
be far advanced on my way
towards
Paris, where I mean to
submit
my
cause
to
the
decision
of the Earl of S, who, though
I have greatly injured, is the only
person
I can at
this time with propriety apply to, or hope to
receive
assistance
from. I know him to be a
nobleman
of too much honor and humanity to
suffer
an
insult
offered to an unprotected woman to go
unrevenged
.
He is the friend of the widow and
the
fatherless
, and in that rank I
must
place
myself
,
and your unhappy children, till you
restore
me to that which no action of mine has ever
forfeited
.
Your affectionate,
but injured wife,
DORCAS MELFONT.
When I had
finished
this letter I ordered a
chaise
and four, and bidding the
servant
put up
a few things, took you, my beloved girls,
and
desiring
the letter might be delivered to
your father when he came home, which I knew
would not be till late at night,
set
off full
speed
to
Dover.
We travelled all night, and was lucky enough
to arrive
just
as a packet was
sailing
for Calais, I
immediately embarked, a few hours
wasted
us
across
the channel, and I then travelled with as
much
speed
as
possible
to Paris. It was late when
I arrived, and being greatly fatigued with my
journey, I determined to
stay
till the next
morning
before I waited on the Earl. I took an
hasty
supper
and retired, in hope to recruit my
exhausted
frame by
sleep
.
The next morning I
arose
early, and
dressing
myself
, took my dear children in my hand, and
repaired to the Earl's. I was with difficulty
admitted
,
and when I entered the room where his
Lordship
was at
breakfast
, my agitation was
so
great I could
scarcely
stand
.
Dorcas!
said
his
Lordship
,
starting
from his
seat
.
Oh! my Lord,
said
I, (throwing
myself
at his
feet, and
presenting
my girls to him) behold a
miserable
woman and two
helpless
infants, who
without your
assisting
hand
must
be plunged in
infamy and inevitable ruin.
Rise
, Dorcas,
said
his
Lordship
, explain
yourself
,
your agitation at
present
deranges your
ideas.
I then in a few words told him, that Melfont
had
disowned
me for his wife, and that I was
certain
he meant to marry Lady Laura.
Heaven forbid,
said
the Earl, that my poor
infatuated
girl
should
add
such
an heinous offence
against
humanity, to the catalogue of her former
crimes. Oh! Dorcas, her undutiful behaviour
has been like a viper preying upon my heart; and
to
increase
my affliction, I have been told
she
has
dishonored
even the man for whom
she
forsook
her father's protection. But this will be an act to
make honor and humanity
blush
. Be comforted,
continued he, for the
sake
of
these
poor
innocents
,
I will not
suffer
your wrongs to
pass
unnoticed
or
unredressed
. Cheared by
these
kind
expressions
I returned to my lodgings, with a heart
considerably
lightened, and was
desired
to call
on the Earl again in about ten days, when he
should
have had time to
consult
what was
best
to
be done. On the appointed morning I repaired
to the Earl, I found him
seated
at a table writing,
a letter lay unfolded before him.
Dorcas,
said
he, (
rising
and leading me to a
seat
) I have received letters from England
since
I
saw
you.
Do they mention me, my Lord?
Yes, they
say
you have long led a very
dissolute
life, and that you have eloped from your
husband
with a young officer, and taken with you a
quantity of money and jewels.
Heaven forgive them,
said
I, and
burst
into
tears.
But this is not all, my poor girl, continued the
Earl, you have
worse
trials than this to
encounter
.
Then I hope God will give me fortitude to
support
them,
said
I, but indeed my heart is
almost
broke already. However, my Lord, let me
know the
worst
, and I will endeavour to bear it
with patience.
Melfont is married to Lady Laura.
Cruel Melfont, how have I
deserved
this
inhuman
usage
.
After you left me the other day,
said
the Earl,
I
sent
a
messenger
express
to endeavour to procure
a certificate of your marriage, and to take a letter
to Laura,
promising
pardon and
forgetfulness
of
all that was
past
if
she
would not marry Melfont,
but in
case
she
chose
to follow the bent of her own
depraved inclination, to never
assume
the title of
K
my daughter again, for from that moment I would
disown
her. My
messenger
returned
yesterday
,
and informs me, it is
impossible
to procure a
certificate
,
as the clergyman who married you was
dead, and that the day after you left England,
Melfont publicly
espoused
Lady Laura.
Merciful heaven,
said
I, (
sinking
on my knees)
to your care I commit my dear injured children.
Oh!
suffer
them not to be
punished
for the
sins
of
their parents; make me the object of thy wrath
for my
disobedience
and ingratitude, but Oh! of
thy infinite mercy avert the
shafts
of keen
adversity
from the
bosom
of my beloved girls.
The Earl was affected, he dropped a tear in
compassion
to my
anguish
, and
promised
to be my
protector. The next day he gave me a deed, in
which he
settled
this cottage and its appendages,
with one hundred pounds a year, on me during
my life, and to be continued to my children as
long as they by their conduct
should
merit his
protection. I remained in France a few days,
just
to recruit my
strength
and
spirits
, and then
set
forward for this place, where I have lived now
seventeen
years, endeavouring to form the minds
of my children in
such
a manner, that the follies
which
occasioned
their mother's misfortunes
might never find entrance in their hearts.
Oh! Marian,
listen
not to the voice of
adulation
,
stifle
every
rising
ambitious thought, be
humble
,
be innocent, and be happy.
END OF VOL. I.Vol. II. A 2
MARIAN AND LYDIA
CONTINUED.
PART IV.
Marian
listened
attentively to the
affecting
recital of her mother's
sorrow
, but
every
syllable
sunk
deep into the heart of Lydia. I
will daily think of your
distresses
, my dear
mother
,
said
she
, and they will
serve
as a
shield
to
my heart, and render it invulnerable to the
attacks
of vanity or the
illusion
of
passion
.
And is my father living?
said
Marian.
I know not, replied her mother, but if he is
he can never be any thing to you, he has
renounced
us all.
It was inhuman, my dear mother, to deprive us
of that rank in life, we were born to fill, and
which I
slatter
myself
we
should
not have
disgraced
.
Foolish
Marian,
said
the anxious mother, why
regret the
loss
of
such
a trifle; be virtuous, my
child, you will then elevate the
most
humiliating
station
, and
rise
superior
to
those
whose
only
boast
is wealth and titles, to render them the envy of the
blind
misguided
multitude. Virtue alone is true
nobility; content is real
happiness
.
Lydia's heart
responsive
echoed her mother's
sentiments
Marian
sighed
and was
silent
.
The moon in
majestic
splendor
illumined the
sky
, and darted her
silver
beams through the
ancient
elms that
shaded
Dorcas's cottage. The
sisters
were
seated
by the door, and in obedience to
their mother's command, were pouring forth their
thanksgiving
to the giver of all
blessing
in an
evening hymn. They had
just
finished
when
a
rustling
among the
bushes
made them
start
; a
beautiful pointer ran into the cottage, and in a
moment a
servant
in livery appeared, and
enquired
the way to Gwinfred-Hall. Dorcas directed
him which way to go. He
said
he was weary,
requested
a drop of water, and leave to
rest
. Lydia
went to fetch him
some
cyder, Dorcas moved
towards
A 3
the door, and
silently
admired the beauty
of the
spangled
firmament.
The man
seized
the opportunity, and delivered
to the lovely
unsuspecting
Marian a letter from
Sir George Lovemore.
Love and ambition had already taught her art,
she
hastily
took the offered letter, and hid it in her
bosom
. Alas!
simple
maid, you there
fostered
a
serpent
,
whose
subtle
poison
tainted your very
heart. The
servant
having completed his errand
retired, and Marian found means to
peruse
her
letter;  it abounded with
professions
of love,
vows of
everlasting
fidelity, and encomiums on
her beauty. She read it with rapture, and though
so
recently warned of the duplicity of men,
believed
every
syllable
it contained. In
conclusion
,
he
solicited
a private interview the next morning,
in the field adjoining her mother's cottage.
Marian
paused
at this
request
,
hesitated
read
the letter again and
resolved
to comply.
During
supper
she
was thoughtful and
absent
,
and when the
usual
hour of
rest
arrived,
she
retired
with an anxious perturbed mind;
sleep
was
a stranger to her eyes, and
several
times
she
almost
resolved
to
shew
the letter to Lydia, and
request
her to accompany her  But then Sir
George had
desired
her to come alone, he might
be offended and
she
might never
see
him again.
Vanity
also
pleaded, he might marry her,
raise
her to an exalted
station
, and
should
his views
be
otherwise
than honorable,
she
certainly had
resolution
to
withstand
his
solicitations
.
In this manner did
she
wear out the tedious
night, at five o'clock
she
stole
softly
from the
side
of her innocent
sleeping
sister
, and with as little
noise
as
possible
opened the door that led into the
fields. Aurora had but faintly
streaked
the
eastern
skies
with mingled gold and purple, when the
ill-fated Marian met her lover.
He thanked her for her
condescention
, told her
his whole
happiness
depended on her, and urged
her immediate
slight
with him to London.
Marian
hesitated
, her mother, her
sister
, hung
heavy at her heart.
Sir George was an adept in the art of seduction,
he talked of gaiety,
splendor
and
pleasure
,
swore
she
was born to grace the
first
station
, declared it
was a crime to bury
so
much beauty and
sweetness
in a
desart
.
Marian's
reason
was not convinced, but her
vanity was awakened and her
senses
dazzled,
what wonder then that her
scruples
were
overcome
by Sir George's artful
persuasions
. She
left the
mansion
of peace and innocence, and in a
chaise
which he had prepared for the
purpose
,
hurried as
fast
as four
horses
would carry her to
the feat of
dissipation
and folly.
Marian dropped a tear as
she
took a
last
look at
the cottage, but Sir George
kissed
it off, and the
reflection which had
caused
it to
start
was
instantly
banished
from her mind.
Lydia on awakening
missed
her
sister
, and
hastily
rising
, ran into her mother's apartment, vexed
that Marian
should
have been the
first
to bid her
good morning. I am not
used
to be
such
a
suaggard
,
my dear mother,
said
she
, but my
sister
has received your
blessing
before me this morning.
I have not
seen
your
sister
,
said
Dorcas, but as it
is a fine morning,
she
has, no doubt, rambled out
to enjoy its
sweets
; go, my beloved Lydia and
seek
her.
Lydia left her mother, and
sought
her
sister
in
the fields and woods; echo a
thousand
times
repeated
the name as
she
called her dear Marian; at
length fatigued and
dispirited
,
she
was returning
home, when
she
met a
shepherd
, who early
attended
his
sheep
, that way, and demanded of him
whether he had
seen
her
sister
.
He had
seen
her, he
saw
her enter the
chaise
with Sir George, he
saw
them drive off.
Lydia heard the heart-rending tidings,
she
would have wept, but tears
refused
their relief;
she
sighed
,
raised
her hands to heaven in an
agony
of grief, and
sunk
lifeless
upon the ground.
The
shepherd
was frightened, nor did he
use
any
method to
restore
her, but ran backward and
forward, looking wildly round him, and calling
aloud for help. A young gentleman who had
been that morning out a
shooting
, heard the voice
of terror, and
hastened
to the
spot
where the
hapless
Lydia lay. Her charms were not of the
dazzling
fort, but the more her features were
examined
the more they
interested
the beholder. The
gentleman when he
first
raised
her from the ground,
felt only for her as he would for any other woman
in
distress
; but when he looked attentively on her
face, and beheld her lovely though inanimate
features
,
he felt an
irresistible
impulse
to defend her
not only from her
present
uneasiness
, but to
shield
her for ever from pain and affliction. He carried
her to a
spring
, and bathed her temples with water,
she
opened her
expressive
blue eyes, Oh! my
unhappy
sister
,
said
she
, and freeing
herself
from the
arms of her deliverer, covered her face with her
hands, and gave free vent to her tears.
Have you
lost
your
sister
, my
sweet
maid,
said
the
stranger
.
Alas! Sir, replied Lydia, I fear my poor Marian
is
worse
than dead. A gentleman has found means
to
ensnare
her innocent
unsuspecting
heart, and
she
has this morning left her only friends to
trust
the
promises
of one
she
never
saw
till three days
since
. I know not how to return to my poor
mother
with
these
fatal tidings, I fear it will go near
to break an heart already
oppressed
with woes
almost
too heavy to be borne. But God
tempereth
the wind to the
shorn
lamb, continued
she
,
raising
her eyes to heaven, and no doubt will
inspire
her with fortitude to bear, wihout repining,
this
heaviest
of his trials.
The
stranger
reverenced her
sorrow
, he took
her
passive
hand, drew it under his arm, and
so
proceeded
silently
along towards Dorcas's cottage;
he attempted not to interrupt her grief, but now
and then a tear
stole
down his manly cheeks, and a
responsive
sigh
answered
hers.
When they arrived at the cottage Dorcas met
them at the door; Lydia flew towards her,
folded
her arms round her neck, and dropping her
head on her
bosom
,
sobbed
aloud.
Oh! my beloved,
said
Dorcas, tell me, has
any accident happened to your
sister
?
She is gone,
said
Lydia.
What, forever? cried the fond mother eagerly.
Oh! my dear mother,
she
is
lost
to us; that
gentleman
whom we met
Enough,
said
Dorcas, I fully
understand
the
extent of my misfortune; my Marian is
dishonored
,
plunged in infamy; but I will not renounce
her,
she
is my child. Oh! heavens, none but
a parent can judge of the
anguish
that now
harrows
up my
soul
. But, my
sweet
Lydia, will
you
forsake
your mother in her old age, will you
leave her grey hairs to
sink
in
sorrow
to the grave,
without a friend to chear her
last
moments,
without
the gentle hand of filial love to
close
her
dying eyes.
Oh! no, cried Lydia, dropping on her knees,
never, never; when I
forsake
my honor'd mother,
may heaven
regardless
hear me when I pray, may
I be
cast
out to
sickness
, pain and poverty,
without
a friend to pity or relieve me.
Dorcas embraced her, and the
stranger
endeavoured
to
dissipate
the drops of humanity which
were gathering in her eyes. Lydia by degrees
became more
composed
, and informed her mother
of the obligations
she
was under to the gentleman
who had accompanied her home.
Oh! Sir,
said
Dorcas, you are my friend and
benefactor, had I
lost
my Lydia I had
lost
my all;
but
say
, by what name
shall
I remember you in
my prayers?
They call me Renfew, Earl of Landaff,
said
he.
Dorcas
started
and turned palethe Earl
continued,
Your
sorrow
has awakened in my
breast
every
feeling of humanity, and if it is in my power
to be of any
service
to you, command me, and
I will exert it to the
utmost
.
Alas! my dear Marian!
said
Dorcas.
I
understand
you, replied the Earl, and
wish
I could
restore
her to you, but as that is not in my
power, teach me by
some
other means to promote
your
happiness
.
My Lord,
said
Dorcas, there is but one way
to give the
least
satisfaction
to this afflicted heart;
leave the cottage immediately, nor ever attempt
again to
see
or
converse
with Lydia.
And why this cruel
restriction
?
Time, my Lord, perhaps may inform you with
my
reasons
for acting thus. At
present
I cannot
alledge the true
cause
, and will never
stoop
to a
mean equivocation to
excuse
an action, which I
am
sensible
is perfectly right.
The Earl was piqued, he bowed and left the
cottage.
Lydia,
said
Dorcas, if you love your mother,
you will avoid the Earl of Landaff.
He is generous and humane,
said
Lydia,
Trust
not to appearances, replied her mother,
when you
shall
learn a tale which I could tell you,
you will then, like me, tremble at the name of
Renfew.
Peace, with the
speed
of a courier, now fled
from the
mansion
of Dorcas, affliction
usurped
her place, and with
solemn
pace each night
walled
with the
solitary
Lydia over
those
fields an
Vol. II. B
meadows where
she
once had cheerfully tripped
with her beloved Marian.
In one of
these
melancholy
excursions
she
was
accosted
by the Earl of Landaff;
she
would have
fled, but he prevented her, and in the
most
eloquent
language true love could
inspire
, told her
how dear
she
was to him, and how cruel he
thought her mother, in
refusing
him the
pleasure
of her
conversation
.
My mother, replied Lydia, can be actuated by
no motive but a
wish
to promote my
happiness
.
I
esteem
you, my Lord, I
shall
ever remember
you with gratitude, but my mother has forbid me
to hold any
coversation
with you. Adieu, Sir,
I often think of you, but will never have any
intercourse
with you.
Stay, my
sweet
Lydia,
said
the Earl, only
say
you do not hate me. I
swear
, dear maid, my
designs
are honorable, and if you will put
yourself
under my protection, a private marriage
shall
convince you how
sincere
my
professions
are.
My Lord, replied Lydia, though I
acknowledge
myself
honored by this declaration, I
must
decline accepting your offer; I know my rank
in life is far beneath what would be expected in
the bride of Landaff, but humble as I am, I will
never become the wife of a man who would be
ashamed
publicly to own me as
such
; nor will I
ever
clandestinely
converse
with a
person
whom
my mother has forbid me to
see
. My
sister
, I
fear, by her
disobedience
, has rendered
herself
miserable
, nor will I, by a like conduct,
increase
the affliction of my dear venerable parent.
Landaff expatiated on the many advantages
attending wealth and
splendor
; Lydia heard him
with
silent
contempt. He told her his only
wish
was, to make her happy.
That is
impossible
, my Lord,
said
she
, the heart of
Lydia never can know
happiness
while her
mother
is in affliction, and her
sister
, perhaps, a
miserable
wanderer,
exposed
to all the
wretchedness
,
want and infamy can entail on a fallen
woman.
All farther
persuasion
was of no effect, Lydia
continued firm in her
resolution
of not leaving
her mother, and fearful of again meeting the
importunate Earl, avoided for
some
time her
favorite walk, confined
herself
to the narrow
limits of their garden, and devoted her time
entirely to comfort and chear her afflicted parent.
The Earl finding no hope of
success
in
drawing
Lydia from her duty, and having too much
regard for virtue to force
himself
into their
solitude,
with an intent to rob them of their only
treasure, repaired to London, thinking time and
absence
would effectually
banish
her from his
memory.
We will now leave Lydia, following her
usual
innocent avocations, and return to Marian,
who was emerged in the vortex of
fashionable
folly.
When Sir George
persuaded
the
unsuspecting
Marian to leave her home, and
trust
to his honor
for protection,
she
had no doubt but his
design
was to marry her; he had never told her
so
indeed, but
surely
he could mean nothing
less
--
he had declared he loved her, and did not men always marry
the women they loved? Thus with
fallacious hopes did
she
quiet each
rising
fear,
and by painting to
herself
the
pleasure
her
mother
and
sister
would experience when they
should
embrace her as Lady Lovemore, entirely
obliterated
the pain
she
felt in reflecting on the
uneasiness
they would
suffer
when her flight
should
be
discovered
.
Sir George had never formed an idea of
making
her his wife, he
saw
she
was beautiful, he felt
he loved her, and thought by
lavishing
on her
riches and finery, to which
she
had hitherto been
unaccustomed
, to
ensnare
and lead her an
easy
victim to be
sacrificed
at the
shrine
of vice. To
this end he forbore taking any liberty during their
journey which might alarm her, treated her with
respect
and tender attention, and when they
arrived
in London placed her in an elegant lodging,
with proper
servants
to wait on her, and left her
to ruminate at
leisure
on the change in her
situation
.
The female attendant who was immediately
about
the
person
of Marian, was a girl who had
formerly
fallen a prey to the arts of Sir George, and
now only enjoyed his bounty for reducing other
hapless
females to the horrid level with
herself
.
She was wretched in the
loss
of her own virtue,
and like the
spoiler
of mankind, exulted in every
opportunity of robbing others of that
blessing
herself
could no longer enjoy. She treated the
innocent
Marian with the
most
profound
respect
, led
her through a
suit
of
superb
apartments and told
her; if
she
could think of any thing that
would add to the elegance or beauty of the
furniture
,
she
need only mention her
wishes
to have them
complied with. She next
displayed
a variety of
elegant female apparel, toys, jewels, and other
things proper to catch the attention of
inexperienced
youth, and kindle the glowing
seeds
of
vanity into a flame that might
consume
her,
at that time was without a favorite, and from the
prepossession
he felt in his
bosom
towards our poor
wanderer, he determined to
raise
her from the
abject
state
to which
she
was reduced, to the
honorable
station
of his
mistress
; he therefore
dispatched
his
visits
as quick as
possible
, and
repaired to the place of appointment.
Marian met him at the door of the apartment,
he gave her his hand,
she
raised
it to her lips, and
attempted to
speak
, but words were
refused
, a
gush
of
silent
tears more eloquently
spoke
her
soul
's
meaning--the Major was moved, he made her
sit
, down, and placing
himself
beside
her, began
to unfold the
designs
he had formed in her favour.
Alas! Sir,
said
Marian mournfully, I had hoped
you would have taken me from this life of
shame
,
indeed I am
sick
of what is termed
pleasure
, I
long to
sink
into peaceful
obscurity
, and having
just
sufficient
to
supply
the wants of nature,
repent
my
past
misdeeds
, and wait with patience the
appointed hour of
rest
. I know not why it is, but
I feel I never can return your
generosity
in the
way you require, and therefore dare not hope for
farther favours.
Nay, my dear girl,
said
the Major, this is
affectation; come
shake
off this gloom which your
misfortunes have
occasioned
to envelope your
mind---what, though I am an old man, I will
teach you to love me.
Oh! Sir, replied Maran, you have taught me
that already, there is nothing which I
should
think too hard to perform, to convince you of the
grateful affections of my heart. But I had hoped
this
sinking
fragile frame never would have
known pollution more.
The Major endeavoured to calm the
perturbation
of her
spirits
, and
pressed
her to partake of
some
excellent champaigne which he had ordered
with the
supper
. Marian was thoughtful, eat,
little, and frequently turned her head to hide the
starting
tears.
Supper removed he renewed his
solicitations
,
she
sunk
on her knees, and with uplifted hands
entreated him to grant her relief on other terms,
or
suffer
her to leave him, and again tempt the
miseries
of her hard
destiny
. He was deaf to her
prayers, he attributed them to art--he
raised
her
from the ground, and proceeded to unwarrantable
liberties--
she
made a violent effort, and
springing
from his arms, cried, Oh! Dorcas, dear
unhappy
mother, why did I leave you,--then
rushing
out of the room, ran precipitately into the
street
.
The exclamation which
she
made had thrown
the Major into a
stupor
of
astonishment
, every
faculty was
suspended
, nor could he recover
sufficient
recollection to endeavour to
stop
her--
a
thousand
past
occurrences
rushed
upon his mind,
and he remained immoveable, his eyes rivetted
to the door through which
she
had
passed
.
At length recovering from his
surprise
, he
observed
a
small
shagreen
case
which lay on the floor,
and during her
struggles
had dropped from
Marian's
bosom
. He took it up, with emotion opened
it, and the portrait of Dorcas met his eyes.
The
case
dropped from his unnerved hand, he
groaned and fell
senseless
to the floor, the
noise
of his fall brought up a
servant
of the
house
,
proper remedies were applied and
soon
restored
him to a keen
sense
of his
past
guilt and treachery
to Dorcas, for Major Renfew was the perjured
husband
whom Dorcas had concealed under the
name of Melfont.
The
first
thought that
struck
him was the horrid
crime he had
so
nearly perpetrated; the next
was what was become of his poor ruined child---
His continual ravings for his Marian, his dear
lost
daughter, and the evident incoherence of his
discourse
led the
servants
to believe he was fiezed
with a
sudden
fit of
insanity
, and in that belief
conveyed him home.
The horror that dwelt upon his mind, and the
violent agitation brought on a fever, and before
morning he was
insensible
to all that
passed
about him. Before
reason
entirely
forsook
him,
he was
visited
by the Earl of Landaff, who was
his nephew, to him he unfolded the dreadful tale,
conjuring him to try every
possible
method to
discover
the unhappy wanderer.
Oh!
said
he in an agony,
she
knelt and prayed,
my child entreated me, with
streaming
eyes, to
snatch
her from infamy, and I would not hear
her,----
seek
her Landaff, find her,
save
her from
perishing
for want. The remembrance was too
acute, and his
senses
, which were before
wavering
,
took their flight--but
still
his fancy was
haunted by the image of Dorcas and Marian, and
his agonies became dreadful, even to
those
who
attended him.
Every enquiry after the
hapless
Marian was
fruitless
, and the
miserable
Renfew, when a turn
of his
disorder
restored
him to
reason
, found
that there was no hope of recovering the poor
wanderer
The picture
discovered
to the Earl of Landaff
that Dorcas was the mother and Lydia the
sister
of the woman who had
caused
such
anxious
emotions
in his uncle's
bosom
, but how Lydia and
Vol. II. C
Marian
should
be the daughters of Major
Renfew
appeared to him an inexplicable riddle. His
uncle
soon
unravelled the
mystery
, and received
some
consolation
from hearing that Dorcas was
living, and that he might hope to embrace one
innocent child, in his Lydia.
He determined to
seek
Dorcas in her
solitude
,
and acknowledge her to the world as his
first
and
only true affianced wife; but fearing to alarm her
by too abrupt an appearance, he
addressed
her
first
by letter.
TO DORCAS.
By
what title
shall
I
address
you, dear
injured
excellence, but by that which
must
make me appear what I really amthe
vilest
,
the
basest
of mankind.
Oh! Dorcas, cruel as my conduct was to
you, my
punishment
, I
trust
, has been equal to my
faultalas! the crimes of the father have been
visited
upon the child. Oh! my beloved, will
not your gentle heart break when I
shall
tell
you I have
seen
our dear MarianI have
seen
her a wretched nightly wandererI
heard her implore charity, I
saw
her
overpowered
with
anguish
of heart, and relieved her not,
but drove her from me, drove her again upon the
merciless
world,
exposed
to all the
miseries
of
want!But my old tough heart will not
burst
,
though it
swells
and throbs at the remembrance
of that dreadful evening.
My Dorcas, I will do you
justice
, I will
declare
to the world your injuries and my own
persidy
. Prepare my love, to meet your penitent
Renfew
soon
after the receipt of this, and bid
my
sweet
, my innocent Lydia, prepare to receive
a father's
blessing
.
Adieu. Many days
shall
not
pass
e'er I hope
to hear you pronounce my pardon, and
clasp
you to the heart of your repentant
husband
,
RENFEW.
From the day of Marian's elopement
pleasure
had been a
stranger
to the heart of Dorcas, nor
could all the duteous
tenderness
of Lydia
dissipate
the anxiety
she
felt for the fate of Marian
from her maternal
breast
. Nor did joy now
sparkle
in the eye of Lydia, the tear of
sorrow
had quenched their
lustre
, and like a
lutre">lustre
, and like a
canker-worm
had fed upon her cheek, and
stole
from
C 2
thence the
blushing
rose
. Full oft
she
wept her
hapless
sister
's fall, full oft
she
sighed
and
wished
to hear again of Landaff, but her tears fell only
on her pillow, when the
sable
curtain of night
hid them from the prying eye of maternal
affection
,
and her
sighs
stole
forth when no one was
nigh to hear them.
MARIAN AND LYDIA,
PART VI.
Twas
night, a chearful fire illumined their
little cottage, but
sorrow
still
sat
heavy on
the heart of Dorcasthe wind blew, the cold
rain beat
against
the
casement
; and where now
is my poor Marian?
said
she
,
sighing
deeply.
I will
sing
you your favorite hymn,
said
Lydia,
kissing
off a tear as it fell on her mother's
cheek, and
struggling
to
suppress
its
sympathising
sister
that trembled in her own eye.
She took up her guitar,
she
wished
to divert her
mother's attention from the painful reflections which
then occupied her thoughts;
she
passed
her fingers
across
the
strings
, the tones were
discordant
, it is
not in tune,
said
she
. Alas! my dear Lydia,
replied her mother, it is our minds that are not
harmonized. She
understood
the meaning of her
mother's words, but, making no
answer
, began to
C 3
sing
an evening hymn of thanks. The
sudden
trampling of a
horse
interrupted her, a loud
rapping at the door alarmed themLydia
opened the door, a
servant
entered. Dorcas
looked
earnestly
at him; he threw
aside
his
riding
coat,
she
knew the livery, and
instantly
recognized
an old and favorite
servant
of Major
Renfew.
Simon,
said
she
, turning pale and
rising
as
she
spoke
, why are you here?
My dear honored lady, I come from my
master
,
who repents his injurious treatment of you,
and comes to do you
justice
; but let this
letter
speak
for him.
And where is Lady Laura,
said
Dorcas,
taking
the letter.
She left my
master
some
years
since
, and now
leads a life of
shame
.
Poor
misguided
Laura,
said
Dorcas, as the
broke the
seal
.
When
she
read the
first
lines joy lightened
up her features, and a
transient
glow of
pleasure
passed
across
her face; but as
she
proceeded her
hands trembled, her countenance
assumed
a
deathly
hue, and large drops of unutterable
anguish
,
chased
each other down her cheeksthe letter
fell to the ground,
she
clasped
her hands and
raised
her eyes towards heaven.
Omnipotent power,
said
she
, teach me to
receive
these
tidings as I ought, thy mercies and
thy judgments go hand in hand. Oh! make me
thankful for the one and
submissive
to the other.
Thou
hast
mingled thy judgments and thy
bounties
in my cup of life;
lest
while receiving only
benefits I
should
forget the
source
from whence
those
mercies flow. Lydia, continued
she
, you
will receive a father's
blessing
, but my poor
Marian
is
lost
for ever.
Two days after Major Renfew had
dispatched
the letter to Dorcas, he
set
forward for Wales,
accompanied by the Earl of Landaff; it was
nearly the
close
of the third day, they had arrived
within a few miles of the cottage, and had
slackened
their pace, that a
servant
might have time
to inform Dorcas of their near approach. The
Major's
bosom
was agitated by the
most
painful
sensations
, the Earl was animated by hope. The
road was
solitary
,
skirted
on one
side
by a thick
wood, from whence they
several
times imagined
they heard a voice of complaint, the Major
stopped
his
horse
and
stood
in the attitude of
listening
.
Ah! woe is me,
said
the voice, I can get no
farther, I
must
e'en
perish
here.
Landaff
dismounted
instantly
and
rushed
into
the wood, the Major would have followed but a
sudden
pang
seized
him, he
respired
with
difficulty
and was forced to
support
himself
again a
tree. In a few moments Landaff returned, a
female
rested
on his arm, her emaciated frame but
slenderly
sheltered
from the inclemencies of the
weather, by a tattered gown; her hair
loose
and
dishevelled
, her feet bare and bleeding from
wounds
she
had received from
sharp
stones
, as
she
walked. Here is a
sight
of
misery
,
said
the
Earl.
The Major looked at the unhappy girl, and
through the
shade
which extreme want,
sickness
,
and even
disordered
reason
had
cast
over
her countenance,
instantly
discovered
the
seatures
of Marian.
Merciful heaven, he exclaimed, it is my
child.
Have you a child,
said
Marian, catching at his
last
words, then for pity's
sake
don't
forsake
her.
I had a father once, I had a lover too; but you
see
how it is with me now, I am poor, very
wretched, and I
sometimes
think not quite in my
right
senses
. I have a mother who lives
somewhere
here about, I have travelled a long way in
hopes to find her, but I know not how it is, I
have eat
so
little, and wept
so
much, I was
obliged to
sit
down and
rest
. Do but
see
how
my poor feet bleed.
Oh! my dear child, cried the Major, you
make my heart bleed drop for drop with them;
but I am going to your mother's, and will
shew
you the way.
You are a man,
said
she
, and I dare not
trust
you; they are all hard-hearted, cruel and
treacherous
.
I once, continued
she
, looking
earnestly
in the Major's face, I once met a man,
but 'tis a long time
since
, who looked and
spoke
as you do, only not quite
so
sorrowful
I was
miserable
then, and he
promised
to be my friend,
but he did not mean it; he
used
me very
cruelly, I hardly know how I got from him, and
have been wandering about ever
since
,
sometimes
one cold
stone
,
sometimes
another has been my
pillow. I bear it as well as I can, we all
must
suffer
according to our offences.
Dear lunatic,
said
the Major, what a
lesson
dost
thou teach thy father.
That is true,
said
she
, you have a child, if
it is a daughter, bring her to me, and I will teach
her
such
a
lesson
I have it here (laying her hand
on her heart) it can never be
erased
but by the
hand of death. Oh! I would tell her
such
tales
of men, would teach her to beware their
flattery
,
to
shut
herself
in retirement, to pray for
humility. Oh!
sye
upon it,
sye
upon it, 'tis a
bad world, but I'll to my mother, for I am
sick
,
heart-
sick
of its
sollies
.
She then darted precipitately into the wood,
but had not proceeded many
steps
, when
overcome
with fatigue, long
fasting
, and the
agitation
of her
disordered
spirits
,
she
sunk
under the
complicated evils, and fell fainting to the ground.
Renfew was too much
absorbed
in his own
feelings
to be able to give any orders concerning his
unhappy daughter, and could only exclaim,
These
are thy works, oh vice; look, old
Renfew
,
behold the ruin of thy child, and remember
'tis the reward of thy own ingratitude,
persidy
and cruelty.
Landaff
assisted
the
servants
in
raising
Marian,
and being then but a
short
distance
from the
cottage
,
persuaded
his uncle to ride forward,
accompanied
by one
servant
, while he followed with
the other two
supporting
Marian between them.
And is this the peace offering I
shall
carry to
my afflicted Dorcas, a daughter murdered by the
inhumanity of a father,
said
the Major as he
proceeded.
Dorcas had been
listening
to every
passing
breeze, and counting the minutes, chiding their
tardy
progress
. The
sound
of
horses
feet caught
her ear,
she
met her repentant Renfew at the
door, threw
herself
into his arms, and fainted.
Lydia knelt and received a father's
blessing
.
Words are too languid to
describe
the
ensuing
scene
,
suffice
it to
say
, for Marian was for
a moment forgot, for a moment they were all
happy; but they were awakened from this dream
of
bliss
by the approach of Landaff.
Lydia
started
as
she
drew near the door,
Renfew
struck
his forehead with his hand, and
bursting
from the embraces of Dorcas,
rushed
out of the room.
Marian was beginning to recover her
fenses
as they entered the cottage. Lydia thought it
was a
stranger
, poor and
sickly
, and as
she
lent
her arm to
assist
in leading her in, a tear fell
in
compassion
to her
weakness
and appatent
misery
.
Marian
sunk
into a chair, folded her
arms round Lydia's
waist
, and gazing at her
for a moment, recollection and
reason
at once
returned,
she
dropped her head on her
bosom
and
cried, it is indeed my
sister
.
The voice was familiar to Dorcas. That voice
should
be the voice of Marian,
said
she
, but alas!
the form retains no traces of my once lovely
innocent child.
Innocence and peace are fled together,
said
Marian, grant me but pardon and let medie at your
feet;
she
sunk
upon her knees, Lydia knelt
beside
her; the afflicted mother wept over her,
blessed
and forgave her.
Enough,
said
Marian, this was the only prayer
I dared to offer at the throne of grace
since
I left
my home, and became acquainted with guilt and
misery
; how it has
pleased
heaven to direct me
to you I know not. I have
some
faint
recollection
of an horrid dream, but all things
seem
fading from my memory, an icy
chillness
hangs
about my heart, I feel the
springs
of life are
quite
exhausted
.
Oh!
spare
her,
spare
my child, merciful
heaven, cried Dorcas,
sinking
on her knees.
It cannot be,
said
the expiring
sufferer
, I die,
but a mother's
blessing
softens
even the agonies
of death, Oh! had I but
deserved
it.
She
raised
her hands and eyes in a fervent
though inarticulate ejaculation to heaven, and
uttering a piercing groan expired.
Renfew heard the groan, he heard the cries of
Dorcas and LydiaAnd is
she
dead,
said
he,
rushing
in and catching the pale
corse
in his arms,
Oh! Marian! Marian! why
shouldest
thou pay
the forfeit of thy father's crimes? But tell me,
continued he, who was her
seducer
; who
plunged my child into this
abyss
of
misery
;
teach me where to find him, that with his heart's
blood I may
wash
out the
stain
he has entailed
upon the name of Renfew.
Forbear,
said
Dorcas, laying her hand upon
his arm, while a beam of mingled piety and
fortitude illumined her countenance, forbear,
the hand of heaven is in it, accept its
just
chastisements
with humility, and remembering only
thine own offences, blot from thy memory the
offences of others.
Renfew turned from her, folded his arms upon
his
bosom
, and was
silent
.
Vol. II. D
A few days after the ill-fated Marian was
committed
to her parent earth, when Renfew,
Dorcas
,
and Lydia removed to the
seat
of the Earl of
Landaff, where in a
short
time
she
reaped the full
reward of her filial duty and unremitting
tenderness
to her mother, by becoming the bride of that
young nobleman. She was the
blessing
of her
parents, the pride and honor of her
husband
, the
friend and
preceptress
of her children, who
repaid
an hundred fold the
pleasure
she
had
conveyed
to Dorcas's
bosom
by
shewing
the
same
duty and affection to her.
Major Renfew
purchased
the cottage where his
wife and children had lived
so
many years, and
kept it in
constant
repair; in the garden he had
two
small
temples erected, one was
almost
hid
from the eye, by thick
spreading
cypress
and
yew trees, round
whose
branches twined the
deadly night-
shade
, and baleful ivy; within was
a tomb of black marble, over which
stood
Humanity
weeping; on the front of the monument
was the following
inscription
:
Hither let the Daughter of Vanity repair,
Look on this
silent
Monitor,
AND REMEMBER
MARIAN!
She was fair and
sweet
as the lily, innocent as the
young lamb, but folly
misled
her, vice betrayed
her, and
misery
closed
the final awful
scene
,
in the Twenty-Third Year
of her Age
.
Beware the voice of flattery, beware the allurements of
wealth, nor
ask
of thy bountiful Creator aught but
HUMILITY, VIRTUE AND CONTENT.
The other temple was built of white marble,
surrounded
by the
most
beautiful flowering
shrubs
and evergreens; within was Peace and
Prosperity
,
thowering their favors on filial piety; above
covered
an Angel with a crown of gold in her
hands, round which was this heavenly
promise
.
Honor thy Parents, and thy Days
shall
be long in the Land.
May this
promise
ever be
present
to the
remembrance
of the fair daughters of Britain!

LETTER VI.
MENTORIA TO THE MISS WINWORTHS.
Still
am I to complain of the
shortness
of
your letters, and receive the trifling
excuse
,
that you have no time. Fye, my dear girls, I am
ashamed
to read
so
very
childish
an apolegy,
your want of time
must
proceed from your own
bad management, for
surely
no rational being
will give more to the
pursuit
of
amusement
than
what might
just
serve
to give a
zest
to retirement;
and, believe me, you will find retirement alone
the
source
of true
happiness
, and promoter of
industry
and
on the contrary, an eager
pursuit
of
fashionable
folly, which
seduces
you under the
semblance
of
pleasure
, always tends to debilitate
the faculties of the mind, and lead you into habits
of
idleness
and indolence at once prejudicial to
your tranquillity and
interest
, not only your
temporal
,
but what is of far more
consequence
, your
spiritual
interest
.
If, my beloved pupils, you cannot find time
once in
several
weeks to write a few lines to a
friend, who regards you with a
tenderness
nearly
maternal; tell me, and tell me truly, I entreat,
how much time you can
spare
to devote each day
to the Creator and giver of all good? Ah! my
young friends, I fear but a little, very little
portion
is allotted for that
service
; yet
trust
me it is
a
service
which cannot be neglected but by the
ungrateful and unthinking. Is there one
moment
of your lives that
passes
unmarked by his
blessings
? Have you not health,
chearfulness
,
friends, and the
most
valuable of all
blessings
, the
power to dry the tear of affliction, to comfort the
widow, protect the orphan,
release
the poor
debtor, and perform all the good works of peace
and mercy?
How
should
your hearts overflow with gratitude
to that God, who thus bountifully
spreads
around
you the means of
happiness
, do not then my dear
children, throw the
blessing
from you, and
continue
squandering
your time, and trifling with
your health 'till the
first
is nearly
spent
, and the
latter irretrievably ruined, and you will awaken
too late to a
just
sense
of your error, when your
mind, evervated by the
weakness
of your frame,
vainly
shall
endeavour in the few remaining years
to regain
those
sources
of mental delight which
ever flow from a proper exertion of the
reasoning
faculties.
D 3
When you were with me, was there ever a
day too long? I hear you readily
answer
no.
Every moment was fully and
pleasantly
employed
;
true, but had we not always time for
reading, writing,
music
, drawing, needle-work,
and every other
amusing
or
useful
employment.
And did we ever, my dear girls,
rise
from the
sweets
of
repose
, or retire to our chambers at
night, without remembering our duty to him
through
whose
mercy alone we enjoyed all
those
blessings
? and certain I am, you were at that
time as happy as it was
possible
for young people
to be; you were blithe as the woodlark,
blooming
as Hebe, and innocent as the dove, who tries
his new fledged wings in little circles round its
mother's
nest
.
Think not, my young friends, that I
wish
to
deprive you of innocent
amusement
, far from it.
In the
sphere
where it has
pleased
providence to
place you, it is certainly right that you
should
partake in moderation of all the
diversions
of the
metropolis; but if
those
diversions
are too
frequently
repeated, they
lose
their effect, and
you return from them weary,
disgusted
and
dissatisfied
.
But how different are the
pleasures
arising
from
the
amusement
to be found within
ourselves
.
The
pursuit
of either of the fine arts, the
study
of nature, in all her varieties and beauties, the
excellencies
of
christianity
, the delights
arising
from
benevolencehere are
inexhaustible
sources
of
entertainment, rational
sublime
pleasure
, that the
farther you
pursue
it, the more enchanting
appears
the
prospect
, new charms
arise
to your
astonished
view; and though the joys of youth
transiently
fleet away, you will
still
have
pleasures
within your reach, that can render old age not
only
easy
to
yourself
, but delightful to others.
I am no
stranger
to the many enticements
youth and inexperience meet with in the gay
world to allure them from the paths of
reason
. I
myself
spent
my youth in London, but it was
my lot to be placed in a family, where nothing
was deemed
pleasure
, however
specious
its
appearance
,
that was not
sanctioned
by
reason
.
Your grandmother, my dear girls, was a
woman
remarkable for the elegance of her manners
and the
chearfulness
of her
disposition
; yet
believe
me
she
was as truly pious as a primitive
christian
. Surrounded with affluence,
she
was
humble, benevolent, tender hearted, and
easy
of
access
to the
meanest
petitioner. In affliction
resigned
, patient and uncomplaining.
When it was
first
my happy fate to be taken
under her protection,
she
was
scarcely
twenty-
six
years old, extremely lovely in her
person
,
endowed
with every
accomplishment
, admired
wherever
she
appeared,
respected
by her friends,
and adored by her
husband
: yet
she
was not
tainted by vanity, but made it her
study
to
conciliate
esteem
, when love and admiration
should
be no more. She paid a
strict
attention to her
domestic
affairs, attended
personally
to the
morals
and education of her children, never
suffered
an hour to
pass
unemployed, or a day without
paying her devotion to her maker.
This is an example I could
wish
you to
follow
,
as it cannot fail of making you as truly
happy, as it is
possible
for human nature to be.
MENTORIA.
LETTER VII.
FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.
And
so
you really feel
yourselves
mightily
offended
because
your father thinks of a
second
marriage, when you
should
rather rejoice
to find he has
chosen
so
amiable a woman as Mrs.
Clairville.
You are to
consider
that it is more than
probable
in a few years you will all of you be
settled
in a matrimonial way,and then how extremely
uncomfortable
will your father find
himself
, after
being
so
long
accustomed
to the
society
of an
amiable woman, to feel
himself
at once deprived
of it, how
solitary
would be his
house
, how
pensive
his
breakfast
hours.
But you cry, you do not like a
step
-mother.
Can you
suppose
that Mrs. Clairville will
assume
any improper authority overyou, when
she
becomes
Lady Winworth?
Believe me, my children, while you behave
with
tenderness
and propriety towards her,
she
will never appear
otherwise
than your friend
and companion.
Besides
, you
should
reflect that
your father having
discharged
his duty towards
you, by giving you a liberal education, and
remaining
unmarried till you have attained to years
of maturity, has now an undoubted right to
please
himself
, and
chuse
a companion
suited
to
his age and
disposition
.And
shall
you, the
children
of his affection,
whose
happiness
he has
so
much
studied
,
whose
felicity is the
first
wish
of his
heart,
shall
you ungratefully murmur at his choice,
and by your
discontent
embitter the life of him
it is your duty to love and reverence.
No, no.I think my dear girls know too well
the many obligations they are under to this dear
father, to attempt any thing which would be
prejudicial
to his
happiness
.
Consider
, my dear girls,
how much it will be your
interest
to endeavour
to conciliate the affection and
esteem
of the
woman
whom your father thinks proper to place in
so
respectable
a
situation
. You
must
regard her
as the
representative
of your
deceased
parent,
and by tender
assduity
and attention, make her
your
sincere
friend;
such
a conduct will make
you dearer than ever to the heart of your father,
and a delightful tranquillity will
diffuse
itself
through your own
bosoms
,
conscious
that to the
utmost
of your power you have performed your
duty.
Perhaps you may tell me, there is no actual
duty due to a
step
-mother. I
confess
it is not
so
much a duty incumbent for you to obey the
commands or
submit
implicitly to the will of
any but your natural parent, but remember my
fair friends, if you voluntarily perform an exalted
action, where perhaps it was not expected, and
could not be demanded, how much more will it
redound to your honor, than the
simple
discharge
of an obligation.
I am
sensible
that many young women have
been rendered extremely unhappy by their
father's
choosing
second
wives, but then it has been
the error of judgment in his choice; where
passion
has
so
blinded him that he could not
discover
the faults of the
person
who had attracted his
affection
.
Perhaps
she
has been ignorant,
ill-natured
,
illiberal, or
fantastic
; nay, it has been
the unhappy fate of
some
girls to have for a
step
-mother, a
person
in whom all
those
disagreeable
circumstances
are combined. But what a
different choice has your father made, Mrs.
Clairville
is elegant,
accomplished
, gentle and
unassuming
.
She will render your father's evening
of life like the parting rays of a mild autumn
day, where though we cannot but
see
the
visible
approach of winter, there is
such
a
sost
serenity
,
such
various beauties
scattered
over the
prospect
,
that the reflecting mind cannot but prefer it to the
more gaudy tints that
embellish
the appearance
of
spring
.
Your own
selicity
too may be augmented by
this union, as I am certain, however vanity or
folly may for a moment
mislead
your
understanding
,
you will all
sincerely
rejoice in an event
that will ultimately tend to
insure
the
most
refined
pleasure
to
so
good,
so
valuable a father, as
Lord Winworth, by uniting him to a woman,
whose
highly cultivated
understanding
renders her
at once the chearful rational companion, and the
disinterested
friend.
You may remember, my dear girls, how
unkind
you thought me, when I
positively
refused
to accompany you to London; perhaps you may
now perceive the
justice
of that
refusal
. Had
I complied with the polite invitation of your
father
,
and yielded my own better judgment to
your
pressing
entreaties, I
should
have
undoubtedly
long ago forfeited, in your opinion, all
right to your affection.
Some years before Lord Winworth beheld your
truly amiable mother, he
so
far humbled
himself
as to make me a tender of his hand and fortune. I
will not dwell on the
reason
that urged me to
refuse
an offer
so
very far above my
deserts
,
least
my dear
Miss
Winworths
should
think I
boasted
of my great fortitude and
resolution
; believe me,
it was only an exertion of
reason
, and I felt amply
compensated
for all I
suffered
in this
self
-denial,
(for I will not deny that my heart pleaded
strongly
in your father's favor) by the reflection that
I had acted with honour and propriety, and
evinced the
sincerity
of my gratitude to my dear
benefactress
.
Affections that have been deeply
impressed
on
our hearts in extreme youth, are often revived
again at the remote period of mature age, and I
feared to
lose
the
friendship
of my young friends,
by awakening in the
bosom
of their father the
tenderness
he once honored me with, by
professing
.
Before I drop this
subject
, I will give you two
instances
that have fell under my own immediate
knowledge, to
shew
you how very
possible
it is
for an
obstinate
misjudging child to trifle away
both her own and father's
happiness
, by being
wilfully
blind to the merits of his
second
wife; and
also
shew
how truly amiable the daughter
must
appear, who makes the tranquillity of her parent
her chief
study
; and if her own peace is in
some
measure
interrupted by the caprice of a
step
mother
,
she
will
seek
in
resignation
, piety and
humility
,
a
sweet
consolation
and comfort.
Vol. II. E
Celia Markham had the misfortune to
lose
her
mother at the early age of twelve. Mr.
Markham
was doatingly fond of his daughter, he
placed his chief felicity in the hope of one day
seeing
her the
most
amiable,
accomplished
and
happy girl in England.
He had placed her at an eminent boarding
school
, but he knew too much of the world to
suppose
, a girl of her volatile
disposition
,
especially
when
she
was lovely in her
person
, and
reputed
heiress
to a large fortune, could be
so
safe
any where as under the immediate
protection
of a father. He had no female relation
whom he could with propriety invite to his
house
, and he thought he could not do his
daughter
a more acceptable
service
, than by
choosing
the amiable
Miss
Nelson
to
preside
in the place
of her departed mother.
Miss
Nelson
was at that time upwards of thirty,
she
had rendered
herself
universally
beloved and
respected
by all who knew her, for the innate
goodness
of her heart was
conspicuous
in every
action. She had received a
most
liberal education,
and her mental endowments were far
superior
to
the generality of what is termed
accomplished
womenyet
so
timid and
unassuming
in her
manners, that
those
with whom
she
conversed
by
degrees
discovered
her excellencies, and after
some
years acquaintance would be daily finding
something
new to admire. She had by the
most
exemplary conduct as a daughter, convinced the
world what might be expected from her as a
wife and mother. She was uniformly humane,
pious and gentle; in
person
attractive, and in
manners elegantly
simple
.
Such was the woman whom Mr. Markham
thought would help to form the manners,
cultivate
the
understanding
, and direct the
studies
of
his darling Celia.
Miss
Markham no
sooner
was informed of her
father's intended union, than
she
conceived the
most
violent and ill founded
dislike
toward the
innocent object of his affection.
As Celia was
so
young, Mr. Markham never
had an idea of
consulting
her on his
proposed
marriage
,
having therefore obtained from
Miss
Nelson
leave to name an early day for the ceremony,
he wrote to his daughter an affectionate letter,
informing her how much he had
studied
her
happiness
in providing her
so
amiable a friend and
preceptress
, at the
same
time
requesting
her
governess
to prepare her to be
present
at the
wedding
.
E 2
Celia was a girl of high
spirits
, her
understanding
had remained entirely uncultivated, while
large
sums
had been expended on the far
less
necessary
superficial
accomplishments
of
music
,
dancing
,
drawing, and fancy works. Religion
she
knew but by name; it is true, there were prayers
read twice a-day in the
school
, and
she
went with
the other ladies regularly to church twice every
Sunday, but there it
rested
! There had been no pains
taken to
instil
into her mind a true knowledge
of what religion meant;
she
had not been taught
that to keep her
passions
under the controul of
reason
, to
submit
, without repining, to the will
of
those
whom heaven had placed over her; to be
meek, merciful, and
just
, and let every action of
her life be a continued work of gratitude to
heaven
,
and good will to her fellow creatures, was
to follow the precepts of true piety.
She had been early taught to value
herself
,
upon the trifling advantages of birth and fortune,
for
she
saw
the
visible
difference between the
attention
and
respect
paid by her
governess
and the
teachers to
herself
and
those
young ladies who
had neither of
those
advantages to recommend
them.
She was naturally vain, and that vanity was
augmented by the
constant
adulation which
she
daily received from
those
girls,
whose
meanness
of
spirit
induced them to cringe to her
superior
wealth.
From
constantly
contemplating
those
fancied
endowments,
she
began to imagine
she
was born
for
universal
sway
, had
settled
it in her own mind,
that in a few years
she
should
be called home to
preside
at her father's table, have the
management
of the family, and partake of all the
fashionable
pleasures
with which the metropolis
abounds.
How great then was her
disappointment
when
she
found all
these
pleasing
expectations at once
frustrated
when
she
found
she
was to be
still
considered
as a child, and under the controul of the
most
dreaded of all characters, a
step
-mother.
She knew
Miss
Nelson
, but far from admiring
her amiable qualities,
she
had
considered
her as a
dull,
precise
, infipid old maid. She had no idea that
chearfulness
and unaffected piety
constantly
inhabited
the
same
breast
, nor could
she
conceive
that rational
conversation
,
study
,
useful
employment
,
and innocent
amusement
, could amply
diversify
the
scene
, and be a
source
of tranquil
happiness
without the aid of public entertainments,
dress
, parade and folly.
E 3
It may be
easily
conceived, that two tempers
so
diametrically
opposite
would never agree.
Mr. Markham had
seen
these
erroneous traits
in his daughter's
disposition
, but he flattered
himself
, the amiable example and
condescending
behaviour of
Miss
Nelson
would
so
far
operate
on her temper, as to make her love and
endeavour
to imitate her virtues.
It is
impossible
to
describe
the rage and grief
that
displayed
itself
in the countenance of Celia,
on the receipt of her father's letters, regarding
only what
she
foolishly
imagined would be
prejudicial
to her own
happiness
. She gave vent to her
passion
in the
most
unbecoming terms, called her
father cruel,
unjust
and unfeeling, and vowed
she
would die
sooner
than call
Miss
Nelson
mother.
I will go to the wedding,
said
she
,
because
that
woman
shall
not have a moment's
happiness
of
which it is in my power to deprive her.
With this
laudable
resolution
she
sat
forward
for her father's
house
, where upon being tenderly
embraced by him,
instead
of returning a cordial
salute
, and
wishing
him joy,
she
turned her face
from him and
bursting
into tears, (which
proceeded
more from
passion
than
sensibility
)
said
she
was
sorry
to find her dear mother was
so
soon
forgot.
Not forgot, my beloved; replied Mr.
Markham
,
for I have
sought
a woman who is her
counter-part
in every amiable quality.
They then proceeded to church, where, after
the ceremony was performed, tears and
sullen
curtseys
were all the gratulations Celia offered to her
new mother.
Mrs. Markham was naturally a woman of great
sensibility
,
she
attributed Celia's melancholy to a
cause
that did honour to her own heart, and
instead
of taking offence, endeavoured to
soothe
and entertain her during the whole day. But
alas! the gentle Mrs. Markham knew not
the difficulty of the
task
she
had undertaken.
She had known Celia
some
years before her
mother's death, and always thought her an
amiable
,
lively girl, and judging of her
disposition
by that of her parents, imagined there
would be no difficulty in modelling her
according
to her own
wishes
.
But
these
sallacious
hopes were
soon
no more.
Celia from the day of her father's marriage took
every opportunity in her power to thwart and vex
her mother-in-law.
Though Mrs. Markam was a woman of too
much
sense
, to let the caprice of
such
a girl ruffle
the uncommon
serenity
of her temper, yet was
it totally
impossible
for a woman of her
exquisite
sensibility
, to enjoy any tolerable degree
of
happiness
while
she
saw
the darling child of
the man
she
loved and
esteemed
of
so
sroward
and
perverse
a
disposition
.
Celia was volatile, and
thoughtless
to
excess
,
fond of company, and
so
entirely unqualified to
amuse
or entertain
herself
, that the
most
improper
society
was preferred to being alone. Her
mother-in-law
was of too grave and rational a turn
to afford her any
pleasure
by her
conversation
,
and to read or work required
so
much attention,
that
she
termed it fatigue.
It was with infinite regret that Mr. Markham
discovered
the little felicity he was like to enjoy
in this
second
union. He
saw
the child of his
tenderest
affection
restless
and
discontented
; he
saw
with
anguish
the many
fruitless
endeavours of
Mrs. Markham to reclaim and make her
pursue
the direct road to
happiness
.
Whenever the tender attention of this amiable
woman lead her to
remonstrate
with Celia on the
impropriety of her conduct, and the
miserable
waste
of her time, the petulant girl would
burst
into tears, and cry, Oh! that my dear mother
was living, I
should
not then be treated thus
cruelly
,
and abridged of every innocent
pleasure
,
by a woman, who having
stolen
from me my dear
father's affections, now
usurps
an undue authority
over both him and me.
These
continual
disputes
greatly embittered
Mrs. Markham's life.Mr. Markham was at a
loss
how to conduct
himself
so
as to give pain
to neither wife or daughter. In
short
, the whole
family was unhappy from the capricious
behaviour
of her,
whose
chief
study
should
have been
to promote their felicity.
Celia had her friends, her parties, and her
secrets
, in which Mrs. Markham was not allowed
to participate; the
consequence
was, that
she
at
a very early age had her lovers
also
.
Among the many candidates for her favor was
a Captain
Parslow
, he was a man of no fortune,
ignorant, conceited, and a complete coxcomb.
He
soon
discovered
the
weakness
of Celia, he
flattered her foibles, took her part
against
her
mother-in-law
,
and, in
short
,
so
far won on the
foolish
thoughtless
girl, that
she
consented
to elope
with him, and take a trip to Scotland.
By the dropping of a letter Mrs. Markham
discovered
the plan;
she
talked to Celia in the
accents of
friendship
and fond
solicitude
, but
received
in return, only impertinence and
disrespect
.
Mrs. Markham thought it her duty to acquaint
her
husband
with the
discovery
she
had made.
Grieved to the
soul
, he
sent
for his daughter, and
in the
most
pathetic terms entreated her to
desist
from
so
fatal a
step
.
The artful Celia thought this was the time to
alienate her father's affections from his wife
she
positively
denied the whole charge, and declared
she
believed it
must
be a contrivance of Mrs.
Markham's; begged if her dear father thought
her capable of
such
imprudence, he would
send
her abroad, and
shut
her in a convent. I
know, continued
she
, with well
dissembled
tears,
that you have been taught to
consider
your poor
girl as an abandoned wretch, who
consulted
only
her own
happiness
, but indeed, indeed my
beloved
father, you have been deceived. I am not
the guilty creature you think me. But, alas! I
have long
seen
my
presence
is a bar to your
happiness
,
send
me from you, then, dear Sir;
since
it is
impossible
we can both enjoy content, let
me be the victim, and may your felicity be
unbounded
.
This artful
speech
had the
desired
effect, and
Mr. Markham believing his daughter perfectly
innocent, began to treat the woman with
coolness
whom he imagined had attempted to create
dissention
between him and his only child.
Celia
saw
she
had now completely made her
mother-in-law unhappy, and exulted in her
cruelty
,
adding
insult
to the already poignant
sufferings
of the patient and amiable Mrs. Markham.
But Celia had not
sufficient
art to elude or
evade the
solicitude
of her admirer.
Parslow
still
continued his devoirs, and
Miss
Markham
listened
to his
slattery
and received his
assiduities
with too
much
pleasure
to give any room for
despair
; in a
short
time
she
eloped. Her father was amazed,
and how much was his
astonishment
increased
when the following letter was put into his hand.
DEAR AND HONORED SIR,
Though
the
step
I have taken will, I am
certain, by the generality of mankind, be
called an improper one, my own heart acquits
me of any motive but a
wish
to
insure
your
happiness
.
I have long
seen
, with
sincere
anguish
of heart,
how much my
presence
militated
against
your
tranquillity. I am convinced, my dear father,
Mrs. Markham is now the only
objesct
of your
affection; your once tenderly beloved child has
only a
secondary
place in your heart.
Pardon me, my revered parent, if I
say
, this
was too evident not to be
discovered
, and when
once
discovered
, too painful to be borne in
silence
.
The contempt which Mrs. Markham's
unjust
suspicions
subject
me to, not only from our
acquaintance
,
but even our
servants
, has urged
me to make choice of a protector for my
same
and
honor, nor do I
scruple
to add, a protector from
her
undeserved
malice and continual ill-nature.
Adieu, my dear father, may you be as happy
as I
wish
you; forgive and think with
compassion
on your child,
CELIA MARKHAM.
The feelings of a father on the receipt of
such
a letter are more
easily
conceived than
described
.
He had long
considered
his innocent wife as a
person
who had
disturbed
the peace of his family,
and now that he imagined
himself
convinced of
her
unjust
conduct towards his daughter, his
displeasure
knew no bounds; rage, invective, and
bitter reproach, were all the gentle, meek,
uncomplaining
sufferer
, received from a
husband
who once fondly
esteemed
her. But though Mrs.
Markham complained not, the
distress
of her
mind preyed upon her delicate frame,
she
sunk
under this unexpected misfortune, and a rapid
decline in a few months put a period to her
existence
.
In the mean time Celia and her
husband
had
been received and forgiven by Mr. Markham;
but, alas! that too indulgent father
soon
discovered
,
that in the
loss
of his wife, he had been
bereft of every earthly comfort; his daughter
rather
triumphed in, than endeavoured to
soothe
his melancholy
she
threw out the
most
illiberal
censures
on the memory of the
deceased
Mrs.
Markham, and having no longer any particular
end to attain by pretending violent affection to
her father,
she
at
first
began to
slight
and at length
totally neglected him.
He felt, acutely felt, her
unkindness
, but
still
his affection led him to
lavish
immense
sums
to
support
the extravagance of
herself
and
husband
,
till unable any longer to keep them from ruin, he
gave up all but about one hundred pounds a year,
with which he retired into the country, and ended
his days in what he called
peaceful
obscurity
.
And to the
last
his prayers were offered at the
throne of grace for his ungrateful childbut alas!
Vol. II. F
Celia, by her own conduct counteracted the effects
of
those
pious prayers. Neglected, nay
despised
,
by her
husband
,
she
launched into every
species
of
dissipation
, and was in a few years reduced to a
state
of
absolute
penury, where
remorse
is not the
least
painful of her many heavy afflictions, all which
she
has brought on
herself
by an illiberal
obstinate
conduct; for had
she
rightly
considered
the virtues
and amiable deportment of Mrs. Markham,
she
might have contributed to the
selicity
of her
father
,
and, in the end, ultimately
insured
her
own.
How different was the behaviour of Screna
But as my letter is already of a
considerable
length,
I
shall
reserve
her
story
'till the next
post
.
Adieu, my beloved pupils, once more believe
me, to be completely happy
yourselves
, you
must
study
the
happiness
of all with whom you are
connected
;
for there is more real
pleasure
flows from
the reflection of having promoted the welfare and
tranquillity of a fellow creature, than can proceed
from the
highest
self
gratifications the world can
afford. The one is like a
transient
vapour that
for a moment illumines the
sky
,
passes
and is
forgotten
;
but the other, like the glorious
sun
, glads
the whole face of nature, by its enlivening beams
through the day, and even lends its rays to the
silver
moon, to chear the horrors of approaching
night. So does the remembrance of good actions
gild the day of life, and chear the heavy night of
approaching death.
God
bless
you, my dear girls, believe my
friendship
sincere
and unchangeable, while life's
warm fluid animates the heart of
MENTORIA.

LETTER VIII.
FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.
I have
taken up my pen, without farther
preface to proceed on my
promised
story
, and
shall
leave my dear
Miss
Winworths to apply the
moral
themselves
;
sensible
that they do not want
sense
to
discover
right from wrong, and
sincerely
hoping they will not let folly, vanity, or illiberal
prejudices
mislead
their judgment.
Mr.
Osborne
was left a widower at a very
early age, with only one daughter, named Serena,
who, when
she
had the misfortune to
lose
her
mother, was
scarcely
three years old. She
inherited
by the death of her mother, a genteel
independence
,
and was reputed
heiress
to her father's
fortune, which was not
inconsiderable
.
Not long after this melancholy event Mr.
Osbore
, being on a
visit
to a friend in the country,
became acquainted with
Miss
Withers.
She was, it
must
be
confessed
, beautiful in the
extreme, but that acknowledged, and there was
not another favorable
circumstance
to be
mentioned
in her behalf. She was the daughter of
a man who enjoyed in a country town, a
considerable
and lucrative
post
under government; his
wife had brought him four or five
thousand
pounds,
which had been accumulated by her father, who
regarded not the cries of the
fatherless
, or the
tears of the widow.
This woman's education had been
such
as might
be expected for the child of a poor petty-fogging
lawyer, who by dint of chicanery and dirty
employment
,
was
scraping
a little
sordid
dross
together
,
and thought by leaving her a fortune, he
left her every
necessary
recommendation to
secure
her advancement in life; the
consequence
was,
that to the
most
illiberal contracted ideas and
consummate
ignorance,
she
added the pride and
self
conceit of a
first
-rate woman of
fashion
;
she
was
extravagantly fond of
dress
, parade, and
show
;
but had no idea of any difference being
necessary
between the education of a gentlewoman, and that
of a
tradesman
's or farmer's daughter.
Brought up under
such
a mother, with
such
consined
notions,
Miss
Withers had been taught
to believe that the good
housewife
and
accomplished
F 3
woman, were one and the
same
thing.
She perfectly
understood
the art of cookery,
pickling
,
preserving
, and all the long &c's.
necessary
to form a complete
house
-keeper.
She could work tent-
stitch
, tambour, and
titch">stitch
, tambour, and
cross-stitch
,
make all her father's, and indeed, all the
family linen, knew the
cheapest
ways of going
to market, how to
scold
and keep her
servants
in
order; in
short
, had been brought up as a
complete
Mrs. Notable
.
But to the fine arts
she
was a perfect
stranger
.
Music
, dancing, or drawing, had no charms for
her, nor had
she
the
least
idea of the
pleasures
resulting
from a well informed, elegantly
cultivated
mind. Haughty, yet mean; ignorant, yet
obstinate
in her opinion, however
absurd
, and
deaf to the voice of conviction.
She had been educated in the
strictest
principles
of
methodism
, yet was
she
of no fixed religion,
having been wearied in her youth by being too
rigidly obliged to conform to her parents
manners
;
she
contracted a
dislike
to her religious
duties
,
and at the time Mr.
Osborne
first
saw
her,
was of no particular fect whatever.
She had, by the death of her mother, who had
been extremely anxious to make her dear Jemima
a fortune,
just
come to the
possession
of ten
thousand
pounds, and was
so
insinuatiug
in her
manner
,
that
she
was
universally
well received in all
companies, and called one of the
best
kind of
girls in the world.
Mr.
Osborne
was captivated with her lovely
person
and
specious
manners, and having made
proposals
to her guardians, was accepted, and the
lady, in due time, became Mrs.
Osborne
.
She had from the
first
of her acquaintance
pretended
a violent attachment to the little Serena,
I
say
pretended,
because
I have been
since
convinced
she
regarded her with an eye of envy and
ill-nature from the moment
she
became her
mother-in-law
.
In about twelve months Mrs.
Osborne
presented
her
husband
with a little girl, and
solemnly
declared, at the time of her birth, it was
impossible
for her to love any child better than
she
did Serena; and that it
should
be her chief
study
to make no difference between the
children
.
This was a declaration I, who was
present
,
was by no means
pleased
with, as I knew it was
not in nature for a woman to love another child
so
well as her own offspringand though a
strong
sense
of duty, and a naturally
compassionate
heart, might lead a woman to treat with the
utmost
tenderness
, a girl, deprived of her
natural
parent, and thrown, as it were, on her
protection
;
yet it was
impossible
but inclination
must
lead her to give the preference to her own
child.
As Serena and Jemima (the name of her little
half-
sister
) grew up, light and
shade
could not
be more
opposite
than their
dispositions
. Serena
was
sensible
, volatile, and chearful, of a bright
genius, fond of the
pursuit
of knowledge, yet
meek, mild and innocent as it was
possible
for a
human being to be.
Jemima was
sullen
, proud,
obstinate
, and
so
stupid
, that it was not in the power of any
masters
whatever to cultivate a mind rendered
impenctrable
by nature.
The excellencies which
discovered
themselves
in the mind and
disposition
of Serena were
so
many faults in the eyes of Mrs.
Osborne
, nor did
she
fail to aggravate every error to which her
volatility
,
or
thoughtless
innocence might betray her,
into crimes,
so
that by degrees her father's
affection
became alienated from her, and it was
almost
impossible
for the poor girl to
speak
, move, or
look
so
as not to give offence. As
she
advanced
towards womanhood, her troubles
increased
her
high
sense
of her religious duties was termed
hypocrisy
her
strong
sensibility
, art; and her fine
taste
, and brilliant genius, follies, which would
in the end lead her to ruin.
When
she
had attained the age of
sixteen
, the
bequest
of a large fortune obliged her father to
visit
Jamaica; he
resolved
to take his family with
him, and had not been there long before Mrs.
Osborne
was
seized
with one of
those
fevers
incident
to the climate.
Tenderly and with the
utmost
care did Serena
watch over her for many months when the
disorder
had left her in a weak emaciated
state
, did
she
never quit her bed-
side
,
administering
every
medicine, nor ever taking
rest
except what
she
procured at intervals on a
matrass
in the
same
apartment
.
And what was the return
she
received?
Pettishness
,
discontent
, and repining. Frequently
did Mrs.
Osborne
ask
, if
she
was brought to that
strange
place to be murderedif it was intended
she
should
be
poisoned
and whether Serena did
not know that the doctor
designed
to kill her;
and
these
expressions
were not the effect of
delirium
,
but
spoken
with a
coolness
and
asperity
that tore the heart of the mild affectionate girl to
whom they were
addressed
.
Mrs.
Osborne
at length recovered, when it
pleased
heaven to take her
husband
from her, and
she
was left involved in a
disagreeable
law
suit
,
which was finally terminated to her
disadvantage
,
she
was
cast
with
costs
of
suit
, and returned to
England with little more than five hundred pounds
remaining.
Now it was that Serena
shewed
herself
to be
the amiable girl I had ever thought her.
When
she
received her fortune,
she
settled
an
handsome
annuity on Mrs.
Osborne
, and divided
the
residue
between Jemima and
herself
; though
at her father's death
she
had been, by their arts,
deprived of any advantage from his fortune, the
whole being by will left to Mrs.
Osborne
and her
daughter, but providence had ordained that they
were not to enjoy it.
To the
last
hour that
she
remained with her
mother-in-law,
she
studied
her
happiness
only,
enough I have been informed it was
seldom
indeed
that
she
received even the
smallest
token of
approbation. Her
society
was
circumscribed
, her
amusements
abridged, her
most
innocent actions
censured
, and the gaiety of her heart
construed
into levity, and reprimanded as vice; nay, after
the alteration in their
circumstances
,
she
was
suffered
to perform the
most
menial offices: in
short
,
my dear girls, her education had been confined,
her genius cramped, and had
she
not been a girl
of an uncommon good heart, her
disposition
must
have been totally perverted by the
constant
restraint
she
lived under, and the
severity
with which
she
was treated; while Jemima was indulged in
idleness
, her faults
glossed
over, and her
perverse
haughty
disposition
called laudable pride. Yet
did I never hear that Serena ever
used
an
unbecoming
expression
to her mother, or made any
complaint of
unkindness
.
She has been now for
some
years married to a
deserving
man, and
still
continues to treat Mrs.
Osborne
with the
highest
respect
, and her
daughter
with affection, though the ingratitude of
Jemima
often appears, by her unkind neglect of
a
sister
who
sacrificed
her own
interest
to the
unterest
and
happiness
of her mother.
Serena, though happy in her matrimonial
connection
,
is not in affluent
circumstances
.
Jemima is lately married to a man of large
fortune
,
and removed to a
distant
part of England,
where
she
can
seldom
find time to write to her
sister
, and when
she
does
so
far
condescend
, it is
with
such
apparent
carelessness
,
coldness
, and
distance
, that the warm heart of Serena is chilled
by the
perusal
of her letters; yet will I venture
to affirm Serena the happier woman of the
two.
I happened to mention one day the unmerited
treatment
she
had received, not only from them,
but from her other relations; and mark, my dear
girls, the
answer
I received.
Were I to
say
their
unkindness
did not give
me pain, I
should
be guilty of
falsehood
,
because
I have that warm affection in my heart, which
expands it with brotherly love towards all my
fellow
creatures, and never yet breathed a
wish
to
the
disadvantage
of a
single
individual. I mourn
their afflictions, and rejoice in their
prosperity
.
I am therefore,
conscious
of not
deserving
their
unkindness
, and wrapt in the integrity of my own
heart, from my
soul
pity the
bosom
that can
harbour
malice or ill will towards any one.
Thus, my dear
Miss
Winworths, you
see
how
much our own
happiness
depends on our
strenuously
cultivating
such
philanthropy of temper as
may lead us to regard
ourselves
but as
secondary
objects; the felicity we promote for others will
return with double force to our own
bosoms
, and
conscious
of having always regarded our fellow
creatures as
ourselves
, we can look up with
confidence
to that good providence who will never
forsake
the children of obedience.
Adieu!
Your friend in
sincerity
,
MENTORIA.
N. B. Soon after this
last
letter Lord Winworth was married to
Mrs. Clairville, and the young ladies conducting
themselves
according
to the advice of their amiable friend, Mentoria, found in the
new-made
Lady Winworth, every engaging quality that could be
desired
,
to form the polite agreeable companion, the affectionate parent, and
sincere
friend. The
correspondence
between Mentoria and her
pupils
was continued for many years, but as the publication of the
whole would render this work too
extensive
,
besides

LETTER IX.
MENTORIA TO MISS G. WINWORTH.
I address
myself
singly
to you, my dear
Gertrude,
because
the delicacy of your
present
situation
demands my
serious
attention, and
calls up all my
tenderness
.
I am
inexpressibly
pleased
to find you have
made choice of
so
worthy a man as Sir Arthur
Fitzgerald, and that your father approves the
object
of your
selection
.
I think you have acted like a woman of
sense
and prudence, and I make no doubt but you will
preserve
the
same
propriety of conduct when a
wife, as has evidently
characterised
you while
single
.
I admire that real delicacy which impelled you
to give an immediate
dismission
to all
those
pretenders
who
solicited
your hand without being
able to influence your heart in their favor. There
cannot be a more
despicable
passion
than that
insatiable
thirst
for admiration, which leads a
woman
to encourage
indiscriminately
the forward
advances of every coxcomb, who
shall
pay them
the
incense
of flattery, and be continually
spreading
their lures to attract adulation, however in
their hearts they may
despise
the
person
who
offers
it.
I am
sensible
, my dear Gertrude will pardon
me, if anxious for her future
happiness
, I venture
to give her my advice and opinion for the
preservation
of her felicity in the married
state
; it has
often been remarked, that a heart is much
easier
gained than kept, and, believe me, it is a very
judicious
observation
.
There requires more care, attention, and
solicitude
,
from the wife to the
husband
, than from
the
mistress
to her adoring lover. The lover
being
but
seldom
with you,
sees
you only in part,
it is natural to
suppose
you would neither appear
before him in a
slatternly
dress
, or with a
peevish
aspect
. Your clothes will be always put on with
neatness
, and your face
dressed
in
smiles
. On
the contrary, the
husband
being always in your
company, has an opportunity of
discovering
every
little defect or
blemish
in your
person
, manners,
or
disposition
, and the chief
study
of a wife
should
G 2
be to guard
against
every thing that might create
distaste
, or excite
disgust
.
And in the
first
place let me recommend a
most
scrupulous
regard to delicacy and
neatness
.
Many young women
foolishly
imagine, as
soon
as they are married, they have a right to
understand
and laugh at an indelicate
allusion
, but from
this fault, the native purity of your mind will, I
am certain,
preserve
you,
since
nothing but
extreme
ignorance or levity could lead any woman
to
listen
with apparent
pleasure
, to an improper
tale, or ill timed
jest
.
There are too many men, nay, even among
those
who call
themselves
gentlemen, who will
not
scruple
to
shock
a woman's ears with
conversation
of this kind; but the look of marked
disapprobation
and
silent
contempt, will never fail to
silence
them,
unless
they are either brutes or
fools, and to
such
there is no fear of your being
exposed
.
The next thing is
neatness
in your
person
and
dress
and an equanimity of temper to be
preserved
towards your
husband
, and your
servants
;
nothing degrades a gentlewoman more than her
suffering
her temper to be
so
far ruffled as to
use
improper language to her dependants, nor can
any thing be more
disgusting
to a man of
sense
than to
see
his wife give way to
sudden
starts
of
passion
.
To every relation and friend of your
husband
,
shew
a polite attention and marked preference;
shew
him, that to be related to, or
esteemed
by
him, is a
sufficient
claim upon your regard
whatever be his errors, confine the knowledge
of them to your own
bosom
, and endeavour, by
the
mildest
persuasions
, to lead him to the path
of rectitude.
Discretion
must
direct you as to
the proper
season
to offer your advice and opinions,
since
men in general are
so
tenacious of their
prerogative
,
that they
start
from every thing that
has the
least
appearance of controul or
opposition
.
Never attempt to
restrain
his
pleasures
;
if he
should
be
sond
of company,
dissipation
and
expensive
amusements
, be it your
study
to
detach
his mind from
those
pursuits
, by
endeavouring
to render his home delightful, let your face be
ever arrayed in
smiles
at his approach, form a
society
of
those
he loves and
esteems
most
, exert
your various abilities to charm and entertain him,
and believe me, he who
constantly
meets
chearfulness
and
smiles
at home, will
seldom
wish
to
seek
abroad for
pleasure
.
Above all things never
suffer
any
person
to
speak
disrespectfully
of him in your
presence
, and
G 3
guard your heart from the
least
approach of
jealousy
;
should
there even be
occasion
for
suspicion
,
be careful not to let him
see
you have
discovered
his
dishonorable
conduct, and never
suffer
any one, more
especially
a
man
, to hear you
complain.
Avoid reproaches, they in general
increase
rather
than alleviate the
distress
; if patient
suffering
and the mild
remonstrance
of an afflicted
uncomplaining
spirit
, will not work a reformation,
reproach and
discontent
will have no effect.
You
must
not be above attending to his
interest
so
far as may lead you to
inspect
the expences of
your family; have
stated
and regular times for
examining your
house
-keeper's accounts, and
being
satisfied
that your trades-people are regularly
paid; and do not let trifles put you
aside
from this
very
necessary
point.
Let your own expences be regulated by
prudence
void of
parsimony
, and
suffer
not a
passion
for finery, and a
wish
to
eclipse
your
acquaintance
,
prompt you to
overstep
your income, or
deprive you of the
inexpressible
pleasure
of
relieving
indigent merit.
Though I would not have you
sacrifice
too
largely at the
shrine
of that idol,
fashion
, I would
have you follow her
so
far as may make your
appearance
alway
deserve
the appellation of
elegantly
neat; nor
must
you confine this
appearance
only to your going abroad or receiving
company
at home; though you were to be in the
country for months, and
see
none but your
husband
and
servants
, never neglect the real
necessary
duties of the toilet, it is a
respect
due to
him, it
shews
a
wish
to appear agreeable in his
eyes, and that you prefer his approbation to that
of all the world
beside
.
There is one more
circumstance
I
must
mention
,
although a thorough knowledge of your
disposition
renders it
almost
unnecessary
; yet I have
seen
so
many couples made
inexpressibly
miserable
by it, that I cannot
resist
my inclination to
warn you of
so
dangerous a conduct.
Never permit any man, however clothed with
the
mask
of
friendship
, to treat you with
familiarity
.
There are many freedoms, which to a
girl may be perfectly innocent, and yet become
almost
crimes when offered to, or received by a
married woman.
A married woman
should
never
suffer
a man
to entertain her in a
strain
of gallantry, a
pressure
of the hand is an affront, and an attempt at a
salute
(except where the
nearness
of the relation
authorises
such
a liberty) is, and
should
be
resented
as an
insult
.
There is a decent gravity of manner that will
at once excite admiration and
respect
, and yet
exclude
all improper familiarity, nor can any thing
be more ridiculous, than to
see
the
mistress
of a
family
,
perhaps the mother of four or five children,
affecting a giddy flirting carriage, that would be
hardly
excusable
in a girl of
sixteen
it may, in
some
instances
, proceed from an innocent gaiety
of heart, but it hardly ever fails of degenerating
into levity and imprudence, always lays a woman
open to
insult
, of which
she
cannot complain,
because
she
evidently invited it; and too often
ends in the total
loss
of honor,
happiness
, and
reputation
.
Be chearful,
condescending
, and polite to
all, but let there ever be that dignity in your
manner which may keep
impertinent fools
, or
designing
villains
at a proper
distance
.
Pardon the length of this
epistle
, and believe
it proceeds from a friend who loves you.
Remember
me affectionately to your dear
sisters
.
Adieu, may every
blessing
be your portion here
and hereafter.
MENTORIA.
LETTER X.
MENTORIA TO LADY FITZGERALD.
The
news that you were
safe
in bed, and
mother
to a daughter, my dear Gertrude, will,
believe me, give as much
satisfaction
to my heart,
as any
sublunary
pleasure
possibly
can; and,
weak as I am, tottering as it were on the very
brink of a
vast
eternity, I cannot
resist
the
desire
I feel, of once more writing to my beloved pupils,
for in
addressing
Lady Fitzgerald, I
suppose
myself
also
writing to her
sisters
.
But
first
a few words to
yourself
, in regard to
this dear, this precious little charge, with which
it has
pleased
heaven to
entrust
you. May it ever
be
impressed
on your mind that the future
happiness
or
misery
of this child depends greatly
on the treatment
she
receives during her puerile
years.
Let not a too great
fondness
prompt you, by
extreme indulgence, to enervate the faculties of
her
soul
, or pervert her
disposition
, and by
so
doing render her totally unfit to bear the many
inconveniences and
crosses
she
must
necessarily
meet with in her
passage
through life.
And on the contrary, do not, by an ill-judged
severity
, drive her to mean
subterfuges
,
falshoods
and deceit, through fear of your anger.Many
an amiable girl has been totally ruined by
such
treatment; it leads them to fear but not love their
parents, it prompts them to make companions of
their
servants
, and often ends in the entire
perversion
of their principles.
Teach her to fear to
disoblige
you, but let it be
through fear of
losing
your affection, not from
the
apprehension
of
punishment
. Do not be too
anxious to have your child
praised
for an early
progress
in her education; a young mind
should
not be loaded, it
spoils
the memory, and often
occasions
a
dislike
to
study
in more advanced life;
besides
, children
accustomed
to hear
themselves
commended are apt to think
themselves
sufficiently
wise
and
accomplished
before their education
is well begun.
Do not encourage her in a love of finery, or
suffer
her to be told
she
is
handsome
, they will
both be very pernicious to her future
tranquillity
.
There is one thing which parents are very apt,
not only to do
themselves
, but to
suffer
their
servants
to do the
same
; that is, when any little
master
visits
at the
house
nearly of
miss
's age,
she
is told that he is her little
husband
, and that
she
must
hold up her head and behave like a woman,
or
she
will never be married.
Thus is the idea of love and lovers introduced
into ther little hearts, before they are capable of
understanding
what the word means.
This is, to me, the
most
foolish
conduct in the
world, and nothing would offend me
so
soon
, as
having
such
ridiculous things
said
to any child
in
whose
education and future
prospects
I was any
ways concerned. Teach them the difference
between
right and wrong, and convince their
reason
,
by pointing out the real way to promote their
own
happiness
, and merit the regard and
esteem
of their friends.
Do not introduce your girl too early into
public
,
it will give her a
taste
for
dissipation
: in
proper time let her partake in moderation of all
the
amusements
of the metropolis,
so
as to
prevent
the bad effects of
curiosity
ungratified; but
at the
same
time
accustom
her to find
resources
within
herself
, that may, at all times, enable her
to
banish
that
monster
Ennui
.
Trust
not the cultivation of her mental
faculties
,
or the forming of her moral character, to
any one but
yourself
; and as
she
advances towards
womanhood make her your friend and
companion
:
let the
distance
between mother and
daughter
be forgot, and by treating her with a degree
of confidence that flatters her
self
-
consequence
,
encourage her to make your
bosom
the
repository
of all her
secrets
, and be ready to apply to your
better jugment to direct all her actions.
I am certain there would not be half the
imprudencies
committed by girls in general, if they were
not kept at
such
an awful
distance
by their
mothers
;
that fearing either ridicule or reproof, they
dare not
entrust
them with their little plans and
disappointments
, and relying either on the
advice
of
some
one as inexperienced as
themselves
,
or to the
suggestions
of their own
simple
hearts,
they involve
themselves
in troubles, which
endanger
their peace of mind and ruin their
reputation
,
but
so
it will ever be while mothers forget
they have ever been girls
themselves
, and make
no allowance for the volatility of youth, and the
innocent
impulses
of a heart unburthened by the
cares of the world.
I have written much more than I intended, but
the
subject
interested
me, and there is yet another
which dwells
still
nearer my heart, that is, my
beloved Gertrude, the
necessity
there is of giving
your child a proper
sense
of the high advantages
of early piety, but this
must
not be done by
teaching
her to
say
long prayers, of which
she
cannot
comprehend the meaning, or by making her read
books of dull theology.
It is example, my dear friend,
must
teach her
the true principles of the
Christian
Religion; let
her
see
you in the act of devotion, let her
curiosity
be awakened, and then, as you
answer
her
questions
lead her by degrees to love,
worship
and
adore the Almighty giver of all good; convince
her of her dependence on his bounty for food,
raiment, and all the
blessings
of life; teach her to
place her whole confidence in his mercy, to
receive
even the
smallest
blessing
with gratitude, and
to bow under the
heaviest
affliction with patience
and humility.
But above all things, mind that your example
does not contradict you precept. What confidence
can a child place in the religion of its parent,
when the parent lives in direct
opposition
to the
principles of that religion.
Oh! my dear friend, this is the one thing
needful! this the heavenly comforter, that
supports
us through life, and will cheer us in the
hour of death!
Vol. II. H
Our duty is plainly marked and
so
easy
, that
when we do not perform it, we take more pains
to court
misery
, than would
suffice
to make us
truly happy. What can be more
easily
comprehended
even by the
meanest
understanding
.
Do
justly
, love mercy, and walk humbly.
Love thy Creator above all things, and thy neigh
bour as
thyself
! forgive as you hope to be forgiv
en.
And remember,
That with the
same
measure
you mete, the like
shall
be given to you again
.
My dear young friends, think me not too
serious
.
I am old, and
sinking
to the grave, I am
convinced of the
necessity
of living well, if we
hope to die in peace; and
solicitous
for the
welfare
of all dear to the family of Winworth. I
have exerted
myself
to write this, which you
may
consider
as my
last
farewell.
God
preserve
and
bless
you all, may peace
reign in your hearts, and true piety direct your
actions; may you
so
pass
through this
transitory
life, as not to dread the approach of the
messenger
that
shall
convey you to eternal
rest
.
And when, at
last
, Death
shall
your frame
destroy
,
Die by
some
sudden
sudden
of joy;
Peaceful
sleep
out the
sabbath
of the tomb,
And wake to raptures in a life to come.
MENTORIA.
ESSAY ON FEMALE EDUCATION.
It
is much to be lamented, that in the
present
mode of educating females, the
useful
is
entirely
neglected, for the more ornamental and
superficial
accomplishments
.
There was a time, when, if the daughter of
a reputable
tradesman
could read and write good
English
, handle her needle with
neatness
and
celerity, and
understand
both the theory and
practice of good
housewisery
,
she
was thought
perfectly
accomplished
, and
so
indeed
she
was
as
those
qalifications rendered her capable of
undertaking
the management of a family.
But in the
present
refined age, if an
industrious
tradesman
can afford to give his daughter, five
hundred pounds, it is immediately
settled
by
Mamma, that
Miss
must
be
genteelly
educated.
Accordingly
she
is at an early age
sent
to a
boarding-school
,
where
she
learns to jabber bad
French, and
worse
English
; the old-
fashion
sampler
,
and
useful
plain-work are neglected, and
she
is
instructed
how to work fillagree, make
H 2
wafer work, daub
sattin
, and work ill proportioned
figures in cloth, which in due time are
curiously
mounted, and hung round to ornament the
parlour
of the fond but ill judging parents.
Add to
these
accomplishments
the very
fashionable
one of jingling the keys of the
harpsichord
,
with great velocity, though perhaps out of time
and out of tune.
Imagine
Miss
just
returned, at the age of
seventeen
,
her mind puffed up with vanity, and her
head well
stored
with
sensibility
, and all the
delicate feelings to be gleaned from a circulating
library, the contents of which the has eagerly
and
indiscriminately
perused
, without any one
taking the pains to direct her judgment or correct
her
taste
.
We will
suppose
her lovely in her
person
, and
attractive in her manners,
she
comes home, and
is idolized by her too partial mother, and
spoken
of by her father with pride and exultation; but
alas!
she
is too fine a lady to pay any attention
to the
domestic
concerns of the family.
In this
foolish
idea
she
is indulged by the
mother
,
who thinks her dear girl's beauty,
sensibility
,
and
accomplishments
, will undoubtedly
obtain
her a match far
superior
to her
present
station
,
and
she
will have no
occasion
to be a good
housewife
.
But
these
sanguine
wishes
are
seldom
if ever
realized, and we will
suppose
her married to a
man who is
just
entered into a genteel and
improving
line of
business
; her friends think it a good
match, her fortune is an
acquisition
to her
husband
and they enter the career of life with all the hopes
of permanent
happiness
which peace and plenty
can
inspire
.
But what a wretched figure does this elegant
accomplished
girl make, as
mistress
of a family;
her
servants
cheat and laugh at her, her
acquaintance
blame her, and perhaps
she
may incur even
the
censure
of her
husband
, for paying no more
attention to matters which
so
nearly concern
his
interest
.
Has
she
children,
she
knows not how to make
or mend their clothes,
she
is always
surrounded
with difficulties, from which
she
knows not how
to extricate
herself
, and
ashamed
to
confess
her
ignorance to any one who could
instruct
her in the
point
she
requires,
she
becomes
peevish
and
dissatisfied
,
neglects even
those
accomplishments
which
she
formerly
strove
so
hard to attain;
becomes
negligent in her
dress
,
careless
in her
manners
,
and
sinks
into a very blank in the
creation
.
H 3
Her
husband
disappointed
in not
seeing
that
order and regularity at home which he had once
fondly hoped, no longer finds any charms in her
society
, and
seeks
to forget his
disappointment
either in the bottle, or at the gaming table, both
equally
destructive
; and
she
sees
inevitable ruin
approaching, without the
smallest
power to ward
off the blow.
Nor can the whole
universe
present
us with an
object more truly
deserving
our pity, than
such
a woman in a
state
of penury! She is at a
loss
how to perform even the
necessary
duties of life,
she
cannot exert
herself
to obtain even a
single
meal for
herself
or children;
she
pines in
obscurity
,
regretting her
useless
education, and
wishes
that the
sums
so
expended, had been laid by
to
encrease
her fortune, and
she
herself
had been
only
instructed
in
those
things, which would have
tended ultimately to render her a
useful
and
respectable
member of
society
.
But how widely different is the lot of the
happy girl,
whose
parents have, not only by
precept but example, implanted in her mind the
great
necessity
of rendering
herself
useful
, before
the can be
esteemed
valuable--who perfectly
understands
how to manage her family, and
regulate
her
servants
-- who to affability and
chearfulness
,
adds
industry
oeconomy and piety.
Such a woman when
she
marries, however
small
her fortune, brings to her
husband
an
inexhaustible
fund of
treasure
. She is not
ashamed
to
investigate
even the
minutest
concerns of her
family
;
her expences are regulated by the
strictest
rules of frugality void of
parsimony
, with one
hand
she
secures
her
husband
's
interest
, and with
the other
dispenses
to the
sons
and daughters of
poverty, the overplus of
those
blessings
which
her own prudence has helped to
secure
to
herself
.
She is always
strictly
neat in her apparel, but
entirely free from
shew
or finery; her whole
family is regular, uniform and decent, her
servants
respect
her, her
husband
idolizes her, and
her children look up to her as their friend and
benefactress
, from
whose
bright example they
may learn the road to
happiness
.
Should even misfortune overtake her,
she
is
still
chearful,
still
unembarrassed
, without a murmur
she
condescends
to perform even the
meanest
offices
for
herself
, her
husband
, and children;
she
exerts her
utmost
abilities to retrieve the
prosperity
they had unfortunately
lost
,
she
shares
her
husband's
care, and alleviates his concern -- and
should
their
honest
efforts to regain their former
state
of affluence fail,
she
sets
down perfectly
happy
in the reflection that
she
had
discharged
, to
the
utmost
of her power, the duties of that
station
,
in which it
pleased
Heaven to place her.
Yet, think not I mean entirely to
set
aside
those
accomplishments
, which when kept under
proper regulations, certainly tend to make the
female character more
irresistibly
charming.
There are a certain
class
of women to whom
these
accomplishments
are
absolutely
necessary
,
to their filling their
respective
characters with
propriety
.
A woman of independent fortune may with
safety
indulge her
taste
for
music
, drawing, &c.
but, in the name of common
sense
, what has a
girl to do with the fine arts, who, perhaps, after
she
leaves
school
, has neither time or opportunity
to
pursue
those
studies
,
unless
by
so
doing,
she
neglects
some
more
useful
employment.
I acknowledge that it is not
impossible
for the
useful
and ornamental branches of education to be
combined; nay, that it is even natural for a
woman
of
sense
and
discretion
to endeavour to blend
them in
such
a manner, as to render them only as
foils to each other, and the woman who
studies
to unite in
herself
, the attentive
housewife
, the
good mother, affectionate wife, well-informed
companion, and
accomplished
woman, is
certainly
a character
deserving
esteem
and veneration,
we look upon her
almost
as a being of a
superior
order, and
she
is at once beloved, admired and
respected
by both
sexes
.
As
so
much of the
happiness
of mankind
depends
on the females connected in their families,
I have expatiated on the
necessity
of young
women
being brought up in the practice of every
domestic
virtue, more largely than I at
first
intended
,
since
not only the
rising
generation, but
ages yet unborn
shall
venerate or execrate our
memories, according to the advice and example
we give our children.
If the daughters of the
present
age are
suffered
to remain totally ignorant of the
domestic
regulations
necessary
to be
observed
in every family,
what are we to expect in the next generation,
but that the ruin which has already begun to
shew
itself
in our
most
capital cities, will
spread
itself
all over the kingdom, and
sink
it at
last
in one
universal
state
of bankruptcy.
More, much more than we
should
at
first
be
led to imagine, depends on the education of the
female world. What ruin, what inevitable
desolation
may not an idle
dissipated
woman bring
on
those
who may unfortunately be attached to
her
person
.
And on the contrary, how does a
sensible
,
virtuous, well-informed female, exalt and ennoble
the thoughts of all who
converse
with her.
Were every parent of my opinion they would
first
, by example, plant the
seeds
of genuine
worth in the
breast
of their daughters, and by the
tenderest
care and
mildest
precept, cultivate each
budding virtue, 'till they
blossomed
in full
perfection
,
then ornamenting them with the elegant
accomplishments
necessary
to complete the female
character, render them at once the pride and glory
of their country.
URGANDA AND FATIMA,
AN EASTERN TALE.
In
one of the
most
beautiful vallies that lies
upon
the borders of the
East
lived Zegdad, an
inoffensive
shepherd
. He had but one child, and
having
been early deprived of his wife, he
lavished
his whole
stock
of
tenderness
on Fatima.
Though fortune had not been
lavish
of her gifts
to the father ofFatima, yet he wanted not the
necessaries
or comforts of life--his cottage was clean,
and
furnished
with every thing
useful
; his fields
supplied
them with food; his flock with raiment.
Fatima was
coarse
in her
person
, but
she
was
chearfull and good-natured--
she
rose
each morn
with the
seathered
songsters
, and chearfully
performed
the duties of her
station
; her whole
study
was to
please
her father, and a
smile
from
Zegdad
was at any time, ample recompence for the
severest
satigue
, and like a cordial
served
to revive
her drooping
spirits
. She would
assist
,
unasked
,
in the
most
laborious employments, and when
the labour of the day was
past
,
she
would lightly
trip over the green turf, with her young
companions
,
while her father played on the flagelet. The
mind of Fatima was calm as the delights of
Paradise
.
One day her father
sent
her to the grand
Vizier's
,
with fruit for his favorite--
she
was conducted
by an eunuch into the garden, where the beautiful
Semira was
reposing
on a bed of
roses
, clad in
all the pomp of
eastern
magnificence, while two
slaves
were fanning her to
rest
.
Fatima had never before
seen
aught but
simplicity--she
was filled with wonder and
astonishment
at the
surprising
beauty and grandeur of Semira,
and as
she
gazed, envy and
discontent
crept into
her hitherto
guileless
heart.
She returned home with a mind totally altered
to what it was. Her rural
pastimes
no more
deligted
her--labour was now a trouble --
she
had
been
awitness
to the
case
and indolence of Semira.
If at any time
she
caught a
glimpse
of her
person
in
the
stream
,
she
turned from it with
disgust
. Her
days were
joyless
, and her nights
spent
in
bewailing
her unhappy lot.
One evening, deaf to the
solicitations
of her
young companions,
she
retired to a thick grove,
and inattentive to the
sound
of the flagelet, thus
gave vent to her
sorrow
.
Oh! wretched Fatima, unhappy maid! Why
was I born to know
so
hard a fate--to eat the bread
of labour, to
sleep
upon a
rushy
couch, while
Semira is
surrounded
with
splendor
, is
served
by
kneeling
slaves
, and
sleeps
on a bed of down!
Why has nature denied me
those
ravishing
beauties
,
it has
so
bountifully
lavished
on her, her
eyes are bright as the
stars
, her lips like half
blown
roses
, her hand and arm like
polished
ivory.
Oh! why was I not lovely as Semira, and
favorite
to the grand Vizier--in this low abject
state
my
being is intolerable, I will no longer endure it
but in yon limpid
stream
lose
the remembrance of
myself
and Semira.
At this moment the Fairy Urganda
stood
before
her.
Thy complaints are
just
, Oh! Fatima (
said
she
) and if thou wilt
relinquish
thy home, and
forsake
thy father, thou
shalt
enjoy the
utmost
extent of thy
wishes
.
Fatima eagerly complied with the offered terms
and the Fairy immediately
sprinkled
her with
water
at the
same
time pronouncing
some
mystic
words,
Vol. II. I
when
she
was transformed into a virgin of
transcendent
beauty, and found
herself
in the garden
of a palace belonging to the grand Vizier.
The lovely Semira had the day before offended
her Lord, and was no longer a favorite. Fatima
attracted the notice of the Vizier--he ordered her
to be led into
splendid
apartments, clothed with
costly
robes, adorned with jewels, and appointed
slaves
to wait on her, and comply with all her
wishes
--and Fatima
supplied
the place of the
degraded
Semira.
She now thought
herself
the
happiest
among
the happy; but the Vizier was
passionate
,
capricious
,
jealous, and extremely cruel, and it was
not long before the
disappointed
Fatima
discovered
that to be favorite to the grand Vizier, was to live
only in
splendid
slavery
.
But though (
said
she
often to
herself
) though
the grand Vizier's favorite is
miserable
, how
superlatively
happy
must
be the favorite Sultana
of my Lord the Emperor! Oh! could I but attain
that envied
station
, how
soon
should
the imperious
Vizier
suffer
for his barbarity to me.
Again did the
bosom
of Fatima
suffer
all the
miseries
of
discontent
--the vaulted roofs,
spacious
gardens, and rich
presents
of the Vizier, no
longer charmed her. She fighed for the
ensigns
of royalty, and her pillow was nightly bedewed
with her tears.
One evening
she
retired to an arbour, at the
extremity
of the garden, and throwing
herself
on
the banks where
she
had
first
seen
Semira, thus
poured
sorth
her complaints.
How wretched is the fate of Fatima
condemned to drag a hated being with a man who
studies
only his own gratification, and expects
me to be the
slave
of his caprice and
passion
. Oh!
could I but get from this
detested
place, I would
fly to my Lord the Emperor, and bow my
self
low
in the
dust
before him. My charms might captivate
his royal heart, and I might reign the
Empress
of
the
East
.
As
she
spoke
these
words, a
sudden
light
entered
the arbour, and the Fairy Urganda again
stood
before her.
Beautiful Fatima,
said
she
, forbear your
complaints
,
the prophet permits you to enjoy your
wish
, then
rise
and follow me.
The Fairy led her to the Emperor's palace, and
placed her among a number of beautiful
slaves
,
I 2
from among which the Emperor was next
morning
to
chuse
a favorite.
In the morning the Emperor
passed
through the
apartment, and his choice fell on Fatima. She
was cloathed in the enfigns of royalty, led in
state
to the
mosque
, and in a few hours heard
herself
proclaimed
Empress
of the
East
.
But Fatima had, to the idea of royalty,
annexed
the ideas of youth and beauty, how
surprised
was
she
then to find the Emperor, old, ugly, and
deformed in his
person
,
morose
in his
disposition
,
and jealous in the extreme
she
shrunk
from
his embraces with horror, and contracted
so
settled
an
aversion
to him, that not all the
splendor
that awaited her could in the
smallest
degree
compensate
for the many tedious hours
she
was obliged
to devote to him.
Among the
slaves
that attended on Fatima, was
the artful Zynina, who had long, with envious
eyes, beheld the love of the Emperor
bestowed
on
others, and only watched an opportunity to
ingratiate
herself
in his favor, by rendering him
some
piece of
service
. To this end
she
cultivated the
friendship
of the new Queen, and by degrees
drew from her the
reason
of her tears and
dejection
.
This intelligence was
instantly
conveyed to the
Emperor, with the addition of Fatima's heart
being
dedicated to another.
Osmin
willing to be
convinced of the truth of Zynina's declaration,
desired
to be concealed in an apartment adjoining
the Queen's, where he might
easily
overhear any
thing that
passed
between her and the deceitful
slave
, who immediately returned to her
mistress
,
and artfully renewed the
conversation
.
Fatima, glad to unburthen her
almost
bursting
heart,
confessed
her
settled
aversion
to her Lord,
and that death
itself
would be preferable to her
present
situation
. Then death be thy portion,
cried the enraged Emperor,
suriously
rushing
into
the apartment, and lifting his glittering
scimitar
.
Fatima fell upon her knees, and, in an agony
of terror exclaimed, O that I was an humble
cottager
,
and had never known the pangs that wait
on
greatness
.
At that moment
she
found
herself
clad in her
sormer
homely apparel,
standing
at the door of
her father's cottage, when the Fairy appeared
and thus
addressed
her.
Fatima, I have
shewn
you the vanity of
human
wishes
, learn from hence to be content with the
allotments of Providence, Whatever be your
stiuation
I 3
in life,
submit
to it without repining, and
know that our holy Prophet, who ordereth all
things in this
terrestrial
world knoweth what is
best
for mortals: Fulfil therefore the
respective
duties of thy
station
, to the
utmost
of thy power:
envy not the
superior
lot of another, but humbly
take the
blessings
within thy reach, enjoy them
and be happy.
THE
INCENDIARY.
Among
the many evils that
escaped
from
Pandora's
box, to
infest
and plague mankind, I
know of none that has done more
mischief
than
envy.
Good heavens! how depraved
must
be the heart
that is pained by the
prosperity
, merit, or beauty
of another, or rejoices in their
debasement
.
Methinks, when I look round the world, I am
ready to hail each member of
society
as my brother
or
sister
, I rejoice in their
success
, acknowledge
their merit, admire their beauty, lament their
misfortunes, and
shed
the tear of
sincere
compassion
over their vices. I would not
possess
a heart
absorbed
in
selfish
views for the
universe
.
The man who lives only for
himself
, is, in my
opinion, a
monster
of ingratitude; his life is one
continued blank, except marked by
some
act of
inhumanity. If we
must
reckon that day
lost
in
which we perform no good action, what
must
we
think of a life
passed
in a continued
series
of
stupid
inattention to the
distresses
or injuries of our fellow
creatures.
Hail! heaven-born charity! bright
resplendent
virtue;
whose
dazzling rays hide from the
accusing
angel multitudes of offences,
blessed
is
the heart thou
dost
inhabit, happy is the man
whose
actions are guided by thee.
By charity I do not mean the merely
sharing
with
those
that need the
superabundant
gifts of
fortune, though ' tis certainly our duty to
alleviate
the misfortunes of others, yet by
so
doing we
do not fully
discharge
the duties of
christianity
.
Charity is that benevolence of heart, that
meekness
of
spirit
, which leads us to judge favorably
of the actions of others, never to propagate a
story
to the injury of a neighbour's character, but to
stand
forward the champion of innocence, and to
defend
those
, whom envy, malice, or revenge,
have
aspersed
.
Conscious
of its own rectitude,
suspects
not the integrity of another; ever ready
to pour the balm of
consolation
into the heart
wounded by
sorrow
; envies no
person
's
superior
lot, but takes the portion
assigned
by providence,
with gratitude,
uses
it with prudence, and gives
the overplus to the
sons
and daughters of poverty,
looks round the world with a
smile
of
complacency
,
and
wishes
every
bosom
as tranquil as its own.
Yet there are people in the world
whose
chief
pleasure
consists
in villifying and
aspersing
the
characters even of their
best
friends, and
sorry
I
am to
say
,
those
characters are too frequently
found among the fair
sex
. Would they but
consider
,
that while
depressing
the merits of another,
they do not
increase
their own, but rather attract
notice, and lead their acquaintance narrowly to
scrutinize
the conduct of a woman, who is
so
severe
upon their errors, it would certainly, in
some
measure
,
stop
the unbounded licence they give
their tongues.
I do not know a more hateful character than
Hecatissa
,
she
has indulged this evil
propensity
'till it
has become a part of her nature, and
she
could no
more entertain you for a few hours without a tale
of
scandal
than
she
could walk over the
glassy
surface
of the ocean. Many is the feeling heart
she
has wounded, many a breach of
friendship
has taken its
rise
from her malevolent tongue
she
cares not how dear the ties
she
endeavours to
break,
she
will
sow
dissention
between father and
child, brother and
sister
,
husband
and wife, and
exult in the
misery
she
occasions
; under the
fairest
semblance
of
friendship
,
she
will
steal
upon
the
unsuspecting
heart, and after being treated
with unbounded confidence, like the ungrateful
serpent
,
sting
the
breast
that harbours her!
She was, when very young, by the treachery
of a near relation, thrown into a
distressing
situation
,
from which the bounty and
generosity
of a
widow lady relieved her; not
satisfied
with merely
administering
to her
present
wants,
she
took her
into her family, and made her companion to her
daughter.
The innocent Anna conceived a
sincere
friendship
for her, and for many years they lived like
sisters
; innumerable were the favours heaped on
Hecatissa
, who remained with the family; till a
worthy man, attracted by her
person
and
specious
manner, made honorable
proposals
and married
her.
Hecatissa
might now have been the
happiest
woman breathing--her
husband
was generous,
humane, friendly, and good-natured to
excess
.
He
presented
her to his family, who received her
cordially, and the poor
easy
good man thought he
had
insured
his own
selicity
, but
Hecatissa
soon
shone
forth in her own proper character.
She planted
dissention
in her
husband
's family,
assumed
an unbecoming authority over all his
actions, and by her artful
ascendancy
contracted
his heart, and made him treat with
disrespect
the
very family who had
sheltered
her unprotected
youth! Her vile
insinuations
were aimed at the
character of Anna, nor was
she
the only object
of her malice; every woman who
possessed
superior
endowments of
person
or mind, was to
her a fit
subject
for
slander
. She
wished
no
person
to be more fortunate or happy than
herself
,
she
listened
to every malicious tale with avidity, repeated
them with
pleasure
, and aggravated every
circumstance
which had the
least
appearance of vice or
folly
.
She would
stoop
to
such
meanness
, that rather
than not
compass
a favorite point,
she
would
tamper
with
servants
, to obtain the
secrets
of a family.
She was once on a
visit
at the
house
of Serena,
she
found her beloved by her
servants
,
respected
by her friends, and tenderly
esteemed
by her
husband
.
Vexed to
see
how
superior
she
was in every
respect
to
herself
,
she
eagerly watched for
some
opportunity to
lessen
her merit. She
wrested
the
most
innocent and even laudable actions into guilt,
she
poisoned
the minds of her
servants
, and
traduced
her reputation
assuming
the appearance of
humility
and virtue,
she
endeavoured to throw on
Serena the odium of every vice which deformed
her own character.
But Serena was not long inveloped in the cloud
Hecatissa
had
spread
over her;
she
continued in
the regular
discharge
of the duties of her
station
,
paid no regard to the malicious
slanders
she
daily
heard, but, pitying the woman who could
so
far
forget truth and
justice
as to blacken the character
of one
she
prosessed
a
friendship
for, treated her
with the
silent
contempt her conduct merited.
No
sensible
person
will
scruple
to affirm that
Hecatissa
is
miserable
. Hated and
despised
by all her
acquaintance, her
society
is
shunned
like the
pestilence
;
and though by her
consummate
art
she
still
imposes
upon her
husband
, and retains his
affection
,
her
discontent
and ill-nature prevent her
reaping
any
pleasure
in his company;
she
is jealous,
peevish
and
uneasy
; in
short
she
has
such
a legion of
torments in her own
bosom
, that
she
often applies
to a comforting cordial to
raise
her
depressed
spirits
.
However
despicable
the character of
Hecatissa
may appear that of Prudelia is equally
so
. Prudelia
is a woman who pays the
nicest
regard to propriety
and decorum,
she
is ever prying into her
neighbour's
conduct, and if their actions do not exactly
agree with her
scrupulous
notions of rectitude,
she
hesitates
not to conclude them abandoned and
lost
to every
sense
of virtue.
Albert and Julia had been married near four
years, during which time they had lived in mutual
love and confidence, when their ill-fortune took
them to live in the
same
street
with Prudelia.
Albert
followed the
sea
, of
consequence
Julia was
often
left for months together the guardian of her
honor
,
the
mistress
of her own actions. She was lively
in her
disposition
, but her heart was the
seat
of pure
innocence.
Albert was gone his
accustomed
voyage, when
Prudelia undertook to
scrutinize
the conduct of
Julia.
Prudelia had
visited
her,
she
had been a
witness
to
the innocent gaiety of her temper,
she
had even
pretended to admire her vivacity and good-humor,
but
she
whispered
among her friends, that
she
thought it was highly improper for a young
woman
like her,
whose
husband
was from home, to
receive
so
much company, or be
so
frequent in her
visits
abroad. She watched every movement of
Julia
,
was informed of all her
visitors
names, knew what
time they came and went and even what hours
she
retired to
rest
and
arose
.
Julia was a woman of nice feelings,
she
was
tenacious
of honor; and the bare idea of that honor
being
suspected
was extremely painful to her. She was
uneasy
at the watchful eye Prudelia kept upon her
actions, not that
she
feared to have them
srcutinized
,
but
because
she
did not think
herself
obliged to be
accountable for her conduct to any
person
but her
husband
. She therefore grew
distant
and
reserved
,
and whenever Prudelia called on her, gave little
or no
answer
to her many artful
questions
concerning
where
she
had been, or how
she
had
spent
her
time.
About this time a brother of Julia's failed in
business
,
he retired to a
house
in the environs of
West-minster
,
to avoid the importunity of his creditors.
Julia was tenderly attached to her brother,
she
exerted every power to
serve
his
distressed
family,
and even parted with her plate, and
some
other
valuables, to
raise
money to
supply
the
present
exigence.
The attorney who had the care of
settling
her
brother's affairs, was frequently with her for an
hour or two together, and often
she
went away with
him in a coach, and was
absent
for
several
days, as
the
business
which employed
so
large a
share
of her
time, required
secresy
,
she
never mentioned it to
Prudelia, nor did
she
when going out ever tell the
servant
where
she
was to be found.
One morning the attorney had
breakfasted
with
her and
she
was gone with him to her brother,
Vol. II. K
when Albert unexpectedly returned. The
servant
could give no account where her
mistress
was, and
Prudelia who had
seen
him return, came over to
invite him to dine with her family.
I am
sorry
my Julia is from home,
said
he, but
there was no
possibility
of her thinking to
see
me to
day, as I am returned at
least
six
weeks before the
time appointed.
Why yes, replied Prudelia, with a
significant
look, I fancy you will be a very unexpected
guest
.
It will be an agreeable
surprize
though,
said
Albert.
Perhaps
so
,
said
, Prudelia
smiling
,
contemptnously
.
The
smile
, the
significant
look, alarmed Albert,
have you any
reason
to think otherways, madam,
said
he? Surely Julia will be
pleased
with my
return.
Oh!
most
certainly
she
will, replied
she
,
smiling
again; but, no doubt,
she
would have liked a little
more warning of your arrival.
By heavens, madam,
said
Albert, your words
distress
me beyond
measure
, you cannot mean to
glance an
aspersion
at the character of Julia, and
yet what other motive can you have for
those
contemptuous
smiles
. Tell me, dear madam, the
meaning
of
these
ambiguous looks; but hold, if it is
any thing to Julia's
disadvantage
I
shall
not
believe
it though uttered by an angel.
Indeed, Sir, (
said
Prudelia,
assuming
a
serious
countenance, in which was blended a mixture of
pity and anger) far be it from me to injure the
reputation of any woman, or ever interfere between
man and wife, you are united for life, and 'tis
therefore your duty to bear with each others
foibles
,
as well as you can.
My Julia has no foibles, replied Albert, or if
she
has I never
discovered
them.
I do not pretend to
say
she
has, my good friend,
but I
wish
she
would come home.
Albert joined the
wish
, and the day
passed
on
without much farther
conversation
.
As the evening advanced he grew
uneasy
, and
when the clock
struck
ten, he exclaimed
impatiently
,
where can
she
be?
Patience, my good Sir,
said
the artful
Prudelia
,
you may not perhaps
see
her
these
two or
three hours.
Julia was not
used
to keep
such
late hours,
said
he
pensively
.
K 2
Oh! that is nothing, new connections form
new manners;
she
is never home much earlier, nay,
'tis very likely
she
may not be at home to night.
You
seem
to be aiming at
something
, madam,
said
Albert, for heaven's
sake
speak
out, and
deliver
me from this torture of
suspence
.
This was the favourable moment for the vile
incendiary--she
prefaced her
scandalous
tale, with
the
sorrow
she
felt at being obliged to give his
worthy heart
so
much pain,
said
, had Julia
returned
in any tolerable time,
she
would have kept
the affair to
herself
, but as
she
found he already
began to
suspect
something
was
amiss
,
she
thought
it was
best
he
should
be informed of the whole, that
he might take his
measures
accordingly.
She then informed him, that during his
abscence
Julia's extravagance had known no bounds
that
she
had paid no regard to her
reputation---received
the
constant
visits
of one particular
gentleman
,
and made frequent
excursions
into the
country
with him, where
she
staid
for
several
days, that
to
supply
her extravagance and that of her
paramour
,
she
had parted with her watch, plate, and
other
valuables; and concluded with
saying
, her
heart bled to think
so
worthy a man
should
be
united
to a woman who knew
so
little how to value
her good fortune.
Albert
listened
with every mark of horror and
astonishment
, at length(
starting
from his
seat
and
stamping
his foot with vehemence)he cried, `tis
every
syllable
as
false
as hell, my Julia can never
have betrayed the honor I
trusted
to her care, or
abused
the confidence I
reposed
in her.
'Tis well, Sir, replied Prudelia, with a look
of offended pride, you doubt my veracity,
however
you will find the whole neighbourhood are
acquainted with her errors, as well as I am, nay
call your own
servant
,
she
can
assert
the truth of
what I
say
.
The
servant
was called,
she
confirmed the
infamous
tale, and Albert vowed to be revenged on
his innocent wife.
Prudelia had judged rightly, Julia did not
return
that night, and though Albert went home,
and retired to his apartment, he never attempted
to lye down, but
traversed
the room in the
utmost
agitation of
spirits
during the whole night.
In the mean time Julia was enjoying, with her
brother's family, the
most
exquisite
satisfaction
.
His failure was
occasioned
by remittances not
arriving
in proper time for him to make good
some
obligations he had entered into, the money Julia
had
raised
for him, had prevented immediate
bankruptcy, and that day
several
ships
had
arrived
with remittances, which would again enable
him to appear among his friends with credit.
The whole family were together at his lodgings,
and a
smile
of tranquillity
sat
on every
countenance
.How
very happy I
should
be,
said
Julia,
looking round her, if my Albert was joined in
this loved company, I
should
then, at one view,
behold all that is
most
dear to me on earth.
When
supper
was over, the evening was far
advanced, Julia
proposed
staying
with them all
night, and walking home in the cool of the
morning
.
She retired to
rest
with a heart lightened of its
cares, offered up a prayer for her Albert's
safety
,
and
sunk
into an
undisturbed
slumber
, little
thinking the
miseries
that awaited her in the
morning
.
At
six
o'clock
she
arose
, and
kissing
her little
sleeping
niece, who had been her bed-fellow,
stole
softly
down
stairs
, and walked
leisurely
towards
home, enjoying the
freshness
of the
morning
,
as
she
walked thro' the park, and
contemplating
on the happy change in her brother's
affairs
.
It was near eight o'clock when
she
arrived at
her own door. My
master
is come home,
madam
,
said
the maid, as
she
opened it.
Home, cried Julia, in an accent of joyful
surprize
,
and running eagerly up
stairs
, opened the
door of his apartment, and would have thrown
herself
into his arms, but he
pushed
her from him
with violence, and cried by heavens, this affected
joy
shall
not cover your guilt; then looking at
her
sternly
, he added, how have you
passed
this
night, degenerate ungrateful Julia?
Julia had never been
addressed
by Albert before
but in a voice of the
most
soothing
tenderness
.
She
staggered
to the
nearest
chair, and faintly
exclaiming, what a horrid change is this, and
burst
into a violent flood of tears.
Albert had never
seen
his Julia weep before,
but his heart wept with her, but he now took her
surprize
for a token of guilt, and imputed her
tears to the effects of art. He therefore regarded
them not, but walked about the room in
sullen
silence
.
Oh! heavens,
said
Julia, what have I done to
deserve
this; tell me, Albert, how have I
forfeited
your affection?
By betraying my honor,
said
he fiercely, by
becoming an abandoned wanton.
Heaven is my
witness
, I have done neither,
said
she
,
sinking
on her knees, Oh! Albert, kill
me
instantly
, but do not
suspect
my fidelity. I
will
bless
you with my
last
breath, and dying,
declare
,
I never entertained even a thought to the
prejudice of your honor, or the purity of the
affection
I bear to you.
Cursed
dissembler
,
said
the enraged Albert,
and he
spurned
her from him with his foot. She
shrieked
and fell, her head
struck
the bed-
post
,
and the blood
gushed
in a torrent from her
forehead
.
Merciful heaven, cried he, I have murdered
her. He caught her from the ground, but found
neither
sense
nor breath remained. Frantic, he
rang the bell for a
servant
, and
sent
for
immediate
assistance
.
A
surgeon
examined her head, the
skull
was
fractured. After the wound was
dressed
she
opened
her eyes, and fixed them upon her
husband
.
Albert,
said
she
, I know not who has
poisoned
your mind, or how you could
suspect
the
fidelity
of Julia. Believe me, I am innocent, in my
cabinet you will find papers, that will unravel
any
seeming
mystery
in my late conduct. I die,
but dying
bless
you, for all your
kindness
to me.
Ah! my love, 'tis not the wound I received on
my head, but that which you inflicted on my heart,
that terminates my
existence
! I loved you too
well, Albert, to feel the privation of your
affetion
and live; my heart unprepared to meet your
unkindness
sunk
under it,
struggled
and broke.
She attempted to throw her arms round his
neck, but nature was
exhausted
;
she
could only
say
, Oh!
bless
him heaven  and her
spirit
took
its flight to the regions of eternal day.
Albert's
distress
was too great for
description
,
when he found he had by his blind
passion
,
terminated
the
existence
of an innocent, valuable
woman
,
whom he loved with the
most
servent
affection
.
A deep melancholy
seized
him, nor could
all the attentions of his friends
rouse
him from the
torpid
stupor
he had
sunk
into, he grew
worse
and
worse
, and ended his days in a mad-
house
.
As there are too many Prudelia's in the world,
we cannot be too cautious how we believe a
malevolent
assertion
, or give way to
suspicion
and
jealousy
.
