My Dear Young Friend
:
Do you recollect when you were last with
us, you asked me, on occasion of my
describing
some of the scenes of my youthful days,
to give you a chapter from my early life? If
you have forgotten your request and my
promise
to comply with it, the accompanying
manuscript will remind you of both, and at
the same time of the proverbGive him an
inch and he will take an ell. A short time
after you left us, I one day got Alfred to
make me some good pens, and taking a sheet
of his large school paper, that I might have
room and verge enough, I sat down to fulfil
my promise. I soon found myself at the end
of the sheet with my chapter unfinished, and
1*
what I had written appearing to me very
meager
.
The effort, however, created an interest
in the occupation. Half-buried recollections
with their trains of association rose up. The
motives of pleasure and curiosity added
themselves
to the simple purpose of keeping my
word to you. The design of enveloping fact
in fiction grew out of them. I resolved to
give you half a dozen chapters instead of
one; and here you have the result of this
resolve
in the form of a volumeand an
exemplification
of the growth of great things out of
small. When I tell you, that the task of writing
it has afforded me much pleasure, I know I
furnish you with a motive to bear patiently the
task of reading it. My wife, too, has been
highly amused with the productions of my
book, as she calls it. She has indeed
contributed
to it. The proper names are all
testimonials
of her genius for fiction. She claims
to have supplied, besides, useful hints, and
even to have made several important
corrections
:
most of these claims, however, are
questionable
.
You will be wrong if you ascribe
to her any portion of my character. I alone
am answerable for the liberties which in that
picture fiction has taken with fact. Whatever
difficulty you may have in discerning the
proportions
in which they are mingled, you will
have none when I tell you that you have a
sincere friend in
Herbert Barclay.P. S. How soon shall we see you again in
this part of Maryland? Alfred asks often
when you are coming back. His partiality
for you is owing chiefly, I believe, to his
triumphs
over you in geography.CHAPTER I.
Had
I observed that Herbert's natural
dispositions exposed him to be particularly
injured
by pursuing this course, I should not
have permitted him to pursue it. Respect
for his father's injunctions would have yielded
to regard for his welfare. Indeed, in
disregarding
such injunctions from such a motive,
I should have felt, that I was doing a duty
towards my brother himself, as well as
towards
my nephew. But Herbert, has, I think,
lost less by the imperfections of education,
than most young persons lose. He has run
smoothly over the customary course, learning
the little that can be learnt in it, with such
readiness, that acquisition has not been to him
an irksome labor, nor absence from his
teachers
,
liberation from prison. He has none
of the disgust for study, which is so often
the strongest impression brought away from
school. Besides, with the will and
opportunity
,
a young man of twenty can, in a great
measure, make up for early deficiencies.
Herbert has, too, his mother's
enthusiasm
.
Yes: and enthusiasm is the wings of life,
that take from the weight of its heaviest
burdens
.
The light-headed are often borne
away by it to dizzy heights; but in Herbert,
there is solidity enough to balance its
buoyancy
.
Had your brother reversed the
provisions
of his will, and given you over his son
the control he gave you over his property, he
would have charged you with a more suitable
duty and provided more wisely for his son.
With his high estimation of you, it was
singular
that he should have undertaken to
prescribe
himself for twelve years after his death
for Herbert's education.
Far stronger, Elizabeth, than individual
opinion, is the force of custom. In my
brother's
conduct spoke the voice of the
multitude
.
He was a strict conformist to established
usage. This was to him lawso sacred, that
he suffered no personal partiality to infringe
it. He did not think for himself in such
matters; and he was therefore incapable of
appreciating the consequences of doing so in
others. Divergence from the general opinion
was in his view an unprofitable eccentricity:
he could not realize that it might be a step
forward. Esteem for me, so far from gaining
consideration for my theoretical opinions, he
turned to account against them; and in his
last moments it was a source of comfort to
him, that in my promise to carry into effect
the plan he laid down, he could rely against
the temptations of my own principles.
The further guidance of Herbert,so far
as he may need or be willing to be guided,
devolves now by your brother's own wish
upon you
And therein again is apparent the same
influence that controlled him in making
provision
for Herbert's instruction. Tuition at
an expensive public school, and after that
four years in the classes of a collegeand
the education of a young man is completed!
My brother was satisfied that he had done all
he could doall that could be done, in
securing
this to his son. And had he lived to see
how successfully Herbert has passed through
the gradation, he would have believed that
there is not in the world a better educated
young man! And had I told him that on the
play ground, from his college amusements and
relaxation, Herbert had learnt more that is
available in life than in the school room and
college hallsmore from his class-mates than
from his class-teachers, he would have
laughed
at me. And yet, so it is. A Roman
galley
is as well suited to navigate the
Atlantic
,a
monk's library of the middle ages, as
serviceable for scientific acquirement,an
ancient
war-chariot, as fitted to oppose flying
artillery, as is the scholastic system of
education
to prepare youth for the performances of
manhood. This system is at once arduous
and barren: it is like a hickory nut,hard to
crack, and nearly all shell. Its machinery is
as unwieldy as it is weak, encumbering
without
moving the young powers. Its effects
are as superficial as its operation is laborious.
It does not reach the swelling roots of the
nascent faculties; it merely encrusts them with
a shallow layer of verbal learning, which, far
from fertilizing them, obstructs their
healthful
development. Often have I observed,
when Herbert has been with us in his
vacations
,the
spontaneous movement of his
mind to which education ought to give
elasticity
and boldness, checked by the habitual
pressure of heavy forms.
The few weeks in each year he has spent
with us, were times of such full enjoyment to
him, that he returns with the happiest
anticipations
.
In coming to live with us, he feels
that he comes to his home. Did you observe
how his countenance sparkled with gladness
yesterday when he burst in upon us on his
arrival?
Yes: he has a warm and happy
disposition
.
It was towards the end of September 18,
that Mr. and Mrs. Barclay were thus engaged
in conversation.
The room in which they were sitting was
furnished with simplicity. A few busts and
pictures gave to it that air of refined luxury
which tasteful productions of the fine arts
always
diffuse around them. On one side, two
windows reached the floor, through which
the eye rested on a rich verdure of sward
and foliage.
About thirty acres expanded before the
house, gently sloping towards the south in
graceful undulation to a body of forest, whose
tall trees, running irregularly in front and at
the sides of the lawn, completely enclosed it,
and bounded the view. A few majestic
remnants
of the primitive forest, scattered over
2
the open ground, deepened the verdure with
their broad shadows. Near the walls on
either side, rose from the turf the huge
trunks of several oaks, the offspring of ages.
These did not,like their brothers beyond, as
if in rivalry of aspiring neighbors,shoot up
with clean stems high into the air; but, early
disengaged from the vicinity of other trees,
they had expanded broadly over the earth,
sending out, at a few feet above their roots,
gnarled branches which stretched afar their
brawny limbssturdy kings of the forest,
that looked in their freshness, as if they still
grew in vigor, mocking time and rejoicing in
the tempest.
The sun was declining, imparting as it
approached
the horizon, by the contrast of light
and shadow from its oblique rays, a livelier
picturesqueness to the lovely scene. This
effect was heightened by the irregular
projections
from the body of the wood, one side
of them glowing with golden light, while the
other had already put on and cast beside it
on the ground a deep shade, giving to the
retreating recesses that mysterious
indistinctness
,
which a great writer has cited, as a fit
image of what is called in literature, the
romantic
,
as distinguished from the
classical
.
To the right of the house, one of these
withdrawing openings, which seemed to
invite
the beholder to explore them, led through
the trees up a considerable elevation, on
reaching
which, a wide prospect met the eye. At
about two miles distant was spread out a
large city, covering, as all American cities do,
a great extent of surface, and, with its
straggling
suburbs, presenting no defined outline.
On its furthest side lay, half embraced by it,
a mass of water, whose still bosom reflected
softly the red beams of the sun. The
position
of the neighboring grounds gave to the
water from this point the appearance of a
lake, although the tall masts of ships bore
evidence of a deep outlet to the sea. The
prospect extended far around over a
cultivated
country, and terminated on the right
and south in wooded ridges, and on the left,
in low grounds which marked the course of
the river.
Returning from the spot whence this
extensive
and diversified scene was beheld, to
the wood-inclosed lawn, was like suddenly
passing from a crowded street into the
stillness
of one's dwelling.
The exterior of the house corresponded
with the simple beauty around it and the taste
within. It was of moderate size and without
pretension. The art of its design manifested
itself in the pleasing impression produced,
while the means by which it was produced
were so skilfully disposed and mingled as not
to give prominence to any individual
architectural
element; unlike many buildings which
ambitiously court notice by the display of
some one outward characteristic of art, and,
intended to be fine specimens of architecture,
are in reality offensive monuments of
ostentatation
.
The conversation of Mr. and Mrs. Barclay,
was interrupted by the approach of its
subject
who galloped up to the door.
Well, Herbert, you have returned early,
said his uncle, who went out to meet him.
Yes, sir, said Herbert, as they walked
into his house. Mr. Grey was not at his
office: I saw him only for a moment after I
had started to come out. He made me
promise
to spend the day with him to-morrow.
He has wished your return almost as
much as we have, Herbert, said Mr.
Barclay
.
Alfred Grey will be a friend whom
I am sure you will delight in. He has half a
dozen years the start of you in life, and will
be often able to give you a helping hand
better
than we old people, for he is fresh from
the ground you are about entering on.
He will not help you, however, to
partners
at a dance, said Mrs. Barclay. He is
not a frequenter of large companies.
I am provided in that way already, said
Herbert, I met Mr. Seldon, who offered me
a seat in his carriage for every ball I should
wish to go to
2*
He must have turned over a new leaf
lately; for he has always confined himself to
a small circle. But I suppose, in making you
this offer, he meant, all that were worth
going
to.
While I was talking to him, continued
Herbert, Dr. Walsall came up and
greeted
me very cordially, and begged me to make
a convenience of his table whenever I wanted
a dinner.
Ah! that's a valuable invitation, said
Mr. Barclay. The doctor, Herbert, keeps
the best cook in town.
In playful familiar conversation the three
passed a happy evening; Herbert, in the
joyousness
of youthful spirits, and Mr. and Mrs.
Barclay, in the warm pleasure of kindly
sympathy
,
and almost parental tenderness, which
his presence awakened.
CHAPTER II.
Herbert
was at that age when the present
is all in all. Experience has not taught its
lessons of forethought: the mind has not yet
worn itself a channel for a continuous course,
but overflows in sudden unconnected
impulses
:
young memory carries no burden
imagination sees no obstacle: the past is a
dreamthe future a vision. To Herbert the
world appeared a plain, over which he could
course at will;the area where the
movements
of his mind were to pass into easy
actions
.
As he rode into town the next day, no
object
sparkling in the sunshine felt its warmth
more genially than he did. Although
looking
forward to happy hours, he was not
impatient
to arrive; but he rode slowly along
in the enjoyment of undefined feelings: the
sense of existence was a full pleasure. His
situation left him nothing to desire. His
uncle and aunt had no children: he was to
them the object of parental instinct: in their
house he enjoyed the affection and the
freedom
of a home. The future lay before him
as inviting as the town towards which he
rode.
On his entrance into the city, his musings
and vague sensations gave place to a more
lively pleasure. The noises and sights of a
busy town, have an animating effect even
upon those who are daily accustomed to them.
The activity of perception required by the
variety of objects is enlivening: the mere
passer-by
catches from the crowd some of that
cheerfulness which occupation always
communicates
:
there is, too, on every side, much
that is directly designed to attract the
beholder
.
This moving scene acted upon the
happy mood of Herbert, like the wind upon
a well-tuned harp, awakening its strings to
artless harmony. As he walked through the
spacious streets, the large houses, with their
marble steps and bright windows, looked to
him to enclose happiness and elegance and
intelligence. When, in passing an open door,
his eye wandered for a moment up a long
hall, he felt curious to enterthe inmates, he
thought, must be charming people. Did the
sound of a piano reach his earit bore on its
melody a form of loveliness.
Alfred Grey was rejoiced to see him. He
was several years older than Herbert, and
was on terms of intimacy with Mr. Barclay.
Herbert had known him as the most frequent
visitor at his uncle's, and had early felt for
him that confiding regard which the younger
members of a family are prone to entertain
towards the friends of the elder. The frank
and sprightly manner of Alfred was calculated
to encourage this feeling, and the interest he
always manifested in Herbert, had ripened it
into a personal attachment, so that Herbert
now that he was grown up, was strongly
attracted
towards him.
When the hour for dining drew near,
Alfred
interrupted their conversation, telling
Herbert that his sister expected them to dine
with her. You have seen my sister, Mrs.
Vernon, at your uncle's. I have told her you
were coming to pass the day with me, and
that I would give her a share of your visit.
Ellen is fond of company, so that we shall
probably have two or three others at dinner.
The better for you, as you are now to begin
the study of what is called the world. You
will find men harder that Latin or Greek.
Their radical motives are often much more
unlike their outward demonstrations than a
Greek root is unlike its derivatives. And
womenbut let us go, or we shall get into
another long talk.
They found at Mrs. Vernon's, Mr. Seldon,
and another gentleman whom Herbert had
seen before, Mr. Penniman; and a short time
after themselves, Dr. Walsall and his
daughter
came in.
Notwithstanding the contrary conclusion to
which the spectacle of a dinner at the public
table of one of our large American hotels
would lead, it may be stated as a fact in the
natural history of man, that eating is a
sociable
occupation. Whether it is to be
accounted
for by the action of the selfish principle,
that the feeling of prosperity in himself
diffuses
over a man a superficial benevolence
towards others,according to which a
diner
would grow in graciousness with each
mouthful; or that the sympathy of a common
object renders a circle, engaged
simultaneously
in the satisfying of the first of earthly
wants, peculiarly susceptible of mutual good
will; or that the moistening of the palate like
the oiling of a hinge, imparts a smoothness to
the motions of the tongue; or that these
several
causes combine,which is the most
likely
;
certain it is, that good humor, if it be in
the nature of the individuals at all, prevails
round a dinner table. Each one is disposed
to expand towards his neighbors
accommodatingly
in speech and feeling. Herein, human
beings,with the one exception of the
spectacle
above alluded to,differ from other
carnivorous animals, which in their hurried
craunching and intent looks, have an aspect
of concentrated selfishness.
The elements of social enjoyment were on
this occasion present in the fittest quantity and
in excellent proportions. The company was
small, so that at the table its unity was not
broken; each individual contributing
according
to his will and means to the general
entertainment
.
What each one had to say, went
to the common fund of conversation, and
was not diverted into separate channels, as it
is apt to be when a meeting of the kind is
numerous. The hostess was well suited to
call into play the social and conversational
resources
of her guests, so as to produce lively
harmony. Fond of society, she appeared in
it with the animation of unaffected pleasure,
so becoming in itself and so flattering to
others
.
Graceful and affable, she possessed that
nice tact which the desire and the ability to
please confer. Mr. Vernon showed also to
advantage. The most of his time was spent
in the routine of mercantile business; but he
had taste to view a scene like this as
something
more than mere relaxation from labor.
He was one of those men whose surface is very
susceptible of polish, and had his
opportunities
been better his merits would have been
more substantial; still, his natural endowments
were not of a calibre to induce the opinion
that much had been lost for want of
cultivation
.
Dr. Walsall was a talker; and like all
others of the class, disposed to that
conversational
monopolizing which is only bearable
when made by talent and wit. He was here
kept in check by the superior intelligence of
Alfred Grey, and somewhat, perhaps, by the
fear of a more direct rebuke, which Alfred,
at all times impatient of encroachment of any
kind, would not have been slow to give.
Herbert was the least active participant in the
scene: the most animated contributor to its
3
gaiety did not, however, derive from it more
pleasure than he did. He felt at his ease: the
absence of this feeling is the only drawback
to the enjoyment of a young person
beginning
to associate with men and women. Few
young men were more than Herbert under
the influence of youthful diffidence, which,
like the chill of the first plunge into a bath,
betokens a healthful warmth below the
surface
.
But there was in him no want of the
self-confidence, which is the result of proper
self-respect; and his mind was by nature too
well balanced and his character too frank for
the exhibition, under any circumstances, of an
awkward bashfulness. His feelings at once
shared the familiar sociability of the circle.
As the one who was most the stranger, and as
the friend of her brother, Mrs. Vernon was
led both by courtesy and duty to make him the
particular object of hospitable attention. This
she did, not by distinguishing him from the
rest of the company by a direct attentiveness,
but by a bearing as winning as it was natural,
which blended her habitual affability with an
unobtrusive personal interest in Herbert; so
that he felt as much at his ease beside her as
if he had been seated there for the hundredth
time. On the other side of him sat Miss
Walsall. He had never seen her before.
Her manner towards Herbert was as
unconstrained
as towards an old acquaintance, so
that he several times looked into her face
inquiringly
,
thinking that he must have been
mistaken in believing her a stranger to him:
there was a quiet self-possession in it. Hers
was a countenance that invited observation by
the placid calmness with which it bore it.
The eye returned to it the more frequently
and dwelt upon it the longer from its
superficial
insensibility to the gaze. It did not
court admiration: it was a passive recipient of
it. It did not reflect the looks that fell upon
it: it absorbed them. In such a countenance,
there is a peculiar attractiveness, owing,
perhaps
,
partly to the scope it gives to the
imagination
its
tranquil surface tempting each
beholder
to figure on it something of what he
fancies or wishes it to express; partly,
perhaps
,
to the character of submissiveness it
seems to bespeakalways to a man's eye an
engaging sign in woman.
The conversation was lively; at first, as is
wont, skimming over the surface of ordinary
topics, and becoming deeper as the company
became disengaged from the business of
eating
.
Although Dr. Walsall was withheld
from indulging his propensity at the expense
of the others; being, like all great talkers
similarly situated, uncomfortable under the
restriction, he every now and then made an
effort to break through it. Herbert was the
pivot of one of these attempts. The Doctor
had been thrown out for some time. Mr.
Seldon had just been giving a description of
an English nobleman's household, having been
led to do so by allusions in a recent novel,
which Alfred, called upon by the ladies, had
criticised somewhat at length. When Mr.
Seldon ceased speaking, the Doctor, who had
got very impatient under his long silence, and
who felt piqued that these two gentlemen
should have held possession of the company's
ear longer than they were disposed to let him
hold it, took advantage of the pause, and
abruptly
asked Herbert what profession he had
chosen. Herbert was taken by surprise by
the question, not only from the sudden
interruption
of the current given to his thoughts
by the previous conversation, but because the
subject was one he had not as yet steadily
considered
.
He answered, that he had made no
choice. Alfred remarked, that he thought
Mr. Barclay had done well in not hurrying
his decision on such a point. The Doctor,
delighted at having succeeded in introducing
a topic on which he felt confident he could
take the lead, was pleased to hear this from
Alfred.
Hurrying his decision! said he. Why,
Mr. Grey, when I was at Mr. Barclay's age,
I had taken my degree in medicine and
commenced
the practice.
3*
In your day, Doctor, said Alfred, there
was something to be gained by hurry. The
number of professional men was so small, that
young graduates found practice waiting for
them: now, they have to wait for practice.
The greater reason for commencing
early
,
said the Doctor. The longer they
have to wait, the sooner they should begin.
But a hasty choice may mar a man's
fortune
by a misdirection of his powers,
rejoined
Alfred. Moreover, the trials of
competition
are now so much greater, that when
the choice is made
What, interrupted the Doctor, can fit a
man for competition so well as practice? The
sooner he begins, therefore, the sooner and
the more effectually will he be formidable to
competitors. As to misdirection of powers;
there can be no misdirection, when a young
man has industry and ambition. The mind,
as Mr. Locke says, is like a sheet of white
paper, upon which any thing may be written,
and the way to make the most of its
universal
capacity is, to confine it to one subject.
Division of labor is as productive in the
intellectual
as in the mechanical world. A young
man who wishes for eminence should
concentrate
his mind upon his profession, and the
younger he is (his preparatory education
being
completed) the more easy will this
concentration
be. If he postpones determining
upon his career, he will become interested
in other pursuits, and when he sets about
professional studies, he will find, that his
mind, distracted by miscellaneous smatterings,
is unfitted for the exclusive devotion which is
essential to success, or will be trained to it
with difficulty. Here the Doctor, well
satisfied
with his progress, and not doubting
that all who heard him were equally so,
diverged
into a panegyric on his own
profession
.
This was a favorite topic with him;
partly from sincerity, of which egotism was
the father, and partly from the affectation
which is the growth of worldliness. He was
interrupted by Alfred: Doctor, there is a
question to be disposed of, before we reach
the one you are entering uponeven
admitting
that the comparative merits of different
professions and honest callings can be
properly
a subject for abstract discussion.
What is that? said the Doctor.
Whether, answered Alfred, the
engaging
in a profession or other established
lucrative
occupation be in all cases advisable. You
seem to take that for granted.
And do not you? exclaimed the Doctor.
I look upon that as an established American
idea. Mr. Seldon, who avows his English
prepossessions, is the only one of this
company
,
I presume, who does not adopt it.
I do not differ from you entirely, Dr.
Walsall, said Mr. Seldon. I regard the
law as a branch of a liberal education: the
study of it is essential to a gentleman.
For one, Doctor, I do not agree with
you, said Mr. Penniman. The prevalence
of the notion, which you call an American
idea, that every young man, whatever may be
his circumstances, should engage in some
business
,
is no favorable sign of the taste of a
community, and is an evidence that the
refinements
and elegancies of life are not
appreciated
.
The labors and habits of business
are incompatible with that pervading polish,
which only can make society agreeable. A
few individuals may always be picked out
here he bowed to the companywho are
exceptions to this effect; but their presence
renders the general deficiency in manners the
more conspicuous.
Mr. Penniman, said Dr. Walsall, this
exclusiveness is not only unrepublicanit is
impracticable. You would undermine the
basis of society in attempting to polish its
surface.
Not at all, said Mr. Penniman. In a
wealthy city, the number of persons who
have the means to live in elegance is large.
This class should be contented with their
wealth, and not labor to increase it.
Manners
are artificial: they are like green-house
plantsthey require constant care. How
can men who pass the most of every day in
the drudgery and routine of business, acquire
gracefulness either of body or mind? The
business of the affluent should be the
elegances
of life. Duty as well as taste
commends
this to them. The refining of the
manners
elevates the morals of a community.
Mr. Penniman's father had been a tanner,
and having made a large fortune, died,
leaving
his only son, just of age, his heir. The
young Mr. Penniman immediately sold the
tannery and bought a curricle. He soon after
made the tour of Europe, and returned
with a coat of arms and a French valet. He
was now about eight and twenty, and a by
no means insignificant member of good
society
.
The neglect, or more properly, the
perversion
of natural advantages, said Alfred,
is strikingly exemplified in the conduct of
those classes of this country who are the
most favored by circumstances. It would
seem as if, under the invisible influence of
supreme
justice,ever active to equalize the
lots of humanity,we restrict ourselves
socially
in proportion to our exemption from
political trammels. Unburdened from the
state by the weight of laws, we
counterbalance
our freedom as citizens by the voluntary
subjection of ourselves, as men, to a social
despotism of opinion, to which is applied the
name of
public
with as much reason as that
of
world
is to a coterie of gossips. Mr.
Penniman had a horror of satire, and began
to feel uncomfortable. Dr. Walsall was not
less dissatisfied: he perceived that he should
have to be silent for some time. Alfred had
not taken up the conversation for the purpose
of refuting the opinions of either of these
gentlemen: that, by itself, he thought an
unprofitable
task, and he never talked for
display
.
Truth was always his object when in
earnest, and he became so now on Herbert's
account. Observing that Herbert listened
attentively
,
he proceeded.The mighty
circumstances
which cast us a strong young
people
upon these fresh shores, disenthralled us
from the tyranny of European custom as well
as from that of government. Boldly and
wisely
have we used our liberty in the
construction
of our political system; but in much else
we have been blind to its value or we have
abused it. Original in our principles of
government
,
we are in our manners and many
of our habits servile imitators. The result is,
the littleness inseparable from any imitation of
the kind, and the awkwardness which is the
effect of its unfitness, superadded to the
native
vulgarity of the foreign original. We set
up the idol fashion, and we worship it in the
spirit of exclusiveness;a false idol, even
where it is rendered imposing by the
prestiges
of custom and the pomp of aristocratic
circumstance,a mean spirit even where the
worship is sanctioned by national institutions
and hereditary usage. Here, where the idol
standsnot on the high pedestal of
time-honored
privilege, crowned with precious
stones and shining in rich robes,but on the
shallow basis of ephemeral pretension,
unadorned
,
in naked deformity,the worship is
self-degradation.
Come, Alfred, interrupted Mrs.
Vernon
,
you view the subject too seriously.
The monster fashion is a very harmless
monster
;
fantastic, if you please, but nothing
more. The worst of fashion is its folly.
You give it respectability by making it of
so much importance. Ridicule is weapon
enough for it, said Mr. Seldon.
You are too severe, said Mr. Penniman.
Entirely so, said the Doctor.
Were the social defect, resumed Alfred,
to which I allude, on the surface,a mere
partial disfigurement of bad taste,a blister,
without depth; the fine point of ridicule were
enough. Or, were it nothing more than the
impertinence of a few pretenders, aiming at
the hollow distinctions of ostentation;
contempt
alone would be its due: it would not
move indignation. These are but symptoms:
4
the disease is deep-seated. In every
community
,
(this for example,) in that portion
of it which should be the freest, there is a
slavery of the minda double slavery; to the
object which is little, and to the means to
attain
it which are debasing. The object is,
the outward shows, the public sensualism, if
I may so speak, of life: the means are, the
soul-absorbing, soul-contracting gathering of
wealth. The mind is sold, that the body may
be gaudily decked. What is called fashionable
life is wholly corporeal. For what is the
intercourse
of the self-important actors in it
more than the mechanical movements and
automaton mutterings of puppets
etiquette
being the wire that guides them? What are
their equipages and halls but so much
superfiuous
raiment? Means and leisure which
might be profile, are barrenly dedicated to
empty nothings. The substantial goods of
existence,the gladdening, the
heart-purifying
,are
cast away: and not even is the
outward
form of beauty acquired; for polish and
grace no more follow wealth, than does the
possession of a library imbue its possessor
with literature. Manners should flow from
within: their only pure source is in the heart
in high and proper feeling. The manners of
outward putting onthe factitious
accompaniment
of conventional observance, are to the
ease and frank bearing which unconsciously
attend a cultivated mind, what the changeless
color of a painted cheek is to the tint of na
ture varying with the heart's impulses.
This coarse poison which thus blotches
the face, as it were, of the social body,
pervades
other of its limbs. The small circle,
drawn in the spirit of exclusiveness by
vulgar
vanity, casts a glare over a wide
circumference
.
To a crowd without its jealous
limits, it is radiant with attraction; to those
particularly, upon whom fortune has sprinkled
her golden dust, the object of envy and
admiration
and hope. Seeing that gold is its
basis, as well as the stuff of which its
ornaments
are made, they task both mind
and body to produce that which is the
smoothest key to open its barriers, and the
surest source of brilliancy when within them.
What a waste of energy! What a
prostitution
of mind! What a shallow result! What
an unprofitable existence!
This is very well as satire, Alfred, said
Mr. Vernon. But it is as applicable to a
European as to an American city. It has no
peculiar fitness to ourselves.
It has a peculiar fitness to ourselves,
answered
Alfred. We are a republic: Europe
is aristocratic. The forms and modes of
social
intercourse and occupation there, have
grown out of political institutions: they are
the leaves that are fed and take their shape
and hue from old deep roots. We are free,
alike from the necessity imposed by laws, and
from the habit of centuries. The class here
which has leisure, is called by circumstances
and ambition as well as by duty and taste, to
self-improvement. It does not heed or it
does not understand the call. It has no zeal
to rise, but grovels in the dirtits desires
ending in avarice, its aspirations in
ostentation
.
After a few remarks from Mr. Penniman
and Dr. Walsall, neither of whom, however,
attempted to continue the subject in this
strain, the conversation became political.
Mrs. Vernon made a movement to rise,
saying
,
that Miss Walsall and herself would
leave the gentlemen to politics. Mr.
Penniman
protested against such a double
infliction
:
this separation, he said, was a Vandal
custom, and politics were under any
circumstances
the bane of good company. Some
one proposed that it be put to the vote
whether the gentlemen should leave the table
with the ladies.
Voting is so vulgar, said Mr. Penniman.
That's a good thought, said Mr.
Vernon
,
not noticing the comment of Mr.
Penniman
.
Alfred, Mr. Penniman, and Herbert, were
for accompanying them: Mr. Seldon and the
Doctor against it.
4*
Three to two, gentlemen, said Mr.
Vernon
,
rising; and the whole party went into
the drawing room.
There the conversation reassumed a lighter
character. After some time, Dr. Walsall
asked if any of the gentlemen were going to
Mrs. Gore's; it was time to think of it if they
were. Mr. Barclay, you are, I am sure, and
you, Mr. Seldon, are you not?
No; I believe not, said Mr. Seldon.
But I recommend to Mr. Barclay to go. It
will amuse him, and a young man should go
through a course of balls.
Yes, said Alfred; as he does through a
course of metaphysics. They are both parts
of a liberal education, and one is as
profitable
as the other.
Fie, Alfred, cried Mr. Vernon, you are
as bad as a merchant,always calculating
profit and loss.
Besides, said Mrs. Vernon, there is
profit
as well as amusement in such a scene to a
young man. You think so much is to be
learnt, Alfred, from mixing freely with all
classes of men; you will admit that the study
of women is not without instruction.
The study of women! A young man
studying women! said Alfred. Herbert,
can you with your naked eye see the spots on
the sun at mid-day? You can do that as
easily
as you can see what a woman really is.
No man, Alfred, said Mrs. Vernon,
young or old, can fix his eyes on the sun at
mid-day, so that your illustration is not good;
for you surely wont assert, that no man can
understand a woman.
He can look undazzled at the sun rising
or setting; so I advise you, Herbert, to stay
here and study Mrs. Vernon and her
daughter
,
said Alfred.
Mrs. Vernon, one of whose children was
by her side, was still beautiful at thirty-five.
To attract the attention of the company
towards
her in this way, was an indirect
compliment
:
had it not been so, Alfred would
not have done it.
You shall not escape, returned Mrs.
Vernon. You ca'nt support your
illustration
.
Yes, I can, said Alfred. I did not say
a man cannot gaze at the sun at mid-day; but
that he can not do it with his naked eye.
He can do it through a smoked glass.
A smoked glass!
Yes. The smoked glass of a man before
the dazzling being of woman, is his own
darkened heart. Disappointment cleanses
his brain of bewildering fancies. The
mariner
approaches the glittering form floating
majestically across his path: it is an iceberg.
Too late he discovers his peril, when
wrecked
on its treacherous roots spread invisible
under him. Fortunate if he escapes with
life,ever after to fly when its glancing rays
meet his sight.
You carry such a glass, yourself, do you
not Mr. Grey? said Mr. Penniman.
Mr. Penniman would have liked to have
some deflecting substance before his own
eyes to turn aside the look Alfred gave
him.
Come Mr. Barclay, said Dr. Walsall, let
me have the honor of presenting you at Mrs.
Gore's.
Be my knight, Mr. Barclay, added his
daughter.
Herbert gave his arm to Miss Walsall, who
took her leave.
I got the better of you, Mr. Grey.
said the Doctor, as Herbert went out of the
room, notwithstanding your camera obscura
of the heart and your similes.
Ah! Doctor, retorted Alfred, you are
accustomed to mistake the triumphs of nature
for your own.
CHAPTER III.
A YOUNG sailor gliding down the current
which bears him to the untried sea, was
never more gay of heart than was Herbert,
embarked now on the stream of amusement.
Inasmuch as our simile adopts the common
likening of human existence to the ocean, it is
defective; for what is called a life of pleasure
is too shallow to float a burden heavy enough
to withstand a storm. We shall therefore
change it, and compare such a life to an
artificial
lake, or rather, pond, fed from small,
and not the purest sources; not deep enough
to swell majestically in unison with the
tempest
,
although the frivolous admire its ripples,
and the weak may be drowned under them;
pretty at a distance, but from its stagnant
surface exhaling a treacherous miasma.
Herbert walked in the streets in the
morning
;
was almost daily a guest at dinner
companies
;
and passed most of his evenings at
balls, or other less numerous assemblages,
called
conversational or musical.
The manner in which he spent his time
caused no dissatisfaction to his uncle.
Mr. Barclay had studied and practised life
thoroughly. Every day of his ownand he
was past fiftyhad been a day of instruction.
At his outset, he had had many external
difficulties
to contend against, and his feelings
had added others. He married early: this
made his struggle in the world the more
arduous
,
and his disappointments the more
oppressive
.
His friends said it was an
imprudent
act:not once, in his hardest moments,
when poverty seemed to dog him like an
enemy, smiting his toilsome endeavors with
barrenness, did he himself regret it. He
now would say:that marriage in young
people is seldom of itself imprudent,the
pairing of couples is often unfortunate,
but that there is for every human being a
mate that would make him better and
happier
,
could each find out the one designed by
nature for himself, and that the better a man
is, the larger is the number that would
suit him; that elderly people who never have
been married, are the only ones who should
not marry. Worldly parents who looked
upon marriage as something to be weighed
and measured like an article of commerce,
expectant old bachelors and maids; and some
others, wondered how a man of Mr. Barclay's
sense could entertain so absurd a theory on
this subject. He applied it to both sexes.
Few men can properly be called men of
much experience; for experience implies
great variety and great quantity of trials.
The trials of most men are limited in both
respects; not from absence of opportunity,
but from want of capability. Many are too
timid, many too indolent, many too selfish, to
involve themselves in a diversified activity:
some have not the strength of feeling to
engage
deeply in life, and some, not intellect
enough to support them if they desire to do
so: thus some suffer much and learn little;
while others, from coldness of nature, suffer
little, but deceive themselves with the conceit
that they learn much. How few are those
who explore the physical varieties of the
earth's surface. It is the same with the
world of mindthe world of feeling and of
thought. It, too, surrounds every one; but
how partial is the knowledge that each
obtains
of it. The hopes, the fears, the
pleasures
,
the daily ongoings and peculiar
existence
of the great mass of their neighbors,
are as little known or cared for by most men,
as are the vegetable and mineral peculiarities
of an adjacent territory. Many are the
inhabitants
of the plain who have never been
awed by the thunder of the cataract; not less
is the number of those who have never
thrilled
with fellow-feeling for a passion-rent heart:
the grand spectacle of mountain piled on
mountain stretching up miles through the
5
clouds, is not less often enjoyed through the
external sight, than is the deep inward sense
of uncalculating benevolence, exalting him,
who feels it, far above the little egoism of
common
life: the misery of social destitution is
unknown
to as many, as the intense fearfulness
of the wrecking storm. Hence, the minds of
few men expand with age. They grow skilful
in performing the routine of life, as the
journeyman
mechanic does at his trade; but, few
attain by experience even to knowledge
parallel
to that of the master mechanic, and, still
fewer, to the deep insight into principles,
and the comprehensive view of proportions,
which distinguish and delight and elevate the
artist.
Mr. Barclay was one of the latter. In
early life, his young impulses had been given
a scope that would peril the moral being of
most men: indulgence had strengthened, not
weakened his. As contention brings out
truth where there is power to perceive it, the
contest of his higher against the solicitations
of his animal feelings developed more
decidedly
his innate excellence. He, at first,
when his life had taken a more steady course,
looked back with shuddering at the escapes
he seemed to have made; but he afterwards
obtained a clearer view of himself, and
became
satisfied that he had never been in
danger
of ruin. He even went so far as to
believe
,
that had not accidental connexions led
to the circumstances and engagements and
acts which now formed the frame work, as it
were, of his life, innate desires and
dispositions
would have produced others similar to
them in character; thus ascribing not only
the direction of his career, but even much
of what is called accidental, to his internal
nature instead of to external associations.
This was a particular conclusion in regard to
himself. He did not state it as a general
truth; he believed it, however, to be much
more frequently and strongly applicable than
it is commonly thought.
He had often shared with riotous
companions
in scenes of levity and looseness: the
flooding tide of young passion had swept him
into the dark caves where vice creeps that it
may not see its own shadow. But he emerged
again: satiety brought a deeper pain than
transient disgust; and the vigorous growth
of his moral and intellectual nature, cast out
the taint that poisons the core of many. He
had stood on the precipice to which
indulgence
leads, and had looked into the abysses
that yawn around it: the sights he had seen
and the pangs he had felt, revealed to him
fearful but pregnant secrets. He had
fathomed
the depths of animalism without being
engulphed
by it, and had thus the experience
without the forfeits of its victims.
Those who escapewhether they avoid or
resist, or, yielding, pass unwithered and
unweakened
through the temptations to
licentious
enjoyment in youth, are awaited for
when they engage more actively and
responsibly
in life, by other dangers, less obvious,
and less dreaded because undiscerned, but
not less real, than those which threatened
their well-being from the untempered
gratification
of animal desires;the dangers of
selfishness. The half knowledge which
deliberately
distrusts, is as fatal as the
self-abandonment
of passion. The prudence which
seeks safety by narrowing the outward
avenues
of the heart, is as destructive of
happiness
,
as the dissipation which wastes the
fresh treasures of feeling. These dangers
Mr. Barclay escaped as securely as he did
the first. Through failure and success he
passed uncorrupted Disappointment did not
sour him: the treachery of a few did not
pervert his judgment: from adversity he
learnt charity as well as prudence:
prosperity
brought him no triumphs.
Collision
with his fellows polished without
hardening
him. His sympathy with human
nature
enlarged with his knowledge of it.
His trials not only purified his own heart;
they taught him tolerance of the errings of
others. He did not learn the existence and
5*
nature of virtue merely from his
consciousness
,
or from the happy few who daily
practise
it: he discerned its germs even through
the rank growth of iniquity.
To the knowledge he imbibed from active
intercourse with men, he added that which
is acquired from a secondary sourcefrom
books, those imperishable mirrors which
reflect
the being of man in all its conditions. He
had received the usual quantity and kind of
expensive instruction, and at the age of
eighteen
had taken a degree at one of the most
frequented colleges. He soon discovered
that he had learnt very little at the latter,
although
he graduated with honor. He was
immediately put to study law, and at
twenty-one
was admitted to practice. His father
designed, now, that he should travel for two
years in Europe. In this design, however,
his own wishes and plans did not concur.
He married,suddenly, it appeared to his
family and friends, who learnt his attachment
and engagement only a few days before the
marriage took place. The lady who became
his wife he had met for the first time about
six months before in the hovel of a poor
family.
The impression of her character, which the
circumstances of this meeting were calculated
to make on a mind like his, was deepened by
the force of beauty. They soon knew and
loved each other. She was an only child,
and, by the recent death of her mother, an
orphan, with a small income, the greater part
of which she paid for living in the house of
a coarse uncle. Her first meeting with Mr.
Barclay was the dawn of a new existence to
her,not of the transient illumination merely,
which suddenly brightens the opening path of
manhood and womanhood, when the
strongest
passion of nature reveals itself, quickening
the whole being, and sometimes leaving the
soul the darker for its devouring energy;
but, of the lasting brightness which flows
from the union of kindred hearts, and flows
as long as the union lasts. The vulgarity and
roughness of her uncle were repugnant to
her. Family afflictions during the life of her
parents, had humbled her mind. Intercourse
with Mr. Barclay moved its deep sources:
her clear genial nature expanded like a
drooping
rich flower, long deprived of the sunshine
and moisture designed to evolve its beauty.
For several years Mr. Barclay struggled
with adverse circumstances. Soon after his
marriage, his father suffered by a law suit
a heavy loss of fortune, by which his
allowance
was reduced to a trifling sum. He
was faithful in the execution of whatever
business was entrusted to him, and his
talents
were acknowledged; but the initiatory
drudgery of a profession was hateful to him,
and he gave much of his time to engagements
which, although they demonstrated his value
as a citizen, repelled rather than attracted
clients; he was, too, more liberal in gifts of
private charity and public spirit than suited
his limited means. He had reached his
twenty-eighth year, when his father died.
The property he became possessed of by this
event, added to his wife's small income and
his earnings, was a competency, and, with
their moderate habits and wishes, it was more.
Of his new means, and the liberty he acquired
with them, he made a use that to most
persons
seemed eccentric, and to many
imprudent
.
He travelled for several years.
Since he had become a man, he had been,
in the enlarged sense of the word, a student;
investigating science and literature to satisfy
the craving of his mind. He sought in books
to learn the nature of man and of the physical
elements that surround him. He readnot
to be informed of the opinions of men; but
to obtain knowledge of their feelings and
capacities
,
and the practical results of these: he
interrogated nature to admire her beauties
and learn her resources. A natural part of
the course of study into which his mental
wants thus led him, was travel. He traveled
to observe the modification of humanity in its
divisions into nations, and, like Pythagoras,
to converse with the wisest of the most
advanced
communities. After devoting some
time to visiting portions of his own country
that he had not yet seen, he spent four years
in Europe, sojourning in capitals and
traversing
those parts that are most interesting from
the character and doings of the inhabitants, of
the picturesqueness of the scenery. With
cheerfulness on his return home, he resumed,
after so long an interruption, the practice of
his profession. Instead of repining at the
necessity of recommencing labor, he set
himself
down to it contentedly, grateful that
circumstances
had permitted him to give such a
scope to his curiosity. That had been
satisfied
.
His mind had been fully and richly fed.
Most profitably as well as delightfully he had
spent nearly the whole of his patrimony, and
he now gave his time to supplying the want
of it with more zeal than he had labored in
the beginning of his career, and with a
prospect
of success which his enlarged and
matured
powers, supported by industry,
rendered
certain. He had just begun to realize
this prospect, when, a relation of his wife
dying, left her, unexpectedly, a sum which
much more than replaced the diminution of
his own fortune. Upon this, he abandoned
his profession, and bought in the
neighborbood
of the city a small tract of woodland
where he created the residence already
described
.
To a young man of worth, it was a
privilege
and a happiness, to be the inmate of Mr
Barclay's house. Herbert valued his
situation
,
although it was only later, in
retrospection
,
that he fully appreciated its advantages.
Mr. Barclay had a bright confidence in life,
a happy, joint, result of temperament and
reflection; he thought well of his nephew's
capacity and disposition; he had himself run
the round of superficial amusement which now
engrossed his nephew's time; Herbert was
under his daily observation and influence: the
result of all which was, that he even took
pleasure
in observing this temporary dissipation,
his sympathy in whatever Herbert enjoyed not
being disturbed by any apprehensions of
consequences
.
The thought that he might
misplace
his affections and marry unsuitably,
crossed Mr. Barclay's mind; but this was a
thought that could not but suggest itself to
any one interested in any young person in any
circumstances; and he was too wise to permit
himself to be disquieted by general fears.
Mr. Barclay's warm concern and liberality
won the affection of Herbert as entirely as his
general kindness and fine intelligence
commanded
his respect. It was a pleasure to the
nephew to be communicative with his uncle
respecting himselfhis feelings and conduct,
as well as his opinions; and so lenient did he
find him, that instead of apprehending blame,
Herbert had recourse to him for palliation in
times of self-reproach.
CHAPTER IV.
A community
that has reached a state
which implies an extensive cultivation of the
resources of human nature, presents much
variety in the characters of the individuals
and classes of individuals produced in its
bosom
.
The further the advance from
barbarism
,
the greater will be this variety. Savage
life is same. Its surface has little
diversity
,
because its depths are not stirred.
Only a few primitive springs of action are
braced in it, and the motion which these
impart
,
although vigorous, and differing in
degrees
of vigor, is, in each individual, in the
same direction. A tribe of savages differs as
much and in the same manner from a civilized
community, as a prairie with its growth of
6
uniform wild grass does from a domain of
variegated culture, where the fertile resources
of the soil, developed by tillage, present that
rich result which capacious nature always
yields to cunning art.
As the numerous and various faculties,
barely awakened in the savage state,emerge
into activity, they create a field for their own
operation. The interests and sympathies,
the occupations and pleasures, that multiply
with civilization, while they are the effect of
the enlargement of man's mental capacity, at
the same time afford him, in proportion to
their multiplicity, scope for the employment
of his intellect and the gratification of his
feelings. The numerousness of the sources
whence the craving faculties are solicited, and
the infinite combinations which the number
of the latter and the degrees of their power
admit of, necessarily cause great variety in
the objects of action, in the modifications of
opinion, in the manifestations of feeling, and,
consequently, great diversity in character.
The stronger and more pervading the
impulse
at the common centre of all human
doings, the mind,the more numerous and
the longer will be the radii of thought and
deed that proceed from it; and, like the
beams from the sun, the further these stretch,
the wider will be the distance between them,
however, design, for specific ends, may
combine
their agency.
In a thriving community like one of our
towns, this effect is conspicuous. A large
American city embraces the great results of
the advanced civilization of the age,the arts
which minister to comfort and elegance,the
institutions which, in addition to the
provisions
of government, philanthropy and
intellectual
enterprise establish for the protection
and progress of society. The tendency to
uniformity produced by the spirit of
accumulation
,
naturally so active in a new country, is
more than countervailed by the healthful vigor
imparted by multiform exertion; and the
expansion
of individual dispositions encouraged
by unprecedented freedom of thought and
action.
Although by the constitution of human
nature
,
moral improvement follows the
enlargement
and diffusion of knowledge, its progress
is slow. The waters of life, even when
most tranquil, cast up constant impurities;
and in the strong stirrings of them, ultimately
productive of good, so much of the impulse
is given by the self-seeking feelings, that often,
the deeper their motion the thicker and more
turbid are they, and thence the more capable
of bearing the gross burdens of selfishness
that are launched upon them. These float
here the more successfully, because in the
wide field for
material
effort temptingly
displayed
in a new territory to a young people,
armed with all the
immaterial
power of the
oldest, there is more scope for coincidence
between private selfishness and public benefit.
He, who is capable, industrious, energetic,
will obtain credit and consequence, although
his character be faithfully described in these
words of an old writer:All other passions
he sacrifices to his ambition: he laughs at
disappointments
,
is inured to refusals, and no
repulse
dismays him; this renders the whole
man always flexible to his interest: he can
defraud his body of necessaries, and allow no
tranquility to his mind, and counterfeit, if it
will serve his turn, temperance, chastity,
compassion
,
and piety itself, without one grain of
virtue or religion: his endeavors to advance
his fortune
per fas et nefas
are always
restless
,
and have no bounds, but when he is
obliged to act openly, and has reason to fear
the censure of the world.The boldness of
conceit and the confidence of tried sagacity
urge him into notoriety, where skill in
dissimulation
enables him so to profit by the
general esteem of practical industry, as to
appear
the very personification of public spirit,
while his thoughts are unceasingly, without
momentary divergence, concentrated upon
one single object,so to plan and direct his
acts, that all of them, the smallest and the
6*
largest, shall contribute to his personal
advancement
.
Every movement he makes in
life is designed to tend to this result. A step
which is discovered to lead from it, is quickly
retraced. He will abjure opinions,sacrifice
friends,pervert truth,fabricate falsehood,
say any say, do any deed, which may be so
said or done as not to come with a shadow
between him and the sole source whence he
derives animating light,public opinion. By
respecting the forms of morality; by
captivating
individual favor through flattery; by
timing as well the ostentation of humility as
of triumph; by watchfully studying
appearances
;
by letting no occasion escape for
making
what is
wait upon
what seems;
it is
inconceivable
,
by an upright mind, ignorant as
well as innocent of the arts of worldly
rising
,
what consideration may be obtained, and
sometimes for a long while retained, by a man
morally worthless. Such a man was Hugh
Langley.
When Herbert, after the dinner of Mrs.
Vernon's, entered Mrs. Gore's rooms with
Miss Walsall on his arm, Langley was among
the few guests already assembled. As
quickly
as his sight was his mind fixed upon them.
He did not know Herbert. He moved
nearer
to Mrs. Gore to hear his name. He then
addressed Miss Walsall with a manner of
mingled respectfulness and familiarity, and
with a smile which invariably attended his
approach to any one, as the wag of his tail
does that of a spaniel. This smile habit had
rendered involuntary, and it was in so far
natural. The first moment the attention of
Herbert was directed from them, he
whispered
to Miss WalsallIntroduce me to Mr.
Barclay; which she did, and then,
withdrawing
her arm from Herbert's, asked him
to come to her presently, as she wished to
introduce him to some ladies. Langley
immediately
with a very cordial manner,
engaged
in conversation with Herbert; spoke of
his uncle in warm terms of esteem; of his
studies and amusements at the university,
responding
to his remarks with anecdotes of
his own college life, invited Herbert to visit
him unceremoniously at his office, saying that
he should give himself the pleasure of calling
on him at his uncle's in a day or two; and
concluded by presenting him to several
gentlemen
near them; so that Herbert when he
rejoined Miss Walsall, thanked her for so
sociable and intelligent an acquaintance.
Herbert was the object of general
attention
.
He inherited from his parents a
standing
at once respectable and fashionable, which
his own qualities were well calculated to
support; and the high esteem universally
entertained
for his uncle, strengthened the
favorable
disposition towards him. Mrs. Gore's
party was the occasion of his introduction to
the fashionable society of the town. Mothers
and aunts, especially, took a lively interest in
him; and it is no imputation upon their
daughters and nieces, that his fine face was
by many of them transported to an important
position in their aerial castles.
He became at once a favorite with the old
and young of both sexes. A party was
incomplete
without him, and some were given
in compliment to himself. He was
intoxicated
,by
the liveliness of the scenes,by the
beauty of women,by the smiles that played
around him,by the brilliancy, in a word, of
the spectacle; for life is at first but a
spectacle
,
when entered through the halls of
fashionable
pleasure. Gay appearances only,
present themselves: reality is but superficially
or partially perceptible. Whatever is harsh,
or mean, or painful, or discordant, or
inelegant
,
is kept out of view: the experienced
know of their existence: to Herbert they
were not only invisible, but unknown. The
young savage who issues from his woods to
the sea, and lying down on its sunny shore,
enjoys the delicious exhilaration of its waters
breaking gently over him, dreams not that the
wave which laves his body, may have swept
over a wreck, or fed a monster, or echoed the
thunder of human conflict.
The conduct of Langley at Mrs. Gore's
requires explanation.
In the scheme of worldly elevation, the
prosecution of which was his daily labor, he
reflected, that a wife might be an efficient
coadjutor
.
In this he judged rightly. He who
gains renown through the efforts of pure
intellect
,the
man of science or literature,
derives
no aid to his public career from women;
for he goes not personally into the arena,
he sends his works to contend with rival
works. But the practical politician, who
seeks distinction, brings about his results by
contact,by collision with men. He must
move in concert with, and in opposition to
other men. He must be constantly
personally
visible and active. Hence, his wife can
co-operate with him. If she shares his
ambition
and ability, she can give him direct
assistance
and counsel. Her personal qualities
have scope for influence. His individual
basis
is, too, extended by the addition of her
family to his own. Independently of these
advantages, contingent upon the character
and connections of the woman he marries,
marriage itself obtains for a man a certain
kind of consideration. It adds to his stability
in the public eye. He is looked upon as
having thereby more closely bound himself
to the community; as having taken a deeper
root; and, consequently, as being a safer
dependence
for public confidence.
These considerations were embraced by
Langley's calculating mind. He was
approaching
thirty: he had a standing in his
profession, at the bar, which already secured
to him a good income, and his reputation was
growing. He was now, therefore, himself
well equipped, on his own principle, for
matrimonial
enterprise. He had, accordingly,
a short time before, determined to marry;
and in such a way, if possible, as to unite all
the public advantages of the step.
After a deliberate survey of the circle from
which a choice was to be made, his judgment
rested on Miss Walsall. She was the only
daughter of a man of wealth and influence:
her family connection was extensive and
substantial
:
she was reputed intelligent, and was
personally attractive; and Langley, though
not of the constitution to be strongly
susceptible
of emotions of beauty, and, therefore,
never swayed by it, knew its public value:
her father, he was confident, would favor his
suit, for he was aware that the Doctor had a
high opinion of his talents and prospects. A
few days before Mrs. Gore's party he had
taken
his resolution; and, as with every thing
he undertook, his mind was from that moment
busied in planning the means to carry it into
effect, and with an earnestness proportioned
to the importance of its object. Already had
he made demonstrations towards Miss
Walsall
,
distantly and cautiously. He was
prepared
to continue them, and was watching
for her arrival, when she entered with
Herbert
.
In spite of his habitual self-possession,
a scowl suddenly darkened for a moment his
even brow. He was taken by surprise. Had
he a rival?perhaps more. The hearing of
Herbert's name relieved him. He knew that
he must be a new acquaintance of Miss
Walsall
.
He might, however, become a rival,
and a formidable one. His own part was
instantly
taken. He determined to become
intimate
with Herbert; to attach himself to him
as closely as he could. He would thus have
the means of observing his designs, and,
should they tend to cross his own, of
counteracting
them, if this could be done.

CHAPTER V.
About
a fortnight after the dinner at Mrs.
Vernon's, Alfred Grey went out to Mr.
Barclay's. He had just left Herbert, who
had gone into town early. After a few
moments
,
addressing himself to Mr. Barclay, he
said.
I have come out to have some
conversation
with you about your nephew: I don't
like his associates.
Why, is he not more with you and your
sister than with any other persons? said Mrs.
Barclay.
No: he sees Miss Walsall every day, I
believe; and Langley has taken a violent
affection
for him. I suspect them both: they
are too smooth-faced and smooth-spoken to
be honest.
You know you have confessed being too
suspicious, Alfred, said Mrs. Barclay.
But
we
know, Elizabeth, said Mr.
Barclay
,
that if we were to take Alfred's
confessions
for his own character, he himself
would not be a safe associate for any one.
Suspicion, however, said Alfred, is a
good thing. Have you not found it so in
your experience, Mr. Barclay? It is an
antidote
that counteracts many threatening ills in
life.
I should call it rather, a preventive,
answered
Mr. Barclay; and the wisest of the
faculty, I believe, regard preventives as
seldom
serviceable to the body, urging uniform
temperance as the best security even against
specific dangers.
Are you acquainted with Langley, said
Alfred.
Only superficially.
Do
you
know him? said Mrs. Barclay to
Alfred.
Personally, not further than Mr. Barclay
does: but I know that he is cunning and a
flatterera pretty good foundation to build a
scoundrel upon.
And Miss Walsall, Alfred, said Mr.
Barclay, what do you know of her; her
father is one of the wise men of the town.
Do you mean that for satire on the
Doctor
or the town?Of his daughter I know
little: she is pretty and graceful, and has
what is called good mannersthat is, she is
unembarrassed in company and dispenses
smiles on all who approach her.
Your sister is intimate with her and likes
her, does she not? inquired Mrs. Barclay.
Oh!Ellen is intimate with and likes
every body. I tell her, she is the loosest
person in her acquaintances I know.
I wish to get some knowledge of the
character of Miss Walsall, said Mr.
Barclay
.
Herbert, who is not disposed to
conceal
any thing from us, has spoken frequently
of her as of others, and, I think, with a good
deal of admiration. Of course, from him we
can learn little, for he has seen only the
surface
of her mind, which seems to be as
smooth as her face.
And he is not likely, said Alfred, to
see much farther, after a longer acquaintance.
The city intercourse of young people brings
only their surfaces in contact. They never
meet without preparation: their minds as
well as persons are glossed: they go through
a prescribed routine, in which the individual
characteristics of each can be but partially
displayed: the intellect has some scope,the
feelings scarcely any; and a little art can
make either appear other than they are, to
more practised observers than Herbert.
You come then to the conclusion, said
Mrs. Barclay, that our well-being is the
sport of fortune; all of happiness that
depends
on marriage being abandoned to the
blind impulses of the affections, misled by
the shows of artifice.
In this artificial state, replied Alfred,
such is the case generally; but it is not
necessarily
7*
so. When a danger is known or
apprehended, it may mostly be avoided. Of
those who are thus exposed, few are aware
of their danger; some, probably, could not be
made sensible of it; to many, indeed, it
does not exist, for their natures are so
common
that they risk little, and chance will
provide
for them as well as they can provide for
themselves.
Self-delusion, the source of so much
failure
,
is, I believe, here more to be feared
than any other delusion, or than all others
together, said Mr. Barclay. When the
inclination to it is strong, it is doubtless
encouraged
under the circumstances you
describe
;
but, on the other hand, the
weakening
of it strengthens one against all other
deceptions
and temptations.
Do you think, asked Mrs. Barclay, that
Herbert is particularly liable to this?
Yes: he is hopeful and prone to build up
a future in his mind; and these dispositions,
conjoined with warm feelings, produce a
tendency
to magnify the importance of present
wishes and desires. The latter are
incorporated
with imaginings; they give a substance
to day-dreams, while these beautify them
with bright ideal colors. A mind of this
constitution is peculiarly disposed to
cherish
what has taken hold of itto give
preference to a present probability over all
possibilities of the same nature. All of us
are subject to this kind of delusion, which is
distinct from the egotistical exaggerations of
self-esteem. Herbert, is, I think, somewhat
more so than most persons. He has,
however
,
very good elements of prudence.
All the elements of the mind are
confounded
,
said Alfred, by the tempest which,
at his age, is apt, self-generated like the
whirlwind, to rise up, enveloping alike the
sources and objects of thought and feeling in
mist,
Which leaves them the clearer and
brighter
for its temporary envelopment, said Mr.
Barclay.
Yes:one sees some things the more
distinctly
afterwards, from the devastation that
has swept off other and sometimes better
thingswhich obstructed the view of them.
Love is seldom this madness you make
it, said Mr. Barclay; not even in morbid
temperaments. Its first fervor is tyrannous
enough, to be sure; compelling the strongest
into subjection; but its effects in
disappointment
are for the most part laughable, rather
than melancholy. Let a man risk boldly under
its commandbrave fire and water and the
wrath of man,commit imprudence and
folly
;any
extreme, not inconsistent with
self-respect
,
is pardonable in a man for a woman,
and may be laudable: but if he fail, it
becomes
him not to succomb. To gain a
woman's
love, he may break his neck; but my
dear Alfred, he should not cut his throat if
he misses it. The extravagances he shall
commit in the pursuit, although they be not
practicable, or even proper, in general, are
admired by the world, and are indeed
admirable
,
as being demonstrations of a noble
feeling of manhooddevotion to women:
they are the poetry of life, which awakens the
enthusiasm of all, though few have occasion
to realize it. But his misery under
disappointment
excites, and should excite, little
sympathy. This is no demonstration of
chivalrous devotion, but of moral weakness.
And, be assured, that with few exceptions,
the prolonging of unhappiness from this
source, is the self-torturing of pride. Strong
as my fellow-feeling for Herbert is, I shall
laugh at his love-troubles. My concern is
exclusively for the consequences of success;
and here my apprehensions are not so strong
as those of most persons perhaps would be:
for although I believe that in marriage, there
is much scope for choice, dependant on
individual
peculiarities and relative fitness,
unhappiness
,
I think, seldom flows directly
from marriage. He who has the capacity for
happiness will be happy in spite of
circumstances
,these
affect, but do not control it;
and marriage is but a circumstanceor rather
a train of circumstancesagainst which, as
against others, he can if necessary defend
himself; for the mind in itself can make
a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven. Far
am I from being indifferent whether Herbert
be or be not put to this trial: I would rather
that in his chances in life, his trials should
come from any other source. I therefore
wish that he may not marry blindly, but that
in this, as in every other step in life, he
should move with forethought. Should he
not, fortune may still do for him what he shall
not have done for himself; and if he make
a bad choice, he may still be happy.
And if he have the same wish, said
Alfred, it will be difficult for him to act by
it: he has a good share of impetuosity. How
shall he be put in the way of choosing?
By making him sensible, answered Mr.
Barclay, that he has the power to choose.
It is as much, ignorance of our ability to
resist
a particular inclination, as the force of the
inclination itself, that makes our feelings sway
us against reason and our interest. Young
people believe that love,not the passion
itself
,
for that would be a truth, and one too
deep for their minds to seize,but an
individual
access of it directed upon a particular
person, is irresistible, or resistible only
painfully
and with a wasting cost of misery.
This they learn,partly, from novels,
pretending
to picture human nature, which they
do with as much fidelity and completeness as
the drawing of a single limb, distorted by
muscular effort, pictures the proportions of
the human body,and partly, from the
promptings of their own undisciplined or
mis-developed feelings. Thus, when the
passion
first awakens in their bosoms, they have
no thought that its wild throbbings are ever
to cease. They surrender themselves to it
as to a blessed eternity. They have been
told to distrust it; they have read that it is as
dangerous as it is delightful: but they have
never been made to know that it can be
mastered
;
they have never been even told that
there may be a pleasure in opposing as well
as in yielding to it. Experience alone, I am
aware, can make them fully realize that this,
like other feelings, can be opposed and
mastered
;
but, while nothing can fully supply
the place of personal trial, a knowledge of
their capacity to do so with which it is
possible
to imbue them, may serve much to
temper
their impulses and influence their action.
That this is possible, said Alfred, and
that the result would be as you state, I do
not doubt; but not suddenly. Had your
nephew
,
naturally well endowed as he is, been
educated by yourself, he would, I am sure,
illustrate the truth of your opinion.
I do not look for this, said Mr. Barclay,
nor should I rely upon it, even if Herbert
had undergone, from childhood to the
present
time, a much better course of mental
discipline than he has, so incalculable are, in
an individual case, the effects of combinations
of feelings and of outward influences. My
remark
was general. On the other hand,
instances
of self-control are numerous, where
moral culture has been as defective as in
him,most of them, it is true, the offspring
of necessity, but not on that account the less
indicative of the happy flexibility of the
human
mind.
The point at present of most moment,
said Mrs. Barclay, is, not to determine
whether Herbert can or cannot act with
discretion
in marrying; but to discover whether
Miss Walsall is worthy to be his wife. For,
what is the use of his being able to control
his inclinations unless he can ascertain
whether
in a particular case it will be wise to
control them; and, surely, if
we
cannot find
out what Miss Walsall's real character is, it
is not to be expected that he can, even if he
should not be a lover.
Elizabeth's remark, Alfred, reminds us,
said Mr. Barclay, of the difference between
speculation and practice, and carries us back
to the point whence we startedviz: your
suspicions.
8
Which suspicions, replied Alfred, have
no particular foundation. Only, there is a
worldly character about the family. The
father is ostentatious and formal and
empty-headed
:
his son, you know, deserted a pretty
young girl to marry a plain rich widow: the
daughter looks and speaks like both father
and brother, and I hope is honester and
warmer than either; but until I have strong
evidence, I shall not believe that she is.
It is reasonable, said Mrs. Barclay, that
you should not think well of her without proof
of her merit: neither ought you, without
proof, to condemn her. She is as likely to
be deserving as any other young girl Herbert
knows. This was rather what Mrs. Barclay
wished than what she thought. She shared
the suspicions of Alfred more largely than
she would admit to herself.
Well, Alfred, said Mr. Barclay, it may
be desirable that we should exercise some
influence
in this case; and it may be possible to
find out whether it is desirable; and it may
then be possible to exercise it. This is as far
as we can get just now. In the mean while,
instead of lamenting our inability, let us trust
to the future. It is a wise saying that `
fortune
has a thousand eyes; fools only call her
blind.'
The reflections which this conversation
occasioned
in Alfred, were not confined to
Herbert
.
A short time before, he had received a
shock which at the moment prostrated him,
and threatened to embitter his whole being.
With the vehemence of a susceptible and
uncalculating
nature, he had permitted his
feelings
to become deeply pledged before he
knew whether there was or could be any
reciprocation
;
and had been for a time made to
believe that there was, only to lift him the
higher before his fall. Mr. Barclay felt
strongly for his friend; but did not spare
him. He sometimes administered consolation
to Alfred in the manner in which the surgeon
gives relief to the body. At times he would
revile him, half in jest, for downright
boyishness
for such headlong self-abandonment:
then he would chide him for ingratitude;
you ought to pity her husband, poor man!
I'm sure I feel for him a great deal more than
I do for you, he would say. Such an
opportunity
as this conversation relating to
Herbert
he would not let escape; and,
accordingly
,
a portion of what he said was aimed
at Alfred, who readily appropriated it as it
was intended; and being now in a state to
examine
his own feelings, and beginning to be
ashamed of their extravagance, Mr. Barclay's
observations wrought favourably on himself as
well as on his concern for Herbert.
CHAPTER VI.
When
Alfred walked out to Mr. Barclay's,
Herbert, on parting from him, went to
Langley's
office. Thither he was in the habit of
resorting daily; for Langley had completely
succeeded in bringing about the intimacy he
had sought. Herbert talked to him freely
and listened credulously. He was
confidential
,often
without knowing it; and when
Langley, speaking of himself, described
emotions
of which his mind was incapable,
motives
foreign to his nature, doings where he
exaggerated his own importance, plans of
public interest in which himself was to be the
chief mover, Herbert felt pleased with the
intimacy
and gratified with the confidence of
one, whose feelings were so noble and whose
influence was so extensive. Langley bore
8*
himself towards Herbert in the manner best
calculated to win his confidence and his good
opinion. The direct flattery which the weak
or egotistical absorb with self-complacency,
and which the obsequious hacks, self-hired to
fortune, pour into the ears of the veteran
favorites
of Mammon, to stimulate their vulgar
susceptibilities, he perceived would nauseate
Herbert, who, though unpractised in the
detection
of design, possessed a natural
delicacy
and modesty that rejected what was
gross, however and whence-ever presented.
Langley did not flatter him,he flattered his
feelings. He affected sympathy with his
desires
.
He met the utterance of his undefiled
emotions with such responsive precision, that
Herbert mistook the wordy echo for a
soul-pulsating
accord. Thus, within a week after
their first meeting, they were on a footing of
friendly association. Herbert was more with
Langley than with Alfred Grey.
Alfred held himself aloof from the circle
of, what he called, frivolous ambition, into the
centre of which Herbert had been so suddenly
attracted. Warm in his feelings, and refined
in his tastes, he avoided the shallow
intercourse
which satisfied neither. He was
annoyed
that Herbert, whom he believed to be
capable of high things, should take so much
pleasure in superficial amusement. Herbert,
in a delightful animation from the novelty and
liveliness of the scenes in which he found
himself a prominent actor, felt his excitement
dulled by the tone of Alfred, who mingled
with the damnatory remarks on fashionable
society, which jarred the present feelings of
Herbert, personal satire on his associates
which piqued him. He, therefore, did not
seek Alfred so much as he at first had done;
but gave most of the time that was
unconsumed
by dinners, balls, and visiting, to
Langley
,
who not only had made a very favorable
impression on him, but in whom he always
found a ready ear and responding tongue.
An unconscious cause of the attractiveness
of Langley's society to him, was one of the
subjects of their daily chat, which Langley
never failed to introduce. Langley, who had
closely watched Herbert and Miss Walsall in
public, let no opportunity escape when alone
with Herbert of probing his feelings; and the
growing pleasure he perceived Herbert to
evince when Miss Walsall was the theme of
their social dialogue, confirmed him in the
unwelcome conclusion to which observation
in company had led.
The effect of Langley's first suspicion of
an inclination in Herbert towards Miss
Walsall
was to determine him to be guarded in
his own attentions. For a moment he
considered
whether he could not repulse
Herbert's
first advance by an open and bold
demonstration
on his own part; but he
immediately
reflected, that even should Herbert's
modesty co-operate with this plan, Miss
Walsall
would frustrate it; for that she would not
suffer a young man, so calculated to gratify
her fondness of admiration, to be withdrawn
from her through his own timidity.
Moreover
,
he feared the effect of such a course
upon her disposition towards himself: he had
as yet no hold upon her feelings, and he
judged that one could only be obtained
gradually
and with slow art.
The obstacle which Langley saw thus
unexpectedly
thrust in his way, far from
discouraging
him from prosecuting his new
scheme, stimulated his resolution; for he was
in all things enterprising; and the selfishness
which suggested the design, incited him, by
another impulse of its flexible activity, to
thwart any one who might, however
innocently
,
balk its execution. He risked nothing,
and the defeat of a rival wonld swell the
pleasure of triumph.
When Herbert entered Langley's office,
he found Mr. Penniman there. Langley,
obobserving
that Herbert hesitated whether he
should not retire, exclaimed:We have
finished our business; come in. You are just
in time to save us from the sin of scandal, for
we were talking of you; and 'twould have
been rare if a fashionable man like Penniman
had spoken five minutes of a third person
without saying some harm of him.
I confess, said Mr. Penniman, I was
about to vent some bachelor indignation on
you. What a shame, that a bright young
fellow like you should hide your light under
the bushel of matrimony. I hope, though,
it is only the tattle of this gossiping town.
Mr. Grey was telling me, not ten minutes
since, said Herbert, that as the newest
comer, I must submit to receive a large share
of
The braying of the asses and the
hissing
of the geese. That was his phraseology,
was it not? interrupted Penniman. Your
friend Grey says, that gossip begotten of
idleness
by malice is nurtured by ignorance: he
is a fellow of most unsavory similes. But
seriously, Barclay, I am concerned,not on
your account, for I'll make no affection of
that sort,but on my own, that you should
think of following the common herd into the
pen of marriage. I should be sorry to part
company with you. A man is obliged to turn
selfish in self-defence when he is married.
You would be totally lost, too, to the world.
It's a pity a promising fellow like you should
be so soon spoilt in that way. Take you
pleasure first. Where do you see happier
men than myself and Langley? A little love,
like a little wine, raises a man's spirits very
pleasantly; but matrimony is an excess of it,
which, like a debauch, sinks him below par.
Why Penniman, said Langley, since
when have you turned misogamist? I have
heard you discourse quite musically in a
different
key, and that not many months back.
The report then is true, rejoined
Penniman
,
that you, too, are in the sentimental
vein just now. Well, I have some influence
with Miss Walsall, and I shall use it to defeat
you both.
Miss Walsall! exclaimed Herbert
involuntary
.
Ha! ha! ha! Here you have a specimen
of the impertinence and veracity of a gossip,
said Langley.
Impertinence, forsooth! cried
Penniman
.
Yes: impertinence to Miss Walsall, said
Langley. Such a report is nothing to
me
It seems to be something to our friend
Barclay, said Penniman. And I suspect it
will be something to Mary Walsall. We
shall all meet at the Doctor's this evening,
and I'll ask her. She shall know, too,
Langley
,
of your gallant indignation at the
impertinence
of the town towards her for believing
that she has added you to the list of her
lovers
.
You are incorrigible, Penniman, said
Langley. When you know him as well
as I do, Mr. Barclay, you wo'nt mind what
he says.
Mr. Barclay wo'nt mind what any body
says, said Penniman, when he knows the
world as well as we do, Langley: he'll learn
to set the eyes to watch the ears. I never
believe what I hear; only what I see. This
is a golden rule, Barclay. It makes one
independent
.
But it is an independence like that of the
hermit, said Langley, who needs nothing
because he gives nothing. If you consort
with your fellow-men, they must put faith in
you, and you in them; and, putting faith in
them, you must believe their words. To
gain independence by distrust, is as if you
drowned yourself for the pleasure of a bath.
Aye, but I do'nt drown myself,
answered
Penniman; and for this very reason,
that I freight not my bark in partnership.
The entanglements of the passions and the
dependences of confidence are the shoals and
rocks that wreck happiness. I float
buoyantly
on the surface of life, taking my
pleasure
,
not deeply, but gaily, and safely,and
what is not safe is not pleasure. For this I
need neither to trust nor to be trusted. The
world is to me my inn where I take my ease,
and pay for it.
9
What the cold service of an inn is to the
comfort of the private fireside, said
Langley
,
such is the enjoyment of mercenary
pleasure to the steady happiness of hearty
affection. And, even were it possible to buy
the best pleasures with money, how few are
there who could possess them: the daily
labor
of most is just sufficient to earn the
necessaries
of life. But nature's laws are not
so niggard, as that the happiness of man
should be dependent upon the amassing of a
superfluity. Within himself he bears the
seed of enjoyment, which, rightly cultivated,
brings forth richly without the manure of
outward wealth.
Nor does nature, said Penniman,
prohibit
me from using the means I possess after
my own fashion for my own pleasure. She
prohibits the abuse of every thing. If I
injure
no one, I commit no abuse. And I
avoid committing any, because my
gratifications
are independent of others' interests.
The temptations to selfishnessto sacrifice
others to ourselvesare little in my way,
because
I depend not on others' feelings and
wishes nor they on mine. My pleasure gives
pain to no one. I let the world take its
course and I take mine; and surely, if each
one in it made himself as contented as I am,
t'would be a happier world than it is. To
effect the general happiness, the best means
is for every individual to provide for himself
and let others alone.
This is impossible, said Langley. Let
a man centre his wants and pleasures as
pointedly in himself as the most exclusive
selfishness can demand; still, singly, he not
only cannot provide for himself, but he will
affect the being of the most unconscious
ministers
to his gratification. He cannot let
others alone. Though all around him are
willing hirelings that he pays daily, still, he
binds himself to them and they to him: the
bond is mutual interest. A chain joins them,
though it be the artificial chain of gold.
This conducts the spirit of sympathy, which,
as I have heard your uncle say, Mr. Barclay,
pervades the whole human race, constituting
it ONE, present in every individual of the
universal whole, now manifesting itself in
intense
lightning, and now exhibiting its power
by the moral languor which attends its feeble
action, but never totally absent in any sane
being.
Here the conversation was arrested by the
entrance of one of Langley's clients. To
neither of them was the interruption
unacceptable
.
Penniman had not zeal enough to
take interest in an abstract discussion, and
was beginning to feel the prolonging of it a
bore. He immediately rose, telling Langley
as he went out, that he would leave him to
the amassing of a superfluity. Langley
cared as little as Penniman for the solution of
a moral problem; for, of the native worth and
majestic beauty of truth, he had as clear a
sense as the trader had of honesty, who at
the end of a prosperous career declared that
cheating does'nt thrive; honesty is the best
policy: I have tried both. But he was of
an active mind that grappled willingly with
any subject, and being ambitious, he was
ever eager to join issue where there was
opportunity
for display. His intellect was
cultivated
,
and where his own resources failed,
his good memory supplied him with the
opinions of others, which he quoted with or
without acknowledgment according to
circumstances
.
He had given this turn to the
conversation to evade the bantering of
Penniman
,
and was glad to make his escape
complete
.
To Herbert, the interruption was a
grateful relief. The intimation from
Penniman
that Langley was a lover of Miss
Walsall
,
was a revelation to him. He thought
not of Langley. Jealousy was the unseen
torch that flamed an accumulated heat in his
bosom,itself was enveloped in the sudden
glare it caused. His own feelings were, as
by a flash of lightning, made known to him.
He loved Miss Walsall. He walked from
Langley's office into the street as if
transformed
:
9*
he knew not himself. A change
was suddenly wrought in him that confused
him with a mysterious delight. He walked
on unconscious of volition in a dim
abstraction
.
Ordinary objects passed before him
with the lifeless aspect of a dream's creations.
He had gone beyond the confines of the town
before his mind awoke to distinct
consciousness
.
He turned back with a light step. In
a few moments he was at Dr. Walsall's door.
On entering, he found Langley with Miss
Walsall. He was startled. In Langley's
expression
,
embarrassment followed surprise.
Miss Walsall was alone collected. A smile
spread over her soft countenance between her
two lovers, as if it grew from their
discontent
.
Herbert instantly recovered his
self-possession
.
His discomposure was
superficial
.
The impulse within him was at that
moment too strong to be susceptible of check
from without. He engaged in conversation
with vivacity.
Miss Walsall's manner in company was
fascinating
.
To calm self-commandthe armor
of a ladywas united in her a confiding ease
which held the attention her beauty attracted.
An expression of pleasure spoke from her
countenance more engagingly than words to
those who conversed with her; and the
attentiveness
which proved its sincerity, won still
more by its own charm. Her eye drew to
itself the gaze by its transparence: the
beholder
,
deluded by its lucid intentness, ever
looked to it for more than her words
conveyed
.
She followed rather than led in
conversation
,
which she supported more by the
encouragement she gave to others than by
direct contribution. She captivated through
her ear rather than through her tongue.
Some of her companions were more lively or
more copious talkers; but she was unequalled
as a listener.
The wish to pleasethe predominant one
in her naturewas never stronger than on
this occasion. The attentions of Langley
were no longer equivocal, and Herbert's
interest
in her was equally manifest. She
greeted him in her most winning manner.
The animation of Herbert soon communicated
itself,to her, through her ready facility in
harmonising with the mood of others,and
to Langley, through rivalry. Langley had
never seen Herbert so voluble. He could not
but attribute the change to art. The
discovery
made through Penniman to Herbert,
that he, Langley, was a lover of Miss
Walsall
,
he inferred had determined Herbert to
urge his suit more vigorously, and that under
this influence he had hastened to see her now,
though he was, by invitation, to be at her
house in the evening. The hearty spirit of
Herbert's conversation, he regarded as the
result of this sudden determination. He
himself was actuated by a similar motive, and
although too sagacious to judge Herbert by
himself, he was of too cold a constitution to
ascribe such an effect to the spontaneous glow
of feeling, even had his knowledge of
Herbert's
state of mind been more definite than
it was. However mistaken as to the
immediate
cause of Herbert's visit and conduct, he
knew how to shape his own course in
reference
to them, and accordingly, he at once
raised his mind to a pitch corresponding to
that of Herbert's; for he was capable of
marshalling
in a moment his own powers to meet
circumstances, although the impulse which
moved such a nature as Herbert's was not
always
within the scope of his penetration.
CHAPTER VII.
Herbert
returned to his uncle's to dinner.
Mrs. Barclay was out of doors and met him
near the house. He eagerly unbosomed
himself
to his aunt. She questioned him freely,
and as freely imparted to him her impressions.
They did not join Alfred and Mr. Barclay
until after a full disclosure on the part of
Herbert of the state of his feelings, and a
candid
setting forth by his aunt of the risk he
would encounter by a precipitate surrender to
them. She neither encouraged nor
discouraged
him; but by affectionate interest and
frank discussion, she becalmed his mind.
Without jarring it, she altered its tone. The
deep vibrations of unpractised feeling, she
accompanied
with the clear firm notes of her own
well-tempered mind, with so much skill and
delicacy, that Herbert from listening with
interest
soon yielded to their influence.
The fact that Langley was a rival of
Herbert
,
which the latter did not seem yet
distinctly
to realize, was to her, satisfactory
intelligence
.
Herbert's happy state of mind
made no appeal to her immediate sympathy,
so that her whole concern for him was
concentrated
upon his ultimate welfare; and with
her misgivings respecting the fitness of Miss
Walsall to promote this, the inference she
made from Herbert's relation as to the designs
of Langley, was an agreeable accompaniment
to the report he gave of himself; as, in
addition
to ordinary chances, it presented a
particular
opening through which Miss Walsall's
destiny might be separated from his.
The conversation with his aunt was a
present
relief to Herbert's full bosom, and nothing
was said to either his uncle or Alfred Grey.
Herbert, though from the cause already
stated he was somewhat weaned from daily
intercourse with Alfred, enjoyed the latter's
society, particularly at his uncle's, where he
always listened with pleasure to their
conversation
,
and took part in it without restraint.
Herbert, said Mr. Barclay after dinner,
Alfred and I have been talking this morning
of you and some of your acquaintances
If Mr. Grey, said Herbert, talks to you
of them, uncle, as he does to me, you will
think that I am keeping bad company.
I have provoked you, Herbert, said
Alfred
,
by laughing at most of them; but I
challenge you to name one of whom I have
said any serious harm.
Wellsilly company, said Herbert.
Right, said Alfred. And that has
vexed
you. If I had condemned instead of
ridiculing
them, you would have minded less
what I said.
You would, I dare say, have been as
correct
in the one case as in the other, said
Herbert
.
I do'nt find that these people deserve
your satire.
It is well that you do not, Herbert,
returned
Alfred. It is impossible that you
should know them on so short and superficial
an acquaintance; so that, your concurring with
me, would betoken a proneness to fault-finding
by no means commendable. I must, however,
defend myself against your interpretations.
Your self-love, piqued by my low estimate of
what to you seemed attractive, has attributed
to my ridicule a bitterness which was not in
it.
Nothing, Herbert, said Mr. Barclay,
is more essential to success and happiness in
life than a clear insight into the nature of
those with whom we associate; and you will
find, that to estimate justly the characters of
men, you must at first be chary of good
opinion
.
If you over-rate them at the outset, the
discovery of the error is apt to produce a
greater, hurrying you as much below the
truth as you were before above it; and when
the discovery is made through personal
disappointment
,
as it often is, the re-action is the
stronger.
10
And into error of this kind, said Alfred,
you are the more likely to be seduced, from
the nature of your present association with
people. You see them only at times when
they are robed for public exhibition,when
they have put on smiles,when they are
playing a part,when their behavior is a
masquerade. The clean, shaven citizen gaily
recreating himself on a Sunday, you would
not recognize in the sweating laborer at his
toil.
How can it be otherwise? said Herbert.
I have been but a few weeks in society. It
is impossible, as you say, for me to become
acquainted in so short a time. Every thing is
new to me,the people, the places where I
meet them, the manner of meeting them.
But by degrees I shall learn to known them
better.
Very true, said Alfred. But you will
not attain to this knowledge neither so
certainly
nor so quickly if you begin with
admitting
impressions wide of the truth. And do
you not, while acknowledging your inability
to know at present the real characters of
your new acquaintances, bear in your mind
decided opinions concerning them? You are
not merely ignorantyou are deceived.
It is difficult, said Herbert, not to form
an opinion of a person you meet often,
however
you may want the means of judging
rightly.
Not, answered Alfred, if you carry with
you the conviction that you do want these
means. Thus guarded, you will not be
betrayed
into a hasty judgment.
In associating with your fellow-men,
Herbert
,
said Mr. Barclay, you should seek to
place yourself on an equality with them. Now,
you are at a great disadvantage, if you trust
without knowledge. In imputing evil blindly,
you do yourself a negative injuryyou forfeit
probable advantage; but in expecting good
where it is not, you expose yourself to
positive
loss. You are deceived, injured, ruined
perhaps, and no one is benefited. To think
well of men, and to do them good, are not
only distinct, but often opposed; for, by
misplacing
confidence, you may cripple yourself,
and thus baffle your benevolent purpose.
But, uncle, said Herbert, I have heard
you say, it is only by experiencing the bad
effects of unwise conduct that we gain
wisdom
;
that one can only learn to live by
practice, and that in learning, mistakes,
disappointment
,
suffering, are unavoidable; that
truth can only be reached through error.
Nor is what I have just said, answered
Mr. Barclay, in contradiction with this.
Were you far more sagacious and prudent
than you are, and more willing and able to
guide yourself by the instructions of the
experienced
,
than the best-disposed of your age,
you would still commit blunder on blunder,
and have to atone for them by chargin and
pain. In the best minds judgment is not
intuitive
,
nor to the most docile can it be
transferred
.
Gradually, through personal
endeavor
only, is it to be acquired; and in this
process
of active trial, frequent must be failure to
the most vigilant and cautious. Every step
involves a double danger: you are ever liable
to err in taking it, and your position is liable to
be assailed. Contention is a condition of life.
The philanthropistunless he be a mere
dreameras well as the rude bandit, must
contend. The worker, whether of good or
evil, must attack and defend. Thus exposed,
whatever may be your career, from without
and within, can you be too wary? Even to
those skilled by repeated encounter, the perils
of life are formidable; what must they be to
you, ignorant of their source and nature? Your
safety lies in taking, at first, short steps: long
ones will carry you into the dark, where you
may meet a blow that will stun you, or, have
a load put on you that will burden your
energies
,
or, encircle yourself with a wreath from
which the flowers will soon fall leaving the
chain they concealed to cramp your liberty
for life.
Whenever Mr. Barclay talked, he had in
10*
Herbert an attentive listener. The report
respecting Miss Walsall had put him in a
mood to urge upon Herbert more pointedly
than he was wont to do, the necessity of
circumspection
;
and while he, under this
influence
,
forcibly represented the dangers that
beset the beginner in the world, Herbert
eagerly hearkened to his words, and with
such conviction of their importance, that he
resolved that very evening to derive benefit
from them, and to observe closely Miss
Walsall
and Langley. He doubted not that he
could do it.
He set off with Alfred to return to town,
and Mr. Barclay walked some distance with
them. When, after emerging from the wood
that enclosed the lawn, they reached the
elevation
already mentioned, which overlooked
the city and surrounding country:I
seldom
,
said Alfred, pass this spot that I do
not pause on it. Without being picturesque,
the scene is one to dwell upon. A wide
expanse
of teeming field and rich woodland
with a large city sprung up in the midst of
it, and on one side the landscape stretching
far away without boundary and losing itself
in the vague level of the horizon.
Does not its boundlessness tempt you?
said Mr. Barclay. I believe, Alfred, you
have never been beyond the little world
which the eye from this point embraces.
No: I have not, answered Alfred.
And it is seldom that I feel a wish to go
beyond it. It is, as you have called it, a
little world, and affords full scope to one
whose desires are not for power. Nor
have I, except to behold a few sacred spots,
curiosity to see more of the surface of the
earth or of the people who live on it.
I hope that you are mistaken in yourself,
said Mr. Barclay; and that there is a latent
disposition in you that will make a traveller
of you yet; for I have built a castle in the
air according to which, you and Herbert are
to make a tour together. What do
you
say,
Herbert?
Herbert said nothing, as he had himself
laid the foundation of a fine castle of a very
different character.
I have nothing against such a plan, said
Alfred. Herbert and I will talk it over one
of these days. No doubt you and Keppel
could say enough to start us both. I expect
Keppel this evening, and if he comes I'll
bring him with me to-morrow.
Ah! he's a traveller, said Mr. Barclay.
Come out early, Alfred; your friend and I
will have much to say to each other.
Herbert and Alfred continued their way to
town. Herbert told his friend, as he had
told his aunt, what had passed in the
morning
.
Langley is a scoundrel, warmly
exclaimed
Alfred. Herbert, I'll go with you to Dr.
Walsall's this evening. Does Miss Walsall
know, do you think, what are your feelings
towards her?
No: its impossible that she should.
That isyou have never designedly told
her of them. Did you or Langley leave her
first this morning?
I left Langley with her.
CHAPTER VIII.
Herbert
and Alfred went to Miss
Walsall's
together.
Ha! Mr. Grey, this is an unlooked for
pleasure, cried Dr. Walsall, as they entered.
We owe you our thanks for it, Mr.
Barclay
,
said his daughter, as she received them
with graceful ease and a smile directed to
Alfred, which made his salutation warmer
than he had prepared it.
If the service which Alfred wished to do
his friend, for whom his heart was overflowing
with sympathy, was to have been rendered
through personal interview with Miss
Walsall
,
Herbert could not have had a weaker
ally. Alfred was powerless before a
fascinating
woman. To the influence which a
woman exercises over a man he was
peculiarly
susceptible; and when this power was
wielded by beauty, all that was most
impressible
in his nature was acted on, and prudence
and discernment were made captive. He
was aware of his weakness in this point, and
would often try to strengthen himself against
it when out of the company of women, by
boldly satirising the sex; but this spirit
always
deserted him in their presence. The
cruel disappointment he had himself suffered
from one, left no bitterness in his heart,
though he said that it had; and whatever
suspicion
he may have endeavored to infuse into
Herbert, and however earnestly he may have
warned him against female art, the only
feelings
in his own mind at this moment towards
the sex, were affection and admiration. He
forgot the unfavorable impression he had
taken up respecting Miss Walsall. Not so,
however, with his feelings towards Langley,
whose treachery he thought was evident
from Herbert's account of their intimacy.
His own opinion of his character gave strength
to the suspicion. Langley was talking to
Mrs. Vernon. Alfred went up to them, and
in bowing to Langley fixed on him one of
those full, searching looks, which a mean
mind never can meet steadily. Langley
cowered before it, and soon moved to another
part of the room.
What is there between you and Mr.
Langley, Alfred? said Mrs. Vernon, when
Langley had turned away.
Nothing: I hav'nt seen him for some time,
and wished to admire his beautiful face. But
he is as bashful as a girl,he hung his head.
He blushed too,he
can
blush,though the
blood seems puzzled when it gets to his skin,
what color to put on. See him now talking
to Miss Walsall: he never lets a chance of
profit escape, and has quickly availed himself
of the glow on his cheek to appear ardent to
his mistress, adorning the lover with the
blush of the scoundrel.
What is the matter, Alfred?
Is not Langley a lover of Miss Walsall?
Is he? why I was just now asking him
about the report that your friend Herbert is.
And what did he say?
He said, he did'nt believe it.
They were interrupted by the approach of
Mr. Penniman.
I am glad to see you turn out, Grey, said
he to Alfred. This is your doing, my
charming
Mrs. Vernonyou are always doing some
good. Where's you husband? He stays away,
I suppose, to have the pleasure of hearing
from a hundred people to-morrow, how
beautiful
you look this evening. Your young
friend Barclay gets on famously, Greyover
head and ears in love already they say. Fine
girl, Mary Walsallvery good manners too,
considering: a winter in Paris would make a
charming woman of her. Delightful party
thisselect. Difficult to have a select party
here. Oh! there's that prattling Mrs. Smith
just come inI must go in and speak to her.
Puppy! exclaimed Alfred after he had
gone.
11
In the mean time, Herbert was trying to
be agreeable. He was generally pleasing
in company. A natural flow of spirits
overcame
a more than usual degree of timidity,
and gave a play to his fine talents. But now
the sources of all excitement were absorbed
by one spring which boiled within him; and
not having learnt to talk as a business, he
was obliged soon to turn away from the
group he had joined on entering the room.
He approached Miss Walsall, to whom
Langley was talking with the same kind of
animation which he assumed to address a
juryheightened by his conviction of the
importance and doubtfulness of the cause he
was pleading. The spirit that had spoken
forth so eloquently from Herbert in the
morning, was fled: what had then inspired
him, oppressed him now: the bright flame,
the first outburst of passion,had subsided,
and his now undazzled eyes began to see the
shadows which the light within him cast.
Reflection, had brought suspicion, jealousy,
fear. The advances of Miss Walsall,for a
young hostess can expand the duties of
hospitality
so as to cover a great extent of
encouragement
,though
not without effect, had
not the power to excite him to a renewal of
the conversational rivalry he had so
unconsciously
engaged in a few hours before. He
shrank, too, from a public competition of the
kind: he was withheld by intuitive delicacy
from making such a display of his feelings.
So that, after a few common-place
observations
,
much to the disappointment of Miss
Walsall, and triumph of Langley, he passed
on, and took a seat by Mrs. Vernon.
Langley
had come with the determination to make
his public debut as a lover of Miss Walsall.
He was, accordingly, constant and pointed in
his attentions to her. Nor did he neglect to
pay court to her father, artfully mingling
with flattery, insinuations and representations
of his own importance, so as to leave the
Doctor as strongly impressed with his merit,
as he was satisfied with himself.
I have never seen Miss Walsall look so
well. Is'nt she beautiful? said Mrs. Vernon
to Mr. Seldon.
Whyyes, answered Mr. Seldon
hesitatingly
.
But I admire Miss Astly more.
You don't think her beautiful?
No: not beautiful, said Mr. Seldon.
But better than beautiful. She looks as if
she knew who her great grand-father was.
Ha! ha! I'm sure I dont know who mine
was, said Mrs. Vernon.
I know who all your great grand-fathers
were, said Mr. Seldon. I like a blooded
lady
Mrs. Smith has sent me, Mr. Seldon, to
request that you will come to her in the
other room, said Mr. Penniman, coming up
and interrupting him. She says, she has a
question of importance to ask you.
A question of importance? repeated Mr.
Seldon.
No doubt, a genealogical one, Seldon,
said Alfred to him as he walked away with
Mr. Penniman. Poor Seldon! continued
Alfred, when they were out of hearing.
To be obliged to obey the summons of a
baker's daughter delivered by a tanner's son
at a select soire! No wonder he is pale and
thin. His fine blood retreats from the
surface
to avoid contact with such thick
humored
plebeians. Well, he is very absurd; but
he is not disgusting like Penniman. Any
thing is more bearable than the
self-complacence
of a money-bloated upstart,a
would-be
exclusive. An aristocrat like Seldon, is a
mistaken man here; but the other is
contemptible
,contemptible
from the impotence of
his vulgar ambition. I believe I'll take pity
on Seldon, and go and share with him the
stripes of Mrs. Smith's tongue.
Dr. Walsall and his daughter acquitted
themselves with the ease of frequent practice.
When the Doctor gave a dinner or a party,
he thought he was performing a high duty.
Such entertainments he looked upon as
constituent
parts of elevated social existence;
11*
and deeming himself one of the most
responsible
members of society, he felt bound to
repeat
them often. No doer of charity, after a
day of benevolent exertion, retired to rest
with a more self-approving conscience, than
did the Doctor after a ball at his house. He
felt as if he had done that which it had been
appointed him to do. He certainly did it
well. He was a man of a fine presence, well
built, and always well dressed, with manners
formal but courteous, in which professional
dignity combined with, and in a measure
qualified, a natural tendency to pompousness.
His fondness for hearing his own voice he
could indulge on an occasion like this,
innocently
,
the numerousness of the company
who shared his attention as host, averting
from each individual a burdensome
proportion
of it.
I've just been giving your daughter some
good advice, Doctor, said Mr. Penniman to
him, which I know will have your
sanction
.
What is that? asked the Doctor.
To continue to be an ornament to these
handsome rooms, for at least a half a dozen
years yet.
Sanction such advice,that I will most
cheerfully, answered the Doctor.
So uncivilized are we in America,
continued
Mr. Penniman, that the only chance
a fine woman has of enjoying herself, or
doing
her duty by society, is to keep single for
a short time after she is out of her teens.
Marriage is here the Styx of fashionable life.
Just as a beautiful girl is beginning to shed
her full radiance upon the world, she is
snatched off by some youngster,who
probably
is'nt worth a copper,and you never see
her again, and forget her existence, until you
are reminded of it by meeting her fine eyes
staring at you from the head of a dirty-faced
imp in the street.
What you say, is in a degree true,
replied
the Doctor. But a good deal may be
said in explanation and vindication of our
custom in this respect. In the first place,
there are exceptions
Yes, interrupted Mr. Penniman, and
yonder is one of them. See there, the
lovely
Mrs. Vernon left aloneisolated
absolutely
isolated. Where else could that
happen
?
Excuse me Doctor but I
must
go and
join her.
Notwithstanding the doubts and fears which
Herbert had brought with him, after the
conversations
with his aunt, with Alfred and Mr.
Barclay, and finally with Alfred alone, he
passed a happy evening. So fluctuating are
the feelings of a lover. Despondence was
not of his age or his nature. Jealousy could
keep no hold in his bosom. He soon forgot
to think of the futureto think at all. He
gave himself up to the delicious enjoyment of
the feeling whose birth was a re-creation of
his being. He yielded to its power as
unresistingly
as the young forest bends to the
breeze that visits it with purity and strength.
He gave no utterance to his feelings. His
words to Miss Walsall were the words of
ordinary civilitynot more frequently
addressed
to her by him than by the most
unmoved
of her guests. She was before him, not as
she was before others, but as the embodiment
of his love-illumined fancy. She seemed an
emanation from himself,an Eve taken
from his side. Her voice was the sweet
echo to his inaudible communings. Her form
floated before him as though it had grown
out of a rich dream. So vividly and fixedly
was her image impressed upon his mind, that
it became part of it; and when he went
away, it continued as distinctly present to
him as it had been in the rooms he had left.
CHAPTER IX.
The
next day Alfred went to Mr.
Barclay's
,
accompanied by his friend Mr.
Keppel
,
who, as he expected, had arrived the
evening before.
Herbert had had in the morning with his
uncle a conversation relating to himself. He
will fully understand the impression made by
such a conversation, who has experienced
when in trouble, the influence of one whose
wish to serve does not defeat itself by
over-heated
zeal; but who, uniting warm
fellow-feeling
with self-possession, is as able as he is
willing to give his friend the benefit of a
clear judgment. Mr. Barclay was such a friend
to Herbert. The difference of their ages was
only felt by Herbert in the superiority of his
uncle's experience; while their relationship
gave a sanctity to the affection of Mr. Barclay.
Herbert was far, however, from believing
himself in trouble; nor did he apply to his
uncle for mere advice. But he found himself
suddenly in a new situation which, though full
of delight, perplexed him by its novelty; and
whenever any thing interested him, no matter
what was its nature or importance, to his
uncle
he immediately went to talk of it and
hear his opinion.
This attractive power in Mr. Barclay was
the effect as much of the benevolence and
benign religious confidence, as of the
intelligence
of his mind. His varied experience,
in which constant active endeavor, while daily
accomplishing the practical ends of life, had
corrected and deepened the theoretical
principles
of a meditative and comprehensive
intellect
,was
enriched by a strong inborn
reliance
,
a confiding trust in the inscrutable
power, by whose law the deeds of man are
begun and ended. This inward faith, far
from causing distrust of the efficacy of
human
effort, drew to itself strength from the
observed results of the latter; for the
connexion
between success and well-directed energy
was to him so obvious, as to establish the
conviction
,
that the existence of prosperity is
dependent upon wisdom and exertion,as if
the decree for man's happiness (whatever
may be the other conditions of its fulfilment)
was not issued until he had been seen to labor.
Confidence in the future, therefore, although
there was in him a strong natural tendency to
it, had become so connected with the
inferences
of reason, that it was a stimulant to
activity
,
instead of producing, as it is apt to do,
the contrary effect. He relied first upon
what he could understand and controlhis
personal means; his reliance upon what he
could not, serving both to encourage his
efforts
and to weaken the force of
disappointment
when they were baffled.
Herbert could not anticipate what would
be the nature of his uncle's remarks: he
only felt sure that he should find
satisfaction
in them. This expectation was fully
realized. Indeed, the sympathy of such a
man was a support; and had the words of
his uncle conveyed nothing more definite
than the assurance of this, Herbert would
have been satisfied.
Joyful to both was the meeting between
Mr. Barclay and Mr. Keppel. The former
deluged the latter with questions about
acquaintances
;
for, from congeniality of tastes,
they had many in common, and in every
country
he had visited, Mr. Barclay had wisely
established correspondences, which he still
kept up.
After an hour of pleasant chat the little
party went to dinner.
Why Elizabeth, said Mr. Barclay, you
seem to have presumed that our friend has
returned an epicure.
Your table, Mrs. Barclay, said Mr.
Keppel
,
verifies a remark I once heard from one
of that class, that cooking was a type of
refinement
.
12
One of those remarks, said Mr.
Barclay
,
which having a semblance of truth, are
by many mistaken for true.
Yes, said Mr. Keppel, there is a
connexion
;
and though my epicurean friend did
know that it was collateral, several who
heard him did not. You recollect the
anecdote
of the traveller who, journeying through
a region possessed by savages, rejoiced at the
sight of a gallows, as an assurance that he
had reached a civilized people:the sight of
a truffled turkey would have authorized the
same agreeable inference.
There is however, said Mr. Barclay, a
serious error that has taken root even among
the cultivated, on which the playful remark
of your friend may be taken as satirethe
opinion, that the state of the fine arts is an
index of the degree of general refinement;
an opinion derived from the radical mistake
of believing the sense of the beautiful and
the sense of the moral to be dependent upon
one and the same element of mind.
And to the diffusion of this error, said
Mr. Keppel, I think the great German
Goethe has much contributed.
He himself, however, said Mr. Barclay,
does not entertain it.
No, said Mr. Keppel; and that he is
believed to be authority for it, proceeds from
a misapprehension of him. His works are
so strongly tinctured with his fondness for the
fine arts, and are so much indebted for
excellence
to their spirit, that the means of
successful
execution are mistaken for the end of
composition, and that which was secondary
and subordinate in the mind of the author,
appears to many to be primary in his works.
Do you think, Mr. Keppel, said Alfred,
a short time after, giving another turn to the
conversation, that a young man can receive
much benefit from travel?
A young man, answered Mr. Keppel,
may reap much good. But besides that he
is not so likely to use his means of
improvement
so well as at a maturer age, these means
themselves are greatly less at twenty than at
thirty. To learn by travel, a good deal must
already have been learnt. A stock of
acquirement
,
as well as a certain maturity of
thought, both of which presuppose some
years of manhood,are needed, in order to
gather up the various knowledge that is to be
gathered; a perception, too, searching and
discriminating through exercise and
self-examination
,
and capacious from extensive
study. There must be a solid nucleus of
knowledge, to collect kindred stuff; otherwise,
many rich grains will be touched but not
attracted
,much
will be seen and heard
unheeded
,
because its significance is
unsuspected
.
In answering your question, I suppose a
man eager for improvement, who can choose
his time.
The chief want of a young American
traveller, said Mr. Barclay, is the want of
knowledge of his own country. His
memory
is burdened with a heap of dead fragments
of Greek and Roman doings and writings,
while he is left ignorant of, utterly
uninstructed
in, the nature of the institutions that
surround him in living entireness, acting
daily upon and interwoven with his individual
being; an acquaintance with whose conditions
and principles is to him more important, a
thousand fold, than the most thorough
knowledge
(even could he obtain such) of the
circumstances
and laws of all the nations of
antiquity; which, too, independently of the
practical value of acquaintance with them,
are in themselves, as subjects of abstract
study, far more fruitful of instruction than
ancient institutions, being, unlike the latter,
not approachable only through the imperfect
record of a foreign tongue, but visibly
present
in moving fluctuating operation, directly
cognizable in their details, ramifications,
beginnings
and consequences.
But, uncle, said Herbert, should not
the foundation of a liberal education be laid
with the knowledge of the history and
literature
of the two nations who reached such a
12*
height of power and civilizationwho have
exercised such an influence over the world?
Is not the study of them the best beginning?
But, Herbert, answered Mr. Barclay,
a beginning cannot be made with them;
because
the young mind cannot reach them.
There is the great error. With much toil
you get little fruit. It is like trying to
collect
water in a sieve. The history and
literature
of a people are entirely beyond the
capacity
of a school-boy. He is not
instructed
he
is not educated, by learning by rote,
a meagre sketch of its existence, and the shell
of its language. The principle of adaptation
of means to the end is utterly disregarded: it
is attempted to make a beginning with that
which should be the conclusion; precious
time is thus wasted, and no substantial
beginning
no
foundation is made. What might
be learnt best, and therefore should be learnt,
is neglected for the sake of that which cannot
be learnt. The young mind is translated to
a distant age on the heavy wings of verbal
memory: its whole power is expended in
moving the wings. And you are kept at
this barren labor, while rich materials, suit
able to your capacity, apt to exercise various
powers, and to fix in the mind useful facts
and distinct images, lie around you neglected.
Your attention is tasked to seize that which,
from its remoteness, its dissimilarity to all
that surrounds you, its foreignness to all that
interests you, and from the indirect way
(through books) that it is presented, you
cannot even realize to be a substantial
existence
.
The physically obvious, the teeming
present, inviting you with a living voice that
speaks to the affections as well as to the
curiosity
,
is uncommuned with; and you are
toiled
in pursuit of the vague phantoms of
extinct
existences that answer coldly and
indistinctly
to your laborious appeals. Yourself,
Herbert, what have you learnt of the people
among whom you have lived for the last four
years? What do you know of the laws and
customs of the town whose streets were as
familiar to you as the passages of this house
of the origin and operation of these; of its
political and social institutions and their
principles
of
the differences between them and
those of your native place; of the constitution
and its framers, the history and the men who
moulded it, of the state under whose
protection
you studied? Neither, of the spirit of the
community where you abode, nor even of the
forms of its organization, were you taught any
thing. As a student, you lived out of the
precincts
of real life, pondering over the strange
signs of unintelligible ideas; as if a man who
had to provide food for his dinner, should,
instead
of setting to work with his hands, spend
the morning in speculating on the phantasms
of his last night's dream.
Language being the signs of things, ideas
and feelings, is subordinate to these, is
dependent
upon them, grows out of them.
The manner of its formation points both to
the reason for acquiring it and to the method
of acquisition. As words come into
existence
,
viz.to represent things, &c. so they
should come into the mind of the learner.
They are not knowledge, but the symbols of
knowledge; they should, therefore, follow not
precede it. The reverse of this natural
course is taken, as well in the branches of
instruction in the native language as in those
called
classical. In the latter, not only is
language
taught as if it were the creator of ideas,
instead of being created by them; but this
preposterous end is pursued by means in
which art, far from aiding nature, strives
against her; for, not only is the symbolic,
secondary character of words lost sight of it,
but the mistake thereby committed is doubled
by making words, themselves not recognized
as symbols, the symbols of other words.
The boy of fourteen who translates Horace,
learns that certain Latin words, correspond
to certain English onesand that is all that
he does learn. And what do his lessons of
ancient history teach him? That war is the
condition of humanity; that the first of
warriors
is the greatest of men; that courage and
pride are cardinal virtues; that ambition is
exalted; that power is the proper aim of
statesmen, and conquest of states. To you,
Herbert, ancient history has been only a tale
of warthe story of Jack the giant-killer of
childhood adapted to boyhood. All of it
that was intelligible to you was the
movements
of fleets and armies, victory and
defeat
,
sieges and massacresthe most
general
effects of the commonest passions. Too
few and isolated are the acts of virtue to give
a brighter color to the image painted on your
mindunconsciously perhaps to yourself
that man is a warfaring, treacherous,
revengeful
,
superstitious, tumultuous, animal.
This false systemfalse in its aims, and
false in the mode to attain themis as
artificial
as if human ingenuity in building it up,
had striven to outdo nature by opposing her.
The course which she, ever simple and
uniform
,
prescribes, may be learnt from an
infant
.
In its unconscious development is
legible
the principle which should be the basis of
education. Every object within its reach it
examines earnestly: it is eager to look into
every thing it can put its hands on. To feed
its curiosity, it crawls and walks and climbs.
Its store of learning accumulating, and the
wants of its mind becoming more distinct
and multiplied, the need of signs to indicate,
to label as it were, their classification, calls
into action the innate power to create them;
and language displays her mirror, bright and
perfect, faithful to represent whatever is held
before it, but in itself, nothingcasting back
images, as images, complete, but only
images
all
idea and significance being in that
which is imaged. To continue this process is
the duty of the educator: to lead, and not to
drive, is, as the word indicates, his vocation.
He should encourage the spontaneous
tendency
of the young intellect, engaging it on
that which is immediately around, which is
tangible, which the senses, those natural
instruments
of acquisition, can reach; exciting
it by gratifying its curiosity; delighting it
with palpable results of its power; limiting
his agency to the facilitating and methodising
of its action. His function is, not to use his
own mind to make impressions upon that of
his pupil, but to make the latter develope
itself
.
He is not to pour into it, or rather on
it, the opinions and conclusions of others, but
to keep it in the way of imbibing knowledge at
the original sources thereof,of self-instilling
knowledge from the fresh products of nature.
The space of a few miles square may
embrace
all these,the physical world with its
beauties and powersliving man in all the
conditions and relations of his beinga
complete
theatre for instruction. Brooks and
fields and hills contain the geography of the
globe: the narration of a village's birth and
growth is history: its municipal organization
involves the principles of politics. Here the
learner
earns
knowledge instead of
borrowing
it, and can realize that it is knowledge; for
what he learns is a realitynot a memory; is
incorporated with his mindnot impressed
upon its surface. Such knowledge is a
foundation
;
for it is adapted to a superstructure:
it is a proper beginning; because it invites
and facilitates continuance. From such a
centre the young intellect will expand with
its own growth eagerly to a wider sphere,
calling to its aid, with a distinct appreciation
of their legitimate purpose, books, as
messengers
between the mind and its objects,
telescopes for the mind, to place before it
through the media of mute signs that which
on account of distance it cannot directly
approach
,consulting
them to extend not to
originate information, and understanding
them clearly from already possessing absolute
definite knowledge similar to that which
they display, and obtained at the same source.
Acquirement thus made will feed itself: circle
will be added to circle by the strengthening
impulse of gratified curiosity: the conformity
to nature will make the acquisition more
substantial
and the disposition to acquire more
13
active; until the learner, having penetrated
to the latest results in science, and ascended
in the history of man to the remotest record,
shall have surveyedas far as one mind can
survey,the workings of nature and the
doings
of man.
And yet, what is the grasping power of
intellect, thus beautifully taught to gather
and to hold all outward forms and subtilest
relationswhat is it to the inward
teaching
to
the education of the feelings? This
first want of a human being can by this
process
,
and only by this, be fully satisfied.
Self-knowledge can only be obtained
self-discipline
accomplished, by action; and in
childhood this course of action may and
should be entered on. What is done by
telling
the pupil how he should act? Vain are
many words. Make his own feelings tell
him: make them their own instructors.
Place before him the objectslead him into
the situations, that shall move their deep
fountains to overflowing. Use your power
of control only to multiply opportunities
your art, only to add emphasis to the lessons
of nature. In the family circle and in the
little community around him, all these lessons
are written, and there and thus may be easily
learnt. Selfishness may be made to seem
what it is, and be shunned as a torture. In
the liquid flow of unchecked tenderness, love,
reverence, justice, may have their birth in
joy, not in pain: duty may be practised as
a pleasure, not as a law: self-sacrifice may
be felt as a giving to self, not as a taking
away.
Mr. Barclay having been led into these
remarks by the question of Herbert, was
encouraged
to express himself at such length
by the evident interest with which he was
listened to. When he paused, Mr. Keppel
returned to the subject Alfred had
introduced
.
The traveller, said Mr. Keppel, who is
not furnished with knowledge of the social
usages and political institutions of his own
countrytheir form and spiritwill find
himself, from the want of a standard of
comparison
,
imperfectly qualified to judge of
those of others. Our countrymen sometimes
carry with them prejudices against the
countries
they visit, instead of information on
their own; and sometimes, on the other
hand, the absence of theoretical knowledge
(the only substantial basis for conviction) of
the principles of the republicanism under
whose influence they have lived, exposes
them to be dazzled by the outward
gorgeousness
of foreign aristocracy.
As travelling, observed Alfred, is said
to have the effect of curing prejudice, most
books of travels must be looked upon as
transcripts
from the traveller's mind when in the
crisis of the process of cure; at which
period
,
as in cures of the body, the disease about
to be thrown off, rages with its greatest
violence
.
To depict a civilized people, said Mr.
Keppel, is a high literary and philosophical
achievement; requiring, acquaintance with
all the circumstances of its birth, growth and
present being; insight into the spirit which is
partly the cause and partly the effect of
these; graphic skill, so as to paint
picturesquely
the outward appearance, the
physiognomy
of a nation
Stop,cried Alfred, what you have
said is quite enough to seal up all manuscript
journals.
By no means, said Mr. Keppel. But
to judge of what
is
done, we must have in
our mind a conception of what may bean
ideal standard, with which to compare the
real production; and the more exalted that is,
and consequently, the more difficult of
approach
,
the more tolerant should we be of
failure.
That is a sound rule in morals, but not in
literature, said Mr. Barclay. A bad man
should be pitied and pardoned: a bad work
is out of the sphere of charity. Of taste the
fundamental law is severityof morals,
forgiveness
.
13*
Books of travels, however, are not
as such, amenable to this law; for they are not
(with few exceptions) works of elegant
literature
.
They should be held in the light of
papers called for by a legislative body.
They are documents and reports on manners,
customs, statistics, politics, laid before the
reading world by its orderdrawn up with
various merit, but all answering, according to
their accuracy and fulness, the end of
furnishing
facts, descriptions, and conclusions in
relation
to far distant members of the human
family.
They follow, said Mr. Keppel, in the
footsteps of the great civilizer, Commerce.
And even one which betrays the mean spirit
and shallow intellect of its author, may have
a high value from its store of facts and its
graphic descriptions, the inferences and
impressions
produced by these in the reader,
being the reverse of those recorded by the
industrious little-minded writer.
Those who do not or cannot visit other
countries themselves, said Mr. Barclay,
may, through the works of those who do,
in a measure share the benefits of travel, the
chief of which is the tolerance of spirit
created
,
in men capable of it, by learning how
opposite are the opinions entertained on the
same subjects by different communities. This
moral effect is more to be prized than the
accompanying
enlargement of intellectual vision,
produced by beholding questions from new
points of view and through new modes of
thought.
It is with the traveller as with the
student
,
said Mr. Keppel. Although it is
both possible and profitable to obtain a
considerable
acquaintance with many subjects;
thoroughly to master one, requires long and
assiduous attention to that one. He who
travels for the high object of instruction,
(which embraces, by the by, the highest and
most varied entertainment,) may learn much
of all the countries he shall visit; but to
penetrate
deeply into the spirit of a people,to
understand its peculiar genius,to work into
his mind a clear picture of its individuality,
he must devote years to the study of it, and
pursue the study, not with industry only, but
with a genial zeal. I can speak here from
experience. Having spent many years in
different countries, I went to Italy with the
determination to carry fully into practice a
system I had partially followed every where.
I had no knowledge of its language, and a
superficial one of its history. I established
myself in an unfrequented middle-sized town,
and got admitted as lodger and boarder into
the house of a respectable tradesman, having
a large family. With this family I set out
with identifying myself: I made myself one
of it. From the children I learnt more of
the language than from my grammar and
dictionary. I played and talked with them,
went with them to their schools and read
their books. I entered into the feelings of
the family as if I had been born a member of
it. I shared its amusements and troubles and
occupations. Through it I made my first
acquaintances
,
cultivating intercourse with its
friends and relations. In a short time I learnt
with the language the history of half a dozen
families. I was soon a favorite, from
listening
to every one's story, and taking an
interest
in every one's little pains and pleasures.
In the mean time, I made daily progress in
the study of the literature and history of
Italy. I talked, read, wrote, thought, felt,
nothing but Italian. In this way a year
passed. I then removed to a large city.
Here I associated with a different class. My
acquaintance with the language, customs, and
literature enabled me to take the fullest
advantage
of the facilities for intimate
association
which letters and my American birth
opened to me. I avoided foreigners and
foreign subjects. I moved freely through a
large circle, on the most familiar footing with
many, living the life of a native. I made
excursions
to the country, spending weeks with
my Italian friends at their villas, and taking
note of the mode of life and condition of the
peasantry. At the expiration of another
year I left this city, and set out to visit every
part of Italy, tarrying weeks or months in the
principal towns, and continuing to unite with
constant intercourse with the inhabitants, and
the collecting of every kind of statistical
information
,
the study of poetry and the fine
arts in the spirit of a native. This consumed
two years, making the entire term of my
residence
four, every week of which had been
devoted intently to the study of the Italian
people.
And when you re-ascended the Alps,
said Mr. Barclay, and took your last look at
the Italian soil
It was a look of longing, interrupted Mr.
Keppel. I wished to turn back and spend
another year. I felt as if I had left much
uncompleted.
You liked the Italians then? asked
Herbert
.
I have never known a people, answered
Mr. Keppel, that I did not like.
As, after what has been said, we have
all, no doubt, our ideal standard of what a
book of travels may be, pretty well elevated,
and are therefore prepared to judge of a real
production, suppose we have a specimen
from the manuscript of a traveller, said
Alfred
,
drawing from his pocket a roll of paper.
Come Alfred, said Mr. Keppel, no
treachery.
Of course not, said Alfred: trust to my
discrimination.
Now you are going to bore us, Alfred,
said Mr. Keppel.
Bore you! well, what if I do! Every
one should have his turn.
CHAPTER X.
Alfred
opened the paper and read as
follows:
I had spent several weeksas every one
may spend them at Dresdendelightfully.
It is one of the most charming towns in
Europe
.
Far away from travellers' thoroughfares;
free from the bustle of commerce, and the
tramp and insolence of soldiery; a cultivated,
polished society, over which the
good-hearted
,
old-fashioned royal family diffuses
additional
courtesy; rich collections of the
treasures
of art, and curious hoards from
antiquity
;
the best music; one of the finest
galleries
of paintings in the world; a beautiful
country around;all these form a whole of
singular attractiveness, and makes Dresden a
spot where the traveller, enjoying a luxurious
repose, delights to linger. The summer was
drawing to an end. I had staid a fortnight
beyond the time I had fixed for continuing
my journey south through Bohemia. Having
at last resolutely made up my mind to set off in
a few days, I took leave of my kind Dresden
friends. Talking with one of them of the
resources for amusement of his city`Have
you,' said he, `been at a boar hunt?' `A
boar hunt! No. Are wild boars hunted
near this?' `Yes,' said he. `The king
has a hunt at stated times at this season: if
you would like to see one, to-morrow is one
of his days.' `I would'nt miss it for the
world,' said I. `Then, send a horse to
Moritzburg this afternoon; and ride out in a
carriage to-morrow morning to breakfast: the
hunt begins at eleven o'clock.'`How
fortunate
,'
said I to myself as I proceeded to a
livery-stable to engage a horse, `how
fortunate
that I heard of this! A royal boar hunt
away in the interior of Germany! What a
rare chance for a traveller!' I examined
14
several horses, and having chosen one,
recommended
as strong and sure-footed, I
ordered
him to be sent out that afternoon to be
fresh for me the following day. I provided
myself with a good hunting sword and a pair
of large pistols; and the next morning, after
a two hours drive, I found myself at nine
o'clock at the inn near the palace of
Moritzburg
,
the royal hunting lodge.
After seeing to my horse, I went to
breakfast
.
I was impatient for eleven o'clock to
arrive. The anticipation of danger whetted
my eagerness. I had read accounts of
desperate
fights between boars and their
hunters
,
of narrow escapes, and chivalrous deeds
one of a king, whose life, in peril from a
furious
boar, was saved by a knight at the risk
of his own. Perhaps, said I, something of
the kind may happen to myself! Perhaps I
may beat the king and his suite, and be the
first to strike the animal! I examined my
sword and pistols. But I must not be too
bold; and one of Snyder's finest pictures, a
foaming boar at bay, came into my mind.
In the mean time two other gentlemen
had arrived at the inn, and were taking
breakfast out of doors under a tree. As they
talked loud and seemed to have no objection
to be listened to, from the piazza a few feet
above them could be heard distinctly their
whole conversation, from which I learnt that
they were two young Frenchmen, one of
them attached to the French legation at
Dresden, the other a student of Heidelberg.
Their talk was of themselves and other
Frenchmen, which at any other time might
have interested me; but my mind was now
too much pre-occupied to listen long to any
thing, and I soon walked out to the stable.
I had my horse brought out and saddled and
bridled in order to try him. I saw that the
girths, reins, and stirrup leathers were all
strong and well fastened, and having girded
on my sword and put my pistols in my belt,
I mounted, and following the direction given
me to turn round the corner of a wall that
ran near the inn, a little beyond which was
the starting point, I in a few minutes came
up to the hunting party, already assembled
without the palace court. It consisted of the
old king and his brother Anthony, attended
by half a dozen of the royal household.
They were just about to start, as, falling into
the rear, I joined them. I scanned their
horses, and thought, as I spurred and reined
in my hired steed, that he would prove a
match for any of them. In a few moments
I heard steps behind us, and looking back
saw the two Frenchmen.
We had entered a pine wood and were
proceeding in silence, still keeping to the
road, at a moderate trot, hearing every now
and then from a valley to the left the cry of
the dogs. The two Frenchmen continued
their talk, and so loudly as to attract the
attention
of the royal party, several of whom
looked round. Lest I should be taken for
one of the Frenchmen, I separated myself
from them as much as I could, riding up by
the side of the hindmost of the king's
attendants
,
who seemed to be half groom half
gentleman. He eyed me with a suspecting
air, and his look was several times, I thought,
directed towards my pistols. Wishing to
let him see that I had no connexion with the
Frenchmen, I put on a deaf look as to their
conversation and made a remark to him in
German. I got only a monosyllable in
return
;
and observing that he appeared as
anxious to keep me behind him as I was to
keep the Frenchmen behind me, I fell
back,thinking to myself, how I would dash
ahead of him in the thick of the hunt,
when a rattling volley of French, exchanged
between the two Frenchmen, drove me
forward
again. Presently a yell as of a
hundred
hounds swept up from the valley. The
party quickened its speed. `Ah!' said I to
the German, `the hunt, I suppose, is going to
begin now.'`Begin! its ended, I believe.'
`Ended!'`Yes;' said he, with evident
satisfaction
after listening for a moment, `they
14*
have caught the boar.'`Caught the boar!
who have caught the boar?' `The
huntsmen
.'
The party suddenly turned to the
left through another road in the direction
whence the cries of the dogs came. We
had now got into a gallop and were
approaching
the dogs whose cries however had
become
faint. Suddenly we halted. One of
the party rode forward, and soon returned.
Upon this the king dismounted under the
shade of some tall trees. We all followed
his example. One of the Frenchmen was
describing to the other a boar hunt he had
witnessed in France, and in so loud a tone
that even the old king looked round. I drew
off from them, fearing that I should be
implicated
in their discourtesy. I kept my
eyes fixed in the direction of the dogs.
Presently I described the boarbleeding and
exhausted, dragged along on his back by four
men, one having hold of each of his legs.
They dragged him before the king. One of
the attendants presented to his majesty a
drawn hunting-sword. The king took it,
walked up to the prostrate boar, and pierced
his heart. He drew out the sword and gave
it back to the attendant. He then
remounted
his horse, and the rest of the party did so
after him, and we trotted back by the same
road to Mortizburg. The wood through
which we passed was intersected in every
direction by smooth roads. The wall I had
gone round on starting from the inn was part
of an inclosure in which wild boars, taken in
the forest when young, are confined. When
the king wishes to have a boar hunt, a full
grown animal is caught in the pen; his tusks
are sawed off; and he is then let loose.
Well, said Mr. Barclay, seeing that
Alfred
had finished, there was good sport,
although
not of the kind you expected.
You should head this, said Alfred,--A
royal boar hunt in Germany, in which the
hunter was hunted by two Frenchmen.
These two young men, said Mr. Keppel,
as they appeared on that morning, were,
with the exception of their want of courtesy,
a realization of the vulgar English and
American
notion of a Frenchman; and had I not
lived some time among the French people
and known personally many individuals of it,
I should have exclaimedWhat complete
Frenchmen! whereas they only presented a
caricature of traits superficially distinctive of
their nationtalkativeness, and fondness for
display.
And perhaps, said Mr. Barclay, had
you become acquainted with them, you would
have found that their conduct on that occasion,
though unwittingly on their part, was a
caricature
even of themselves.
About the same time, said Mr. Keppel,
I met with another and more complete
caricature
an
Englishman, whom you might
have supposed to be travelling for a wager or
as a penance. He admired nothing, and
despised
the people: he was always
uncomfortable
and always grumbling. He avoided
contact
with the natives and associated only
with Englishmen. He seemed to feel as if
he had been taken in, when sometime after
we had been acquainted, he discovered that
I was not an Englishman. His countrymen
called him, by way of distinction, John Bull.
The hunt itself was another caricature,
said Alfred.
Not exactly a caricature, said Mr.
Keppel
;
rather a degeneration. The old king,
no longer capable of performing the reality,
went through the form merely of a hunt.
This condition of the royal amusement in
Saxony, said Mr. Barclay, may be taken
as a type of that of the serious vocation of
kings in most countries of Europe, where the
ceremony and outward circumstance of
monarchy
are continued, while much of its power
has passed, and is further passing away;
where, indeed, although there is a nominal
monarch, there is, in strictness, no
monarchy
.
I hav'nt yet done with the traveller's
journal
,
said Alfred. Listen to some verse.
And, re-opening the paper, he resumed
reading
,
pausing at the end of each piece, to make
comments, or to listen to those of Mr. Keppel.
THE ALPS AT SUNSET.
Wherefore and what are ye?unlike all else
Of earth: changeless where every thing is change:
Motionless 'midst the ceaseless flow of life!
Ye bear no earthly stamp; but lift on high
Your speechless, spotless heads, snow-capt, above
All nether influence,cleaving earth-born clouds,
That round your cold sides cling like living arms
Around a corpse, insensate to their touch.
Ye are a mystery,and from the plain
And common of this world, sudden ye rear
Your giant forms, midst the recurring spans
Of time, fit emblems of eternity.
Since first from Zurich's hills, your image loomed,
A heaven-descended vision, on my sight,
Filling my mind with wonderday on day
I've journeyed towards ye. At your mighty base
I've stood in awed silence, pondering
With baffled thought.Around me darkness spreads
Its veil. But ye with beaming summits still
Glow in the sunshine. Telegraphs 'twixt worlds!
For on your tow'ring heads, the westward sun
Casts his last ray for Europeunto me,
A golden herald from my far-off home.
TO GOETHE.
Thou echo musical to the deep voice
Of the Eternal! Through the palling night
Of superstition,making man rejoice
In his free'd powers,thy keen word pierces, bright
With wisdom and with beauty. And the light
Of thy deep poetry on passion gleams
Serene, in triumph o'er its gloom,a sight
Like that at even, when the black storm-cloud seems
Gilded at once and vanquished by the day-god's beams.
The first tone trembling from thy youthful lyre
Awed even thyself; and through the land, a thrill
Shot wildly; eager passionyoung desire
Leapt with new life, confounding human will,
And threat'ning desolating swayuntil
A deeper strain o'er the rapt spirit swept.
Hush'd by the re-awakened sound, stood still
The charmed crowd, and list'ning, mildly wept
Redeeming tears, and love inspired in calmness slept.
Deep hast thou drunk of wo, in the turmoil
Of the world's business mingling; yet apart
From noisy strife,the solitary toil
Of genius thine; weaving in open mart
Thy perdurable web with wondrous art.
Passions reveal themselves upon thy page,
Exposing as they rend the struggling heart:
Butlike olian strings where tempests wage
Thou catchest from them but the music of their rage.
TRANSLATIONS

Note by the Editor
.It is so common for writers to
represent their fictions as realities, that some readers of this
volume may be disposed to doubt the truth of its alleged
origin
.
Although the editor would regret such an opinion, as
an error calculated to weaken the impression of the contents
of the volume, he should not have alluded to it,trusting to
the discernment of the majority of readers,but for the
introduction
of these translations from Faust, between the
latter
of which and the prose version of the same passage by
Mr. Hayward there is so strong a resemblance, that the
reader who should doubt that it had been made at the time it
purports to have been made, would be excusable for doubting
that the resemblance is an accidental coincidence. For the
satisfaction of such, he makes known, that both of these
translations were published in this country in the year 1830,
and may be seen in print as a proof that the resemblance is
purely accidental.
Mr. Hayward, should Mr. Keppel's translation, meet his
eye, would be amused by the coincidence, as the Editor of
this volume was on reading his,extracted in a beautiful
article
in Frazer's Magazine, to which the editor is indebted for
all that he has seen of Mr. H's highly commended version.
In a fine critique on Faust, is Nos. 1 and 2 of the
Knicker-bocker
,
there are translations, whose excellence, combining
fidelity with poetic lightness and spirit, prove the writer
competent
to give a poetic version of the whole of the great
original
.
Although it be, in strictness, true, as the writer states,
that a perfect translation of a great Poem is an impossibility;
the specimens he has given are evidence that, would he
perform
this task, his production would be an acquisition to the
English language, and an honor to American literature.

PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN.
HYMN OF ANGELS.
Raphael.
The sun still sings, forever singing,
In brother spheres his rival song,
And now his path prescribed is bringing
To end, as thunder rolls along.
His aspect Angels aye rejoices,
Though none his law can see or say.
The unrevealed works and voices
Are grand as on creation's day.
Gabriel.
And swift and light the earth is streaming
With gorgeous change so black and bright;
In hues of Paradise now beaming
And now wrapt deep in gloom of night.
The sea 'gainst rushing rivers striving,
On rocklands bursts its foam and wrath;
And rock and sea are onward driving
Eternally in Heaven's path.
Michael.
And storms in contest wild are pouring
From land to sea, from sea to land,

Of deepest action one close band:
There lightning's vivid flash is glaring
Before the coming thunder hoarse:
But these, Oh! Lord, thy orders bearing,
Revere the universe's course.

Though none thy law can see or say;
And thy bright world forever lives,
As bright as on creation's day.

Faust.
Who dare him name?
And who, proclaim,
I believe in him:
Who that may,
Feeling say,
I believe in him not.
The all-infolder,
The all-upholder,
Holds and upholds he not
Thee, me, himself?
Arches not Heaven there above?
Lies not the earth firm here below?
And mount not up eternal stars
Friendly twinkling over us?
Behold I thee not,
And feel'st thou not existence
Pouring through thy heart,
And weaving in eternal mystery
Invisibly visible around thee?
Fill full thy soul with consciousness of being,
And when thou art happy in the fulness,
Call it then what thou wilt
Call it bliss! soul! love! God!
I have no name for it!
Feeling is all in all:
Name is sound and smoke
Curling round Heaven's fire.
Margaret.
That is all right well and good;
About the same as what the parson says,
Only in somewhat different words.
Faust.
All places say it,
All hearts beneath the light of heaven,
Each in its own language;
Why not I in mine?
CHAPTER XI.
The
following day, Herbert was early in
town.
Alfred had asked him to call on him as
soon as he should come in. Deeply
interested
for Herbert, he was anxious to serve him.
But how could he do it? In his view, the
great danger of such a position was
disappointment
.
This was the calamity with
which he saw Herbert threatened.
While his own recent experience thus led
him to figure this contingency as the sole
evil, and to magnify the evil; from the same
source he learnt, how vain is any attempt to
soften it. He had himself felt, that the
misery
of affection warmed into passion, foiled
of its object, and thrown back to wear itself
out by self-consumption, is complete. That
Herbert might suffer this misery, was the
fear which excited so strongly his concern;
and that he might escape it, was the
engrossing
wish of his mind. His doubts respecting
Miss Walsall's worthiness were merged in
sympathy for his young friend's present
feelings
.
Even the worldliness he was disposed
to impute to her, did not now present itself
as an objection; so eager was he to seize on
whatever appeared to give promise of
success
.
He was revolving in his mind the
difficulties
and probabilities of the case;at one
moment venting aloud indignation against
Langley; then, threatening Miss Walsall,
should she not play Herbert fair; then,
anticipating
a favorable issue; then, trying to
imagine consolation in case of failure,when
Herbert arrived.
Well, Herbert, said Alfred abruptly, I
have come to the conclusion, that a woman
who will permit the addresses of such a
15*
scoundrel as Langley is not deserving of
yours.
You have taken one of your short cuts to
a conclusion, said Herbert. You dont
know that Langley is a scoundrel. It is
certain
that Miss Walsall does'nt know it, if he
is. You are not even sure that he is a
lover
.
I am not sure that you are. Or if you
were yesterday, you may not be to-day.
Have you not at times been seized with a
longing for certain things or conditions,for
wealth, or power, or a particular mode of
life,awakened by seeing or reading of their
effects, and been possessed for hours by the
desire, and found after a night's sleep or a
busy day, that it had passed by? Or, have
you not felt anger roused, and, thinking to
yourself`I will not be angry'by a single
effort cast it from you? Love comes into the
mind in the same way, and in the same way
may go out too.
Strange, said Herbert, that I should
have got into the same train of thought just
now as I rode in. I asked myselfam I in
love? and if I amwhat is it?
It is, said Alfred, with an energy which
half imposed upon himself, it is a dream.
Depend on it, my dear fellow, it is. What
is a dream?Sleep and wake at the same
time. The plans or promises of this state of
partial life, are to the walking working man,
what a far off cloud is to the thirsty, or a
glowing star to the chilled. The waking
wings of the mind flutter away from its
sleeping
body, and bear you up as if time were
not, nor space, nor any other obstacle.
This is now your condition. Part of your
faculties is asleep; and that part which is
not, deprived of the balance of the other,
whirls you wildly you know not whither.
That there is a sleep on your mind you may
know from this:what you have heretofore
thought of, you no longer think of; the
common
currents of your feelings are stopt; your
anticipations and schemes are suspended;
even the trees and fields and houses looked
to you as you rode in to-day differently from
what they used to look. Is it not so?
Exactly, said Herbert.
My dear Herbert, you are not a
responsible
being just now,you hav'nt the use of
your mind.
This is a pitiable condition to be in, said
Herbert. The sooner I get out of it the
better.
You are half out of it already, if you are
conscious that you are in it. To feel that a
dream is a dream, is a sign of waking.
You help me so well to self-knowledge,
perhaps you can teach me how to get
knowledge
of others. I should like to know what
are Miss Walsall's waking dreams, or
whether
she has any.
Ah! said Alfred, a woman's dreams are
beyond our ken. The ripples on the surface
of the water we can count; but, how deep
sinks the pebble we have cast, or what it
rests on, is hid from us: beware how you
interpret
the smile that breaks on the soft face
of a woman to your words or looks,it may
be the same, whether these have sunk deeply
or not.
Nay, but if I mean my words and looks
to speak the language of my heart, why shall
I not ascribe to her the same sincerity? Are
women less truthful than men?
They are more truthful, answered
Alfred
.
And often their deceit is the shadow
of men's falsehood; as the fencer must follow
the foil of his adversary in its feints as well
as in its thrusts? A woman acts on the
defensive
,
and is obliged to give you a certain
scope, that she may see whether your attack
is feigned or real. Before she can let you
read her feelings, she must read yours.
You allow then, deception on her part.
Not deception: but, to a certain extent,
passiveness to your advances; and this, for
the purpose not only of discovering what
your designs are, but of learning her own
feelings?
This is placing me in her power, without
any pledge from her.
Nor have you a right to any.
And if she abuse the power
And if you abuse your power over her?
This is in her favor small advantage, to the
difference of your natures and positions.
What are in such a case a man's feelings to a
woman's? I know, Herbert, the hold that
the heart will take, for I have felt the wrench
of its sundering;and if the strength of a
man quails under it, what must it be to the
weakness of a woman? The deep injury I
have suffered would have been immeasurably
deeper had I inflicted it,villain would then
be a mild name for me.But, Herbert, you
too may act on the defensiveagainst
yourself
.
Until you see whether there is an
opening in the heart of her you loveor
rather, would love, for that ought to be the
tensedon't give full play to your feelings.
Make sure of a channel before you let them
loose entirely, else they will with flooding
violence flow back upon you. Indeed, love
on one side only, is a delusionnay, an
impossibility
.
Were we sure from the first
that a woman does not and will not and
cannot
love us, we should not love her; and if
we do love one who does not and will not
love us, it is from the delusion of believing
that she does or will. Well then; start from
this position,she will not love me,and
you are safe. Did you ever try to make a
fire with a single stick of wood?it can't be
done; the single stick will soon go out unless
a second be joined to it: this contains the
whole theory of love. But I see, observing
that Herbert looked at his watch, that you
are impatient to be engaged in the practice.
In which, said Herbert, I shall
endeavor
to be mindful of the precepts of your
theory.
Twelve o'clock found Herbert at Miss
Walsall's
.
He was not disappointed that a
succession
of visitors prevented him from being
alone with her. He did not wish to be thrown
just now entirely upon himself. Alone with
her, he feared too intense a consciousness of
his feelings: the object of his visit would have
shone too distinctly through his manner, in
spite of himself, and he would have been
embarrassed
.
The appearance of being merely
one of several ordinary comers was a mask
to him to himself. He remained a long time,
longer than he would have done without
this countenance. He was encouraged to do
so, too, by Miss Walsall's manner, which,
although
not pointedly affable towards himself,
was, he thought, more engaging than usual;
he fancied that she was pleased that he staid
out several sets of visitors. The charm of
her presence over him grew in strength,
while nothing that she said or did clouded
for a moment the sunshine of his heart.
He came away in that state of buoyant
delight
only felt in youth, and even then, in its
perfectness, only once. He leapt on his horse
to return home. He rode slowly out of town.
He seemed for the first time to feel existence:
the chain that had been secretly weaving in
his bosom to link him to one, he felt, as it
strengthened, to be a fresh bond to life. A
mystery of his being, revealing to him a new
blessedness and a new importance, was at the
same time exhibited and solved. Smiling
sweetly and deeply, love spread its bright
wings to bear him into the future.
He was riding slowly along in this mood,
when, at about half a mile from his uncle's,
his attention was attracted by an old man,
issuing from a small house near the road,
evidently
in a state of alarm and grief. Herbert
held in his horse, and as the old man, who
was feeble and struggling to walk fast,
approached
him, he asked, what was the
matter
:Oh!
my son! my son! exclaimed the
old man. Is he illare you going for a
doctor? said Herbert, turning his horse.
Yes,Go back to the house, said
Herbert: I will go for one. And while
the old man was thanking him through his
16
tears, he galloped off towards the town. He
soon returned with a physician.
He had noticed this house; and, struck
with the neatness about it, and the rich
garden
attached to it, he had, only a few days
previously, as he was returning from town,
stopt, and entered into conversation with a
well-looking young man at work near the
road. He learnt from him, that he was from
Scotland, whence he had come a few years
before; and that he rented this garden, and
supported his family by working it himself.
Herbert went in with the physician. They
found the gardener tossing on a bed. His
father stated, that he had had a severe attack
of fever, from which he had only recovered a
fortnight before; and that he would work in
the sun before he had got his strength; he
was in the garden that morning, when he
was suddenly taken with a faintness and
giddiness
.
While the old man was talking, the
gardener's wife went to the bedside with the
physician, watching silently his countenance
while he questioned and felt the pulse of her
husband. The gardener was in a high fever.
Herbert endeavored to comfort the old man.
He requested the physician to return before
night; and, having promised that he would
himself come back the next morning, he took
his leave.
The scene thus suddenly opened to him,
saddened Herbert. He felt rebuked for his
own happiness. He would at that moment
have consented to forfeit it, to ensure the
recovery
of the gardener. The wife, the
children
,
the father, filled his mind as he rode
home, instead of dreams of Miss Walsall. His
heart yearned for them. How fortunate that
he had been passing just as the old man came
out of the house. He had never before
realized
the weight of affliction. Chords that
had been heretofore struck but by a light and
transient blow, now rang within him their
deep and mournful tones.
His uncle and aunt shared his sympathy
for the poor Scotch family.But he will get
well, Herbert: you will perhaps find him
much better to-morrow, said Mr. Barclay.
The Doctor thought him very ill, said
Herbert. Mrs. Barclay said she would walk
down after dinner to see them.
Herbert called every day at the gardener's.
He continued ill. The physician said his
situation was critical.
Neither did a day pass without his seeing
Miss Walsall. These visits were the sum of
his daily life: all other minutes and hours
were but points of junction from one to
another: recollection of the last and
anticipation
of the next, were the food of his mind
in the intervals between them. There was
no art in his wooing: it was the natural flow
from his heart. He gave himself up to his
feelings, thoughtless of whither they would
lead: and there was as little design in what
he said as in what he felt.
In this way a week passed.
CHAPTER XII.
I am surprised,I am,I did not expect,
Mr. Barclay:you have misunderstood me:
it is impossible that any thing I have said or
done could have induced you to suppose:I
am grieved,but,but,I am engaged.
Engaged!Herbert's voice echoed her
last word. He gazed vacantly for a moment,
as if seeking to comprehend its meaning.
He then rose from beside her, and walked
out of the room.
The sight of the gardener's house at some
distance before him made him sensible of
where he was. He slackened his speed.
Life seemed to have left the scene around
him. The familiar smiling fields looked
desolate
and strange. He approached the house.
Was he awake,did his eyes see? A black
16*
crape was hanging from the latch of the door.
He got down from his horse. He paused.
The stillness weighed upon his senses: he
opened the door and went in. He's gone!
gone! sobbed the old man, throwing himself
on Herbert's bosom and weeping
convulsively
my
sonmy dear boy is gone! The
wife was sitting at the foot of the bed: her face
was buried in it, and she held with one hand
an infant in her lap. One of the children
was on the floor at her feet, while the eldest,
a boy of five years old, was leaning on his
mother weeping with her. Herbert went up
to the bed-side. For the first time he
looked
upon a face resting in death. He gazed
fixedly at the features, as if he would read
the mystery of their stillness. The grief of
the wife became more audible. He turned
from the bed-side, and softly opening the
door, he went out. Tears flowed from his
eyes; and he sat down on the steps of the
house and wept.
Alfred heard in the morning of Miss
Walsall's
engagement to Langley, and
immediately
set off to Mr. Barclay's. He hoped to
arrive
before Herbert should have started to go
to town: he found that he had been gone
some time. When he announced the news:
Engaged to Mr. Langley! exclaimed
Mrs. Barclay.
Is it certain, Alfred? asked Mr. Barclay
eagerly.
Certain, answered Alfred. It's the
talk of the town. I was told of it by a friend
of Langley's who had it from Langley
himself
.
Poor Herbert, said Mrs. Barclay.
Happy Herbert! Most fortunate young
man! I wish him joy, cried Mr. Barclay.
Alfred and Mrs. Barclay expressed
surprise
at Mr. Barclay's satisfaction.
I fear it will be a severe blow to
Herbert
,
said Alfred.
Not even that, said Mr. Barclay. And
what is a blow to a disease for life? The girl
is unworthy of Herbert. This alone is proof
enough. Her heart has preferred Langley,
or she has taken him from want of heart.
Either supposition condemns her, more even
than her trifling with Herbert's feelings.
That I forgive her, and Herbert will too one
of these days. Indeed, as to myself, she has
my best wishes for her prosperity, in return
for what she has contributed to Herbert's.
The sight of her will always awaken in me a
feeling of kindness: I shall say to myself; my
nephew,by one of those acts of wisdom
common, but not peculiar, to youth,put a
large portion of his welfare into that woman's
hands,and she gave it back to him. As to
blows, Alfred,you call it rightly; for a
blow comes from without, and strikes
outwardly
:
it will stun him; but when he
recovers
,
he will be as sound as ever. Fear
not but that he will recover quickly. A
three weeks' acquaintance only! A man
who is not of the stuff to throw off an
impression
made in so short a time, is not of the
stuff to excite strong sympathy,nay, is
unsusceptible
of deep effects. Herbert's
feelings
have been inflamed, not thoroughly
affected
.
As well might you expect a vine to
spread its branches and bear ripe fruit in
a month, as a full growth of the feelings in
this short space. Far different would
Herbert's
situation be, had his affections
intertwined
themselves silently and gradually
and it is only gradually that they can be thus
intertwinedround hers, warmed by the
gentle interchange of familiar attentions,
nourished
by continual intercourse, strengthened
by inward sympathy;but then, the first
tendency
to love would have been checked
instead
of encouraged: the gradual growth of
affection of one like him for one like her
were impossible
While Mr. Barclay was speaking, they
heard a horse's footsteps, and looking out,
saw Herbert riding rapidly up. As he came
near, they were all struck with the
expression
of his countenance, so different from its
usual brightness.Herbert began Mr.
Barclay, surprised and affected by his
appearance
The poor gardener is dead, said
Herbert
.
Dead! exclaimed Mr. Barclay.
Alfred and Mrs. Barclay joined in the
utterance
of sympathy for his family.
Uncle, will you go down with me to the
house, said Herbert.
Certainly; my dear Herbert, answered
Mr. Barclay: and in a few moments they
were on the way.
When they went in, the wife came up to
Herbert, and took his hand: she attempted
to speak, but she could not: she looked her
thanks, and burst into tears.I will take
care of your childrenyou shall want for
nothing, said Herbert. Mr. Barclay
comforted
the father. Herbert sat down on one
side of the room. The eldest child went to
him smiling, and climbed up playfully into
his lap. Herbert sobbed aloud. The child
was alarmed, and getting down, Mother
mother, said he, Mr. Barclay is crying:
he looked towards the bed, and was silent, as
if, for a moment, he understood the scene.
Several of the neighbors came in. Mr.
Barclay
led the wife and her children and the
old man into another room; and having made
arrangements with the neighbors for the
funeral
,
he left the house with Herbert.
This morning I thought
myself
miserable
!
said Herbert.
And yet, said Mr. Barclay, how much
more wretched than it is might be the
condition
of this poor woman. She is a mother:
and for her children and in them, she will yet
be happy. And when the widowed woman
shall be drawn from her grief by the smiles
of her children, the words you just now spoke
to her will shine on the mother's heart,
making
light what but for them would be desolate;
and she will bless you, my son, with the
fervent
blessing of a thankful mother.
END OF THE VOLUME.THE ALPS AT SUNSET.
Wherefore and what are ye?unlike all else
Of earth: changeless where every thing is change:
Motionless 'midst the ceaseless flow of life!
Ye bear no earthly stamp; but lift on high
Your speechless, spotless heads, snow-capt, above
All nether influence,cleaving earth-born clouds,
That round your cold sides cling like living arms
Around a corpse, insensate to their touch.
Ye are a mystery,and from the plain
And common of this world, sudden ye rear
Your giant forms, midst the recurring spans
Of time, fit emblems of eternity.
Since first from Zurich's hills, your image loomed,
A heaven-descended vision, on my sight,
Filling my mind with wonderday on day
I've journeyed towards ye. At your mighty base
I've stood in awed silence, pondering
With baffled thought.Around me darkness spreads
Its veil. But ye with beaming summits still
Glow in the sunshine. Telegraphs 'twixt worlds!
For on your tow'ring heads, the westward sun
Casts his last ray for Europeunto me,
A golden herald from my far-off home.TO GOETHE.
Thou echo musical to the deep voice
Of the Eternal! Through the palling night
Of superstition,making man rejoice
In his free'd powers,thy keen word pierces, bright
With wisdom and with beauty. And the light
Of thy deep poetry on passion gleams
Serene, in triumph o'er its gloom,a sight
Like that at even, when the black storm-cloud seems
Gilded at once and vanquished by the day-god's beams.
The first tone trembling from thy youthful lyre
Awed even thyself; and through the land, a thrill
Shot wildly; eager passionyoung desire
Leapt with new life, confounding human will,
And threat'ning desolating swayuntil
A deeper strain o'er the rapt spirit swept.
Hush'd by the re-awakened sound, stood still
The charmed crowd, and list'ning, mildly wept
Redeeming tears, and love inspired in calmness slept.
Deep hast thou drunk of wo, in the turmoil
Of the world's business mingling; yet apart
From noisy strife,the solitary toil
Of genius thine; weaving in open mart
Thy perdurable web with wondrous art.
Passions reveal themselves upon thy page,
Exposing as they rend the struggling heart:
Butlike olian strings where tempests wage
Thou catchest from them but the music of their rage.TRANSLATIONS

Note by the Editor
.It is so common for writers to
represent their fictions as realities, that some readers of this
volume may be disposed to doubt the truth of its alleged
origin
.
Although the editor would regret such an opinion, as
an error calculated to weaken the impression of the contents
of the volume, he should not have alluded to it,trusting to
the discernment of the majority of readers,but for the
introduction
of these translations from Faust, between the
latter
of which and the prose version of the same passage by
Mr. Hayward there is so strong a resemblance, that the
reader who should doubt that it had been made at the time it
purports to have been made, would be excusable for doubting
that the resemblance is an accidental coincidence. For the
satisfaction of such, he makes known, that both of these
translations were published in this country in the year 1830,
and may be seen in print as a proof that the resemblance is
purely accidental.
Mr. Hayward, should Mr. Keppel's translation, meet his
eye, would be amused by the coincidence, as the Editor of
this volume was on reading his,extracted in a beautiful
article
in Frazer's Magazine, to which the editor is indebted for
all that he has seen of Mr. H's highly commended version.
