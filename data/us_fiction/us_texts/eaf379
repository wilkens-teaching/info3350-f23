REASONS FOR JOHN SMITH TO CHANGE HIS NAME.
New York
,
January
12, 1839.
Dear sir
There is a subject on which any
one
            might be eloquent, emphatick, energetick, but
I fear there is no pen adequate to
            convey to you
the importance of it. It is a curious subject; no
less a one
            than to ask a man to change his name!
Smith, you will certainly have to change your
name.
We thought at first of approaching you with a
round robin, as the conspirators
            did in the olden
time. We intended to set forth the many and the
cogent
            reasons why such a change should be made,
and as our signatures would follow one another in
a circle, the ringleader of so daring a proposition
would never be known. On
            the whole, however,
it was thought most advisable to write a letter, and
I
            volunteered to incur the risk of your taking
offenceas if any one of
            the name of Smith could
take offence at a proposal of this kind.
To say your name is Smith is enoughit speaks
volumes in itself. To be
            sure, it is a word of only
one syllable, but look at the letters which compose
it! They are, individually, the most contemptible
in the alphabet, and
            always serve to usher in
whatever
is pitiful or worthless, and there is no other
method of conveying an
            impression of a Small
MeanInsignificantTrashyHumbug, but by
appropriating the five initialsand these five initials
what are they
            when combinedwhy SMITH!
No honest man would change his name for that
of Smith, even were it Sheepshanks,
            Pot, Kettle,
Vinegar or Bellows, of which names there are
many on record. He
            would not change any of
these, objectionable as he thinks them, for one that
would place him behind a screen all his life. No,
he would not take the shadowy
            name of Smith,
even under the expectation of inheriting an estate.
Not for the reason that no one of that name could,
by any possibility, have an estate to bequeath, but
that he would lose his
            personal identity.
I doubt whether there are at this day more than
two men who could find any
            reasons strong enough
to be induced to take the name of Smith. These
two
              men
par nobile fratrum
our two recent,
glorious
defaultersthey might find it convenient to
preserve their
            incognito; and in what way could
they effect it so completely as to veil
            themselves in
this misty, gauzy apology of a man?
Do you think the police-officers would ever run
after a man by the name of Smith?
            They never
pursue the crime, but the criminal, and this
criminal
must have a nameis Smith a name?
ergo
,
our
            two noble defaulters would remain unwhipped
of justice even on the idle
            supposition that the
government
issued warrants against them. Why
don't they prove an
            alibi? said Weller, senior.
Smith
is an alibi in itself. Let rogues, therefore,
hide
            behind this magnetick board, for they will be
invisible to us; but, like Dr.
            Elliotson's two
hospital
girls in London, this board will be no
obstruction
to them.
Smith, therefore, is a nonentity, a dead letter
a dead letter, did I say! Why, he that owns it is
dead and buried. The very playwrights make fun
of it. In a recent farce one
            of the characters is
made to say, Smith, Smith, I am sure I have
heard that name before. Did you ever see a man
that did not blush deep
            crimson when you asked
his name, if it be that of Smith? Talk of the man
who
            lost his shadow, Schleimel, I think he was
called; what was that compared to the
            loss of the
substance, for he that loses his personal identity is
lost
            indeed.
It has often been said that if you are in
Broadway
and call out Mr. Smith, every tenth man will
turn; but if you call out John
            Smith, every other
man will look round.
No Smith ever gets rich or gets fame; if by
chance one of the name does a clever
            thing, or
writes a clever book, who can identify it?
what
Smith reaps the benefit of it? The honour is
diluted
to a hompathick dose, and
the
Smith who
ought to swallow the whole allopathick credit, gets
only the millionth part of a
            drop of his share.
Do you think that the Messrs. Carvill or Harper
would be so indiscreet, or so
            insane, as to buy the
2
copyright of a work from any man by the ubiquious
name of Smith?
Men never think of calling their dogs Smith.
Csar, Pompey, Carlo,
            Napoleon, Victoria, these
are the names, but not Smith; a sensible dog
would
            not answer to it. Young puppies might;
those that are in their blind state must
            put up with
it till their eyes were open, but no longer. If John
Smith were
            to engrave his name on a dog's collar,
tens of thousands would whistle for him,
            for the
name is Legion; nay, if
Legion
were engraved
on the collar of a stray dog, the most
            natural thing
in the world would be to carry him to a
Mr. John
Smith
.
Every man that wants to travel incog., either to
escape civilities or the
            penitentiary, calls himself
Smith; not Smith by itself, but Captain Smith.
No woman faints on board a steamboat, or at the
theatre, or in Niblo's Garden, but
            there is a Dr.
Smith, nay, several Drs. Smith, ready to officiate.
Good, honest, ingenious old Tom Smith, the
famous blacksmith that once flourished
            in
Courtlandt-street
,
told me that he often
            wondered and
wondered, his name being Smith, that he should
have been so
            foolish as to double his cognomen
that he should tack it to head and
            tailSmith, the
blacksmith! However, said the poor, vexed man,
I
            thank heaven that I am not rich, for I might then
have sent my son to college, and
            as sure as fate he
would come out a doctor, which would be worse
than all.
A Dominie Smith might, perchance, die a
bishop
,
but no
            thanks to his name; he climbs up the
ladder by holding fast to the skirts of some
            patron
saint. He is not Bishop Smith, but the bishop of
St. Matthew, St.
            Mark, St. Luke, or St. John, or
the bishop of Georgia or Maine.
No one likes to relate an adventure of which a man
by the name of Smith has been
            the hero, (can such
a name belong to a hero?) he dreads the
            thousand
and one questions that will pour out upon him
Which Smith? Where does he live? Has he
a middle name? What is his
            first name? Many
a good joke, many an excellent anecdote has been
smothered, because the name of
Smith
was in it.
Paradise could not hold all that have come and
gone by the title of Smith. St.
            Peter would be
afraid of a disturbance; he would not open the gates
to let
            any more in, I am convinced.
The proverb says, that if all lost things went to
the moon, how full of good advice it would be.
And I say that if all doctors went to Old Nick,
how full of
Smiths
his furnace would be.
It is said that the legislature will not grant
permission
to a man to change his name unless it be
one that has an improper meaning,
            such a one that
he could not offer to a lady without a blush; or in
case of
            the expectation of an inheritance. Read
this letter to them, and they will see at
            once that
Smith is no name at all when inheritance is in
question, and that
            a man does not only blush when
offering it to a lady, but even to that august body
the legislature themselves. Depend upon it, there
will be no debate: you
            will receive your new name
by return of mail.
I remain yours, in the hope of this change; but
alas! I shall know you no longer
            if you are still to
be John Smith, for crowds upon crowds are flitting
before me, and all unreal. You will merge in the
misty mass, and become a
            hallucination. Adieu.

JOHN SMITH'S LETTER'S.
LETTER I.
Wherein are set forth divers weighty reasons why John Smith
should
not
change his name.
Smithville, Down east
,
February
, 1839
Dear Gineral Morris
I never was more struck
up
            in my life than I was night afore last, about
eight o'clock in the evening, when
            Cousin Debby
come running into our house all of a giggle and
most out of
            breath; and says she, Cousin John,
here's news for you; they've got you
            into the
New-York
Mirror, as true as my name is Debby Smith.
Says I, what nonsense
            are you arter now, Debby?
for she's always poking fun at somebody or other,
although she don't mean nothin' by it, for she's as
clever as the day is long. Says she, I mean
            jest
what I say, John; they've got you in the
New-York
Mirror, as large as life. And she held up
the
            paperDebby takes your paper, and has took
it, I believe, going on a
            dozen years, for she's very
fond of larning and has kept school in our village,
off and on, about fifteen yearsand she held up the
paper, and,
            says she, John, here's most a column
and a half, all about you, every
            word of it. And
they are making something of a fuss about you in
New-York
            too, and say you must change your
name. At that my dander begun to
            start a little,
and, says I, Debby, are you in arnest, or what do
you mean?
            For I knew I hadn't killed nobody,
nor robb'd, nor stole a sheep; and, says I, I
            should
like to see the feller that would dare to tell me, to
my face, that I
            ought to change my name. My
name is what I've valley'd myself on more than
anything else in the world, and there never was a
name yet that I'd change it for,
            unless it was
George Washington. But come, says I, Debby,
set down and read
            us your long yarnDebby is a
first rate reader, and she loves to read
            afore folks
as well as she loves to eat. So we made room for
her in the
            ring. We had a rousin' fire, bein' it was
a pretty cold night, so we could set back and make
room for all; for there was something of a ring of
us; our own family isn't
            smallthere's myself and
wife, and eleven children, and my mother, and
aunt Jane, and my nephew William Smith that
works for me; and besides that,
            there was a
number
of the neighbours in, setting round to drink a mug
of cider with us and eat
            a few of my fine winter
apples. Debby hauled a chair up to the table, and
snuffed the candle, and drawed it close to her, so
as to hold it between her and
            the paper; and then
the reading seemed to bother her a little, for your
paper, Gineral, is rather fine print, and she had to
hold it off nearly at arms
            length and hold the
candle
close to it, because she said her eyes were weak.
Aunt Ruthshe's my uncle John Smith's wife,
a very sensible woman, and
            one of the kindest
neighbours there is in our villageshe sot on
'tother side of the table with her knittin' work in
her hands, and looking over
            the top of her specs
across the table at cousin Debby. She see what
was the
            matter, and pulled off her glasses, and
reached
them across the table and told Debby she better
try her specs, and she
            thought she would read easier.
Debby coloured as red as fire, and said she never
used spectacles; and besides, if I
            did, says she, it
isn't likely I could use yourn; they must
            be a great
deal too old for me. At that my uncle John Smith
he's a blacksmith by trade, and lives close by
on 'tother side of the
            roadhe was setting in one
corner, digging his teeth into the mellow
            side of a
great sweet applehe rolled up his eyes at Debby,
and
            haw haw'd right out. Says he, well done
Debby, you've hit it now
            exactly; my wife is jest
five years older than you, and them specs suited
her
ten years ago.
Debby kind of choked a little, and her face
turned redder than ever: I don't know
            but she
would have bit a board nail off, if she'd only
had one in her mouth.
            Uncle John has a
teazing
kind of a way with him, and when he sees any
body nettled, he loves to help
            'em along a
little
.
So, says he,
            Debby, I want a new vice
in my shop; what will you take for your teeth?
            I
think they'd hold a pretty good grip. Debby
couldn't stand it
            no longershe threw down the
paper, and drawed her head back as if she'd
            had a
curb bit in her mouth. Says she, Uncle John,
you are the
            biggest plague that ever I see, and if
you was worth a minding, I would be mad
            with
you. I see the only way was for us to try
            to
make a kind of a joke of the matter all round, till
Debby got cooled down
            a little; for she was in too
much of a flusteration to read now;
            So, says I,
come John, fill up the mug with cider
            agin and
hand it roundthis was to my
son
John;
            he is my
oldest son, and will be seventeen years old if he
lives to see the
            fifth day of next May; a smart boy
as you will see one in a thousand, and folks
            say he
takes after me very muchsays I, Come,
            John,
hand round the cider, beginning with the oldest,
clear down to the
            youngest, and give it to cousin
Debby last. At that Debby begun to
            laugh, and
says she, Cousin John, you are almost as big a
pester
            as uncle John himself, and one isn't worth
a minding any more than 'tother
            is.
After we took a drink of cider round, and each
one took another apple, Debby got
            so calmed down
that we got her hold of the paper again. She
wouldn't touch
            the specs though, but after she got
the candle fixed right, she made out to read
            it very
well. And sure enough there was a whole column
all about my changing
            my name. I never felt so
queer before in my life. But when she read the
line
            at the top, Reasons for John Smith to change
his namesays I,
            Debby, now before you
begin
,
how do you know
            that means me? There's
more John Smiths in the world besides me.
Why, because, says she, every body knows it
means
            you. Here you've been selectman, of
Smithville, this seven years; have been
            surveyor
of the roads, and on the school committee, and
town agent, and been
            twice representative to the
Legislater, and had a squire's commission five
years; and it's pretty likely the piece could mean
any body else but you. Suppose
            Gineral
Washington
was alive to this day, and such a piece should
be published, saying George
            Washington ought to
change his name? Wouldn't every body know it
meant
            Gineral Washington?
Well, says I, Debby, to be honest about
it, I
            think it pretty likely it
does
mean me. But
let us hear
            what they have to say in New-York
about my changing my name. So, as I said
afore, she read it through. Sometimes, when
she was reading it, I couldn't hardly
            keep my
dander down, and sometimes I couldn't hardly
help laughing to see
            how ignorant the man that
writ it must be of the world. When she got
along
            down to the place that says the five
letters
that spell
Smith
, stand for a
            SmallMean
InsignificantTrashyHumbug,
            my son John
started up as if he'd been shothe looked as red
as a
            rooster, and says he, Father, I wouldn't
stand that no how; I'd go
            right to New-York and
put it into that chap what writ that are piece.
Says I, John, you haven't seen enough of the
world yet to know
            which is the best road to mill.
You are young and inexperienced, and you must
try to keep your temper down and take things
more moderate. I shall write to
            Gineral Morris
and get him to see to it, and then, if the feller
that's
            dared to call me a humbug, don't take it back,
he must look outthat's
            all. Read on,
Debby
,
says I.
By and by she come to where it said, no
honest man would change his
            name for that of
Smith. Stop, says I,
            let us reason about
that a little. Honest men don't have
occasion
to change their names. 'Tis rogues and
knaves that change their names; and
            when they
do, they try to pick for the likeliest and most
respectable
name they can find, and therefore they
take the name of Smith. And this is
            one reason
that Smiths are so plenty. There isn't so many
real Smiths in the world as folks think for. There
are a great many counterfeits about. But that
don't hurt the real Smiths,
            nor make 'em any less
respectable. If you had a true silver dollar in your
pocket, would you valley it any the less because
your neighbour had a pewter one?
            If you ever
come acrost a person by the name of Smith that
don't bear a good
            character, you may depend upon
it, Smith isn't his real namehe has
            changed some
other for it. And I've been told, on the very best
authority,
            that all the Smiths that have been hung
for any crime, have always confessed
            privately
under
the gallows, just before they were swung off,
that their true name wasn't
            Smith, but Johnson,
or Davis, or some such name.
And now, my dear Gineral Morris, this makes
me think of another thing. There was
            my
cousin Major Jack Downinghe's a cousin to
me on the mother's
            side, and as good a feller as
ever livedupright and honest, and no
            slouch
at writing. Well, he went down to Portland,
in the State of Maine,
            seven or eight years
ago, and went to writin' letters in the Portland
Courier, and then he went off to Washington,
and staid along with Gineral Jackson
            some time,
3
and writ letters to the Portland Courier; and when
he got his name up pretty
            well, folks begun to
counterfeit his letters and his name too, like smoke,
all over the country. Most all the counterfeits
were so badly done, that any body
            could tell 'em
the moment they put 'em along side the true ones.
There was
            one chap in your city that carried on a
great stroke of counterfeitin' these
            letters, and
signing Major Jack Downing's name to 'em for a
year or two, and
            I don't know but morelet's see,
what was his name? Seems to me it begun
            with
a D. Well, he used to put in some kind of
mettle into 'em
            that made 'em ring, and had a nack
of glossing of 'em over, so that he made 'em go
quite current in your city and round there. But
you put 'em along side of
            cousin Jack's, and you'd
see in a minute they warn't the true silver. But
he
            didn't care for that, as long as he could make
'em go, and make the folks round
            New-York think
he was the real Major Jack Downing. And that's
the way of the
            world, Gineral; every body wants
to go by a good and respectable name, and you
may depend upon it that is the true secret why
there are so many
            Smiths.
After Debby had got through reading the piece,
we all sot as much as ten minutes, and didn't
say nothin'. At last, says I, uncle John, what
do you think of it?
            Think of it? Says he
why, I think it's
            the foolishest mess of
flummery
that ever I seed put into a newspaper. In
my opinion, it doesn't contain one
            single good
reason why you should change your name. And
there is no reason
            in the world why you should,
but a thousand why you should not.
            And
what are they, uncle John? says I.
            Why,
says he, it is a very old and respectable
            name;
it has been in our family a great while; it is
therefore
an honour to be called by the name of John
Smith. And in the next place, it
            is the most
popular name in the country; so that if popularity
is worth any
            thing, that proves John Smith to be
the best name in the country. And in the next
place, it is a very short name; you don't waste
but little time in speaking
            it, nor but little paper in
writing it. And in the next place, there's no sich
thing as clipping it off or nicknaming of it; if any
body speaks your name
            at all, they can't make
nothin' short of John Smith of it.
Well, aunt Ruth, and cousin Debby, and
mother, and aunt Jane, and my wife, and my
son John, all expressed the same opinion as
uncle John, only some of 'em a great deal more
arnest. Mother, she sighed, and
            said she thought
the man must be an a'ful wretch to want to
make her son
            change his name, when it was
the best name there was in the whole Bible,
especially
the John, and she had picked it out when
she give it to me, out of that
            chapter where the
angel give it to the child of Zachariah and
Elizabeth
.
My wife, she almost cried, and said she
should go crazy, if she thought I should ever change
my name, and leave all
            her children poor orphans.
So among all the other reasons, Gineral, aginst
my changing my name, you see what a disturbance
it would make in my family. And,
            on the whole,
I've made up my mind decidedly;
I shan't do
            it
.
I don't know how it is in New-York, but down
east, and in
            Smithville, and all round here, not
only Smith, but
John
Smith, is considered the
best and most honourable name there is going.
It
            has come down to me in a straight line, clear
from Capt. John Smith that first
            settled in old
Virginny
.
And a braver man than he was
            never lived.
I've got his coat of arms now, that's come down
long with his name, three Turks' heads made up
in a picter, hanging up in our fore room.
I said his name come down to me in a straight
line; but it wasn't exactly a
            straight line, for it
crooked out of the line a little in one place, and
that was in the case of my father, whose name was
James. I'll tell you how it
            happened. When my
grandfather, whose name was John, carried my
father to
            meetin' to be christened, it happened that
the same day his cousin John Smith
            carried two of
his
children to be christened. And when the
minister
was ready, my grandfather, bein' a very perlite
man, beckoned to his cousin
            John to carry his
children
up first. So he carried 'em up, and good old
parson John Smith, who preached
            in grandfather's
parish then, whispered to him as he handed up the
first
            child, and asked him its name. His name is
John, said my grandfather's cousin. So
            the
parson
christened him John. The second child was
then handed up, and the parson
            whispered again and
asked its name. His name is John, said my
grandfather's
cousin. The good old parson shook his
head, and whispered again, and told
            him he had
christened the other one John. My grandfather's
cousin shook his
            head too, and told the parson to
3*
never mind, but christen him John; for, says
he
            if I had a hundred children, I would call them
all John. So
            finding there was no turning him,
the parson christened the second child John.
            Then
my grandfather went up with his child; and I've
heard my grandmother
            say that his face was red
as a blaze all the way goin' up to the pulpit. Well,
the minister whispered to him and asked him what
the child's name was.
            Grandfather choked a little,
and, says he, I was a going to call him
            John, but
I think we have had Johns enough for one day;
you may christen him
            James. Now, Gineral, I
don't know but I've tired you with my long yarn.
I didn't think of writin' sich a long letter when I
begun. But when I get a
            goin' I'm a little like
the steam car on the rail-road; I'm apt to run till
I get to the end of the track, or till the fire is out.
I've only one thing more
            to say, and that is, bein'
you've had my name figurin' in your paper, I
believe
I shall subscribe for it. And I guess I ain't
the only Smith that will. As I
            am always called
'Squire Smith round in these parts, I want you to
direct it
            to John Smith, Esquire, Smithville, Down
East, and it will come to me straight as
            a hair.
And if you want to hear any thing more about our
folks, jest say so in your paper, and I'll scratch
down a line or two, once in a while, and send it to
you. So I remain your
            friend and constant reader,
JOHN SMITH, ESQUIRE.
LETTER II.
Wherein Miss Debby Smith, with a becoming juvenile spirit, giveth
a
            slight touch on the other side of the question.
Smithville, Down East
,
latter part of February
, 1839.
Much respected sir
Excuse my not datin' my
letter corect, which is a great trial to mefor
if I pride myself on
              any thing, 'tis in being
corect;
and I've had the name of it ever since I've
kept
              school in Smithvillebut our almanack isn't
to home; it's up to uncle
              John Smith's, not uncle
John the blacksmith, but uncle John Smith on my
mother's side. My mother was a Smithnot that
I'd have you think my
              father married his relations
the people in Smithville are more corect
              and think
more of the Bible than thatbut there's two stocks
of
              Smiths here that go so far back that folks can't
tell where they begun. Though grandmother
always made it out and stood to it, that they all
come from one in the first
              place, and said it made
my father and mother fifth cousins. The old lady
is very curis about these things, and she has it all
marked out in the shape of
              a great large tree, and
keeps it hung up in the fore room, and when there
is any thing said about it, or any dispute takes
place about the Smiths bein'
              related, she takes it
down and goes over the whole, clear from the root
to
              the top branch; and always brings it out that my
father and mother was fifth
              cousins. Whenever
she has these reckonings, grandfather is as uneasy
as a
              fish out of water, for he thinks if it should go as
grandmother fixes it,
              'twould make him and
grandmother
fourth
cousins; and he's
so
corect, that
              if he
should really think it was true, although he's now
eighty-five years
              old, I do believe he'd try to get
divorced. So grandfather is always against
grandmother
in her reckonings, and whenever she sets
down to go over the tree, for she
              always hauls the
table up and sets down to it, so as to make no
mistake,
              then grandfather he'll put on his spectacles
and take his staff and hobble along
              and stand and
look over grandmother's shoulder, and foller her
along up among the branches. But generally in
about a quarter of an hour he gets so tangled up,
and the branches run together
              and crossways, and
get mixed up so that he breaks off short, and says,
Poh, mother, there's no head nor tail to it. We
all come from Adam,
              accordin' as 'tis in the Bible,
and that's all the relation there is about
              it.
So grandfather 'll hobble back to his chair again,
and set and wink and look as
              uneasy as can be, all
the time till grandmother gets through. And
grandmother
will always stick to it till she gets clear out
to the end of every
              branch, and winds up by saying,
Well, father, it must be so; if they
              ain't fifth
cousins, I don't know what makes fifth cousins.
But, dear me, where am I running to? I haven't
said a word about what I was
              going to when I
begun
.
But when I happened to mention
              that my
mother was a Smith, I was afraid you might take a
notion the
              Smithville folks wasn't quite so corect
in their idees about matrimony as they
              ought to be.
So I felt it my duty to stop and explain how it was.
To go back to uncle John Smith agin, on my
mother's side, he borrid our
              almanack day before
yesterday, and hasn't brought it home yet. He's
a
              clear trial about borrying. Now grandfather is
always prompt about every thing. He always
has
              a new almanack in the house the first day of
January, and has had every year
              since I can
remember
,
though to be sure that isn't
              a great
many years, but I mean he always does. But
uncle John, on my
              mother's side, never gets an
almanack for the first six months of the year; so
              he
has to come clear down to our house, about three
quarters of a mile,
              once or twice a week, to borry
ourn, though the shoes he wears out and the time
he spends is worth more than forty almanacks.
He's always saying every
              week he's going to get
one, but I never knew him to get one yet till about
haying time; and once I knew him to lose a ton of
hay that got wet in a shower,
              while, instead of
getting
it into the barn, he come down to our house to
get the almanack, to see
              when the moon was to
change. But there, I'm running before my story
again.
The reason, then, that I couldn't give the corect
date to my letter is, that my
              uncle John Smith, on
my mother's side, has got our almanack, and it's
too
              fur for me to go up after it to-night; and, the
truth is, I
must
write to-nightI'm in sich a takin'
I can't help it, for
              I've jest got your last Mirror,
and been reading over cousin John's letter, and it's
put me all in a flutter. It's too bad, I declare,
sich
              insinuations as he's made against me in that
letter is too bad to think of. I
              didn't think that
cousin John, who I've always treated as a brother,
though he's a good deal
older
than me, would a
done so,
              and then to have it printed in your paper
and read by every body in New-York,
              and every
where else; dear me, I feel as if I should fly; what
will
the New-York folks think of me? I was
intending
to come to New-York next summer and see
the place, and I've been saving up
              something out
of my school money a year past, to pay my
expenses
.
I think I've lived long enough in the world
to go about
              a little now and see some other place
besides Smithville; not that I've lived
              very
long
in
the world neither. But I mean, now I've got
              to
be a grown-up young woman. Dear me, it's
so
lonesome
here in Smithville sometimes, for the want
of more young society.
              I've heard there is a good
deal of young society in New-York, and I've been
almost in fidgets for a year past to go there. But
that pesky letter of
              cousin John's has throwed all
the fat in the fire. If I should go there now,
              every
body that I should see would be thinking of the
insinuations
in cousin John's letter, and I should not
feel
              as if I could hold my head up as I walked the
streets.
Now, dear Gineral Morris, are you a single man
or a married man? for I'm afraid
              I may be
speaking
rather too familiar. I do hope you'll get this
letter before your next
              paper comes out, and have
them insinuations about me corect; for they are
not corect now, and cousin John knows it. He
must a done it jest to teaze me.
              It's true, I
have
kept school in Smithville fifteen yearsI don't
deny
              thatbut then I begun when I was quite
young; very young indeed. You
              know sometimes
smart girls, that get their edication very young,
begin to
              keep school when they are mere children.
And when I begun to keep school I was
so
young,
that I felt every day as if I wanted to go
              out and play
with the childrenn every time they was dismissed.
It's true, too, that I've took your paper most as
long as cousin John said, for
              it's ten years the first
of last January, since I begun, and I've sent the
money for it every year regular. But what if I
have took your paper ten
              yearswhat does that
argu? Why, that I was a good skoller, and took
to reading very young. And if cousin John was as
4
fond of lurning as I be, he would a took it years
ago too, and not waited
              till now, and took it jest
because there was a piece put in about him.
Cousin John knows I've got more lurning than he,
and knows that's how I come to
              take the Mirror
so young; for when we used to go to school
together
,
I always kept ahead of him in all the
branches, though he was so much older than me:
yes, a
great
                deal
older than me.
And then cousin John is no writeryou see by
his letter he's no
              grammarian. Now, I
teach
grammar
in my school, and have composition besides.
And I shouldn't care a pin if
              you should publish this
whole letter of mine, jest to let cousin John know
that there's other folks in the world that can write
besides him.
What he said about aunt Ruth's specs, he must
a done jest to teaze me, and for
              nothing else in the
world. My eyes are as good as hisn any day
that is, I can see as well; it's true I read and
study so much, they are rather
              weak, and
sometimes
plague me about reading. Don't you think,
Gineral, your types is a little
              too small? not that I
speak on my own account, for my eyes ain't weak
all the time, but on account of elderly people, who
find it rather trying to read sich small print.
And as to what cousin John said uncle John, the
blacksmith, said about buying
              my teeth for a vice,
as though I was mad and gritting my teeth, the
idee
              he conveyed by that was
not
corect, and it's a
plaguy
              shame he should say it. I'll tell you jest
how 'twas. I was setting by the
              table, and was
nipping an apple seed between my teeth, and
uncle
John, the blacksmith, he sot looking at me, and
he see my full round set
              of large white teeth, for I
show my teeth considerable, and though I say it
myself, I've got as good a set of teeth as there is
in the city of
              New-Yorkwell, uncle John sot
looking at me, seeing me nip the apple
              seed, and
he's a coarse kind of man, you know; so, says he,
jest for a
              joke
Debby, I want a new vice in my shop; what
will you take for your
              teeth? I think they'd hold a
pretty good grip.
As for my being mad, it was no sich thing, for I
have the name of being one of
              the best tempered
people in Smithville. And I trust I shall always
keep
              it. But if there is any thing in the world
that would sour my temper, it would
              be the want
of young society; and that's one thing makes me
so anxious to go to some sich place as New-York,
where I can have a plenty
              of young society. And
if them insinuations in cousin John's letter don't
operate too much against me, I mean to come to
New-York yet. I should like to
              keep a school there;
and, perhaps, you'll be so kind, bein' I've took your
paper so long, and always paid you regular and in
advance for it, perhaps you'll
              be so kind as to look
round a little for me, and see if there's a good
chance for me to keep school any where there. I
should like to have it in some
              part of the city where
there is a good deal of young society, you know.
I don't know but I ought to say a word or two
about the Smith name, that's made
              sich a fuss in
your paper lately. I think cousin John is very set
in his
              way. To be sure, the Smith name round
here, is a name that every body likes, and
              although
there is a great many of 'em, yet we never get
mixed up so, but
              that every body can tell who is
who and which is which. But, perhaps, the name
may not be liked so well in New-York; and, I
think, it is about as well
              always to try to do what
will suit the folks best where we live. So it isn't
so much to be wondered at, that cousin John should
be a little riled at anybody's wanting him to change
his name, and that he should make up his mind,
as he says, so
              decidedly, that
he shan't do it
.
But cousin John is
very set
in his way. Thank
fortune
I ain't so set in mine. And as I said afore,
if the name isn't liked so
              well in New-York, and I
was living in New-York, I shouldn't be so very set
about not changing it.
Now, my dear Gineral Morris, (you see I can't
help speaking in that
              gentle kind of waygood
tempered folks are always apt to speak
              so,) now,
this is the first letter I ever writ to an editor, and
it makes me feel rather delicate, though I've no
doubt it is as good a one as
              cousin John's; and if
you should print this, I want to ask one favour
about it. I want you to send a copy of your paper
that has it in it, to young
              Mr. Ichabod Smith, the
school-master, at Smithville, upper Post-office. But
not let him know that I said any thing about it, for
that's a secret
              between you and me. He's a very
respectable young man indeed, and he's been at
our house a good deal; but sometimes I think he
is more like my uncle John
              Smith on my mother's
side, than he is like my grandfather. I want he
should see this letter, and when he finds I'm resolute
4*
about going to New-York, I guess
he'll-he'll
there
Gineral, I declare, my idea
confused, I
              don't know what I was going.
So I remain your sincere friend and
scriberno, I mean your young
              reader,
MISS DEBBY
LETTER III.
Containing, among other matters and things, a chapter on animal
magnetism.
Smithville, Down East, in the state of
                  Maine
,
March
1
st
,
                  1839.
Dear Gineral Morris
I got your very
perlite
letter last night. The same post brought it
that brought your last Mirror,
              that had cousin
Debby's letter in it. About Cousin Debby's
letter
,
where she hinges so hard against me in it,
I shouldn't
              troubled you to take any notice on't, for
I don't think she's worth a minding,
              hadn't it been
for the very perlite request in your letter to me,
that I
              should write some more letters to you and
let you print 'em in your Mirror. But
              I feel it
my duty now to clear up my character to you a
little
in respect of truth and verassity, because some
parts of Debby's letter
              seems to go almost
head-foremost
right against some parts of mine. So to
set this matter to rights in short meter, Gineral, I
must say that cousin Debby, although she's in the
main a very good sort of
              a gal, yet when any thing
nettles her considerable, she will stretch the
stockin'
a little, that's a fact. And that isn't her worst
failin'; for a few years
              past she's been a good deal
given to breaking up matches. So that the young
folks, when they take a notion to have any
courting
goin' on, jest about as lives die as to have
Debby
get hold on't, for they know she won't rest day
or night till she's turned
              the whole business
topsy-turvy
,
and poured all
              the fat in the fire.
But that's neither here nor there. I ain't agoin'
to talk to you about Debby,
              nor no sich nonsense,
but come right down to matters of more
importance
,
tha tyou spoke about in your letter.
I was a good deal struck up to find that you and
the New-York folks didn't know
              any more about
Smithville; and couldn't even tell what state it
was in. It
              is a very noted place, and has been a
good many years. It turned out more
              soldiers to
go down to Portland in the last war, than any town
of its size
              in the state. And didn't you never hear
how high politix run in our town when
              Adams and
Crawford was up for president, and I and Ichabod
Smith was run for the legislater, and how we voted
till ten o'clock at night, tie and tie, and no choice,
and then had a
              knock down and put the candles
out, and adjourned till next day? You must have
heard about it, and had it in the papers there tu,
for it was all the talk
              about here for months. Not
know any thing about Smithville! Seems to me
'tain't possible. Why, we've been represented in
the legislater ever since our
              state was separated
from old Massachusetts. I've been there two
winters
myself; and though I say it myself, I suppose
I held as good a rank as
              most any of 'em there,
unless it was a few that was called leading
members
.
I was appointed on the committee on
accounts
and on the committee on dividing towns,
and the speaker used to most
              always stop and speak
to me as he was going out of the house after we
was
              adjourned. I can't see how it is possible that
New-York shouldn't know a good
              deal about
Smithville
;
more especially as it
              jines Downingville, and
Downingville is known by every body in New-York
and all over the country. And moreover,
Downingville
is only a child, as it were, of Smithville;
for they was both one town at
              first, and Smithville
was the mother town, and Downingville was set
off from Smithville in the year 1811, the year
before
the last war broke out. I don't mean this new
war that's going on down
              here to the north-eastern
boundary, but what's always been called the
last
war.
It seems strange that Downingville should be
known more than
              Smithvillethat the child should
get ahead of the
              motherthough I know it seems
to be a kind of a law of nater, that
              children should
out-do their parents, and make more noise in the
world
              than their parents ever did. I'm
considerable
ahead of what my father ever was; he never
had a squire's commission, nor
              never was a
representative
to the legislater. And then here's our
state of Maineyou know
              she's the daughter of
old Massachusettswell, she's getting up in the
world faster than ever her mother did, and is
running
ahead of her like smoke. She's got so big
she won't take an insult from
              the biggest nation
in the world. If Great Britain plagues her a
little
about cutting down some of her pine logs, by
the gracious! she don't stop
              to ask no questions,
but flies right in her face, tooth and nail, and tells
Grent Britain if she wants to fight, she's the boy
for her. Now old
              Massachusetts never would a
dared to done that in the world. She would a
looked over her shoulder and hollered to Uncle
Sam to come and help her, as hard
              as she could
scream, before she would struck a blow. But
somehow or other
              I believe children do have more
spunk than their parents after all. Their dander
seems to start quicker. There's my son John
you let any body
              insult him or me or any of the
family, and he's into 'em in a minute. A regiment
wouldn't stop him. I should like to give you an
account of some of his
              tantrums if I had time,
although
he isn't seventeen years old till the fifth of
next May.
I was glad to find you and the New-York folks
thought so much of my 'tother
              letter, and wants
me to write again; though I feel a little kind
of
              streaked about writin' letters for you to print
in your Mirror, along side of
              them are fine
pieces that you have from men of great larning.
Though I
              don't know that I have any need to
be ashamed of my larning, for all Debby
hinges
as though it wasn't as good as hern. She
may know more than I do about
              needle-work
and grammar and these fine arts; but when you
come down to the
              solid branches, sich as
ciphering
,
suing folks, duing town business, and working
politix, she's no more than a baby to me; I can
wind her round my finger in
              every one of 'em in
two minutes.
You say you want me to tell you all about
Smithville
and Smithville folks, where our ancestors
come from, and how long they've
              lived here, and
how we've got along and built our town up and
made sich a
              smart place of it, and give you my
views about matters and things in general.
              Now
that, according to my notion, Gineral, is pretty
considerable of a
              broad question, especially the
matters and things in general; for I find there
              is a
good many things in this world; and I guess there's
some that your
              New-Yorkers hain't thought of yet.
But I'm kind of puzzled to know whereabouts I
better begin. I don't know whether I better
begin
at the root of the matter and trace it all out in
rotation, as grandmother
              does when she goes over
the Smith tree, that Debby told you about in her
letter, or whether I better begin at the top and so
work down along, as they say
              the freemasons do
when they build their chimblies. Sometimes I've
a good
              mind to begin right in amongst the matters
5
and things in general, which, I take it, means
animal magnetism
. But I see Mr. John Neal is
writing for
              you on that subject, and has got along
as far as the Notch of the
              White Hills and the
gloves. But I don't know as
              there would be any
harm in having two hands at the same job, and as
there's matters and things enough in the world to
last two of us considerable
              time, I don't know but
I might as well, and I believe I will, write a little
about animal magnetism tu. I think I should like
to write along side of
              John Neal, he goes ahead so
much like a steam-engine.
ANIMAL MAGNETISM.
Smithfield Burying-ground.The
              Apparition.
It was a bright moonshiny night, as you will see
one in a
              hundred'twas in the latter part of
September
,
and the weather was jest about warm
enough to be comfortable. `Twas a
              Sunday night
I had my go-to-meeting clothes on, and had been
over to see Sally Newbegin, she that's now my
dear wife, at this very blessed
              moment. I didn't
marry a Smith, but a Newbegin. I took a fancy to
that name, because grandmother used to say, when
one got married, they
              always had to begin the world
anew;
and I thought if I could marry a Newbegin,
my world
              would be already pretty well begun. And
Sally was a fine gal, though I say it.
              And I had
to get up pretty early, and set up pretty late
tu, to get her,
              for most all the young fellers in
Smithville, and near about a score from
Downingville
was after her one while. But Sally never
staid with any of 'em but me, for
              she always took
a liking to me ever since we went to school
together
.
Well, this night we sot talking in the fore room,
till the old brass clock
              struck twelve, and then I
told Sally that I
must
go. She
              said she didn't
believe
but what the clock was too fast. So I sot
down again a minute, or I didn't
              think it was a bit
more than ten minutes, when the plaguy old clock
struck
              one. I sprung and catched my hat, and
bid Sally good night, and started for home
              as fast
as I could go. I had to go nearly two miles; and
about half a mile
              before I got home, I had to go by
the burying-ground, that was close by the
              road.
'Twas a very lonesome sort of a place. There
was thick woods on 'tother side of the road, and
'twas nearly half a mile to any house. When I
got along in sight of the
              burying-ground, I naturally
begun to think over who was buried there; and
about one that was always supposed to be
murdered
for
a good many folks have always thought
there's been one murder committed in Smithville;
and then I thought how aunt
              Jane was once
frightened
most out of her senses coming along by the
burying-ground, between
              daylight and dark, and
always stood to it she see an apparition. I always
used to laugh at her about it, and have made her
as mad as fire a hundred times,
              whenever she sot
out to tell the story; for I didn't believe nothin'
about
              ghosts and apparitions; and aunt Jane would
always turn around to me when she
              got through
the story, and say, well there, John, I hope if you
live you'll see an apparition.
I felt as if I'd done wrong in hurting aunt Jane's
feelings so many times, for
              she's a clever creatur
as ever lived; and then the thought come over me,
as I got along within about twenty rods of the
corner of the burying-ground,
              what if aunt Jane's
wish should come true? My flesh kind
              of crawled
a little, but I wouldn't mind itapparitions wasn't
nothin' but old women's whimsI clinched
              my
hands a little tighter and walked along, and begun
to whistle a little;
              not very loud, but a low tune,
jest to show that I wasn't afraid. The dark
shadows of the woods begun to fall across the
road, for the moon had got down
              some ways
behind
the trees. It seemed as if the place was
dreadful still; and I felt my
              flesh crawl again. I
stopped whistlingthe place was so still I
              couldn't
whistlewhen all at once I heard a most
terrible
groan
. My hair ris right up, and I thought my
heart would
              a jumped out of my mouth. It wasn't
so loud a groan as some, but a low,
              distressed,
awful sound, sich as I never heard before in my
life. I
              stopped short, for I couldn't move a step
one way nor 'tother; my feet seemed to
              grow to
the ground. The groan come agin, and the
shudders
run over me like a streak of lightning. The
sound seemed to be a little
              ways ahead of me, and
as I looked along, about a half dozen rods, I see a
white thing, about as long as a coffin, laying across
the road. I couldn't feel
              no skeerder than I was
before
,
but the sweat begun to
              pour off of me like rain.
The groan come agin, and I was sure it come from
the white thing across the road. It looked about
5*
as large as a man, and white enough to be a
winding
sheet wrapped round it.
I begun to feel it was possible there might be
sich things as apparitions, and
              I felt like death to
think I had hurt aunt Jane's feelings so much about
it. It didn't move any, but laid still and groaned.
I thought at first I would
              speak to it, but I couldn't
muster courage enough. What could I do? My
courage never failed before. I went back a few
steps, keeping my face all the
              time towards the
apparition; for I couldn't help feeling convinced now
that '
twas
an apparition. I could go home another
way, by
              going round nearly three miles, but what
good would that do? apparitions could
              go faster than
I could. I went back a few steps farther, without
taking my
              eyes off of it; it didn't follow me, but
laid still in the same place. I begun
              to feel my
courage come a littleI never was a coward; but
I
              didn't know what to doI couldn't go forward,
and I wouldn't go back.
              I picked up a little round
stone, about as large as a hen's egg, and threw it
towards the apparitionnot hard, but rolled it
along the ground,
              jest far enough to hit it easy. In
a moment it sprung up on eend and fell down
again twice; and groaned louder than ever. But I
minded, both times it fell, it didn't fall towards me,
but from me. After
              a minute or two, I thought I'd
try that motion again. I threw another stone.
The apparition sprung up on its feet jest as it did
before, and fell down
              again, with its head from me.
At this my courage begun to come a little more,
and I ventured to go along a few steps nearer, once
in a while throwing a
              stone. The apparition
seemed
to be afraid of me, and every time I threw a stone
it would seem to jump
              about its length from me.
At last it got along to a place where the moonshine
come down between the trees on to it, and I got
up to within about two
              rods of it, and all at once
my heart was as light as a feather. It was
nothing
but uncle John Smith's old hog, that had got
his forefeet both up through
              his yoke, and was
half choked to death, and could only spring up on
his
              hind feet and groan. A fiddle-stick take your
apparitions, said I, and I went
              whistling half the
way home, determined to hecter aunt Jane about
her
              apparitions harder than ever.
In respect of your invitation, Gineral, for me to
come to New-York and make a
              visit, there's nothing
would suit me better, for I've always wanted to see
that are place, and if I can bring my business about
so as to make it
              convenient, I think I shall do it. I
remain your sincere friend,
JOHN SMITH, ESQUIRE.
LETTER IV.
The war in our disputed territory.The drafting at Smithville.
Smithville, Down East, in the state of
                    Maine
,

March
8, 1839.
Dear Gineral Morris
I was going to give you
a
              kind of a history of our folks and our town
going away back to the
              beginning, and so coming
down along in course, but we have been in sich a
flustration here about the war for a week past,
that I can't think of any thing
              else, nor write about
any thing else, till the flurry is over. My son John
has gone down to the boundary war, along with
the rest of 'em, and we feel bad
              enough about it, I
can tell you. He's too young to go, I know; he's
a mere
              stripling of a boy yet, as I told you in my
'tother letter; he won't be
              seventeen years old till
the fifth day of next May, if he should live to see
it. But the poor boy may never live to see that
day now, for he's taken
              his life in his hands, and
gone to fight for his country like a man and a hero,
live or die. It was a tryin' time to us, Gineral; it
was a tryin'
              timebut I may as well tell you the
story, and then you'll know.
After we heard the British had taken our Land
Agent, and carried him off to
              New-Brumzick, we
begun to look out for a squall. It was about dark
when
              the post brought the papers that had the
account
of it; so, arter supper, we all went into
grandfather's to talk the matter
              over; for
grandfather
knows more about sich matters than any
body else in
              Smithville,he was out three years
in the revolution, and was in the
              battle of
Lexington
before he listed, and had the fore-finger of his
right hand shot off in
              the battle of Bunker-hill,
jest as he was pulling trigger, and aiming at a
British officer that was hurrying up the hill, and
driving his soldiers up like
              a fury. But grandfather
always says he didn't lose his shot by it; for when
he found that finger was gone, and wouldn't pull,
he tried the next
              finger, and the old gun went
without
losing his aim, and the British officer fell; and
he always believed 'twas his shot brought him
down. Though grandfather is eighty-five years
old now, and is so lame that he
              can't walk about
much, yet his mind holds out remarkably, and he
can talk
              about these things as smart as ever he
could. His house stands right aside of
              mine, only
far enough apart for a long shed between 'em, and
he used to
              live in the same house with me, or
rather I lived in the same house with him,
              till I
had so many children, and my family got so large,
'twas rather
              worrisome to the old gentleman, and
we was rather scant of room, so I built
              another
house, and moved into it, and got cousin Debby to
live with the
              old folks, and take care of them.
So, as I said afore, arter supper we took the
papers and went into
              grandfather's, and I sot
down and read it all over to him, how a parcel of
the British come over into our disputed territory,
and went to cutting down our
              timber like smoke,
so as to steal it, and carry it off in the spring, when
the rivers open, away down to New-Brumzick; and
how our new governor, Mr.
              Fairfield, as soon as
he heard about it, sent Mr. McIntire, the land
agent, and a hundred and fifty men to put a stop
to that stealin' business, and
              ketch the fellers if he
could, and bring 'em off; and how Mr. McIntire
took his men, and marched away off down there
into the woods, ever so fur, into
              our disputed
territory
,
and got all ready, and was
              jest a going to
ketch the fellers, and bring 'em off up to Augusta,
when
              the thieving chaps turned about, and
ketched
him
, and put
              him on a sled, and hauled him off
away down to Frederickton, in New-Brumzick,
and put him in jail.
When I got along so fur, grandfather couldn't
hold still no longerhe
              struck his staff down on
the floor, jest as if it had been a training-gun, and
says he:
John, there 'll be trouble; you may depend
upon 't there 'll be
              trouble. If our people will
stand that, they ain't made of sich kind of stuff as
the old revolution folks was made of, nor nothing
like it. In them days,
              if the British had a took one
of our men, and hauled him off to Frederickton,
and put him in jail, every man in the old Bay
State, and every boy, tu,
              that was big enough to
carry a gun, would a shouldered it, and marched
to
              New-Brumzick, and Fredericton jail would a
been stripped down in no time, and
              Mr. McIntire
brought home agin.
6
Says I, father, you mistakeI most always
call
              the old gentleman father, since my father died,
and he's always been a sort of
              father to all of us,
and to every body in Smithville, from oldest to
youngestsays I, father, you mistake; your
revolution
folks couldn't a brought Mr. McIntire
home again, for he was not there in
              them days
it's Mr. McIntire that's in jail now.
Yes, they would, said the old gentleman,
rising out of
              his chair, and striking his staff down
on the floor harder than he did afore;
              they'd a
gone after Mr. McIntire, or any other man living,
that
              had American blood in his veins, and they'd a
brought him back, if they'd had to
              fit their way
through forty New-Brumzicks for him. Ain't the
people waking
              up about it no where? ain't they
going down to give them New-Brumzicks a
thrashing
?
I looked at my son John, and I see his face was
all of a blaze; and he looked
              as if he was jest a
going to burst out.
Says I, John, my boy, what's the matter?
His face grew redder, and the tears come into
his eyes, and he struck his fists
              together, hard
enough to crack a walnut.
By king, says he, father, I wish I was old
enough to train; I want to go down there and
help to give them are British what
              they deserve.
By the memory of George Washington! said
my grandfather,
              I wish I was young enough to
train; I should like to shoulder my gun
              agin, and
go and teach them New-Brumzickers better
manners
.
But what are they duing at Augusta? Ain't
there no stir
              about it yet?
Says I, we'll read on and see. So I looked
over the
              papers a little more, and found the
governor
had ordered ten thousand of the militia to be
drafted to go down and keep
              the British out of our
disputed territory, and prevent their stealing our
pine timber.
That looks something like it, said my
grandfather
;
that's a little like the spunk of old
seventy-six. The British 'll have to let our
disputed
territory alone now, or else they 'll have to
come to the scratch for it.
              I wish I was twenty
years younger, I'd go down as a volunteer.
I wish I was only two years older, said my
son John,
              then I should stan' a chance to be
drafted; and if I wasn't drafted,
              I'd go whether or
no.
At that my wife and grandmother both fetched
a heavy sigh. Grandmother said,
              she thought
father
had been through wars enough in his day to
rest in his old age, and let
              sich things alone. My
wife, she wiped her eyes, for they was full of tears,
and begged John not to talk so, for he was too
young ever to think of sich
              things. And then she
turned to grandfather, and asked him if he really
thought there was going to be any war.
Yes, said grandfather, jest as true as the
sun
              will rise to-morrow, there 'll be a war, and
that pretty soon, tu, unless the
              New-Brumzickers
back out, and give up Mr. McIntire, and let the
timber on
              our disputed territory alone. The orders
will be up here, to draft the militia
              within two
days, and I shouldn't be surprised if they should
be called out
              before to-morrow morning.
At that my wife and the gals had a pretty
considerable
of a crying spell.
After we'd talked the matter all over, we went
home and went to bed; but we
              didn't any of us
rest very well. My wife she sighed herself to
sleep arter
              a while; and I heard my son John,
arter he got to sleep, muttering about guns
              and
the British, and declaring he would go. I had jest
got into a drowse about midnight, when I heard a
heavy knock at the door. I sprung out of bed, and
went and looked out of
              the window, and asked
who was there.
Sargent Johnson, was the reply. We've
got to
              stan' a draft to-night. The governor's
orders got here about an hour ago. We're
sending
round to warn our company to meet up here to
Mr. Wilson's tavern, at two
              o'clock this morning;
it's near about one now, and the captain wants
Squire Smith to come over and help see about
making the draft. He wants to get
              through with
it as soon as he can, so them that's drafted may be
getting
              ready, for they've got to set out to Bangor
at eight o'clock this
              morning.
I told him I would come right over; and so I lit a
candle and dressed myself as
              quick as I could, and
come out into the kitchen to put on my boots, and
who should I find there but my son John, all
dressed
,
and his cap on, ready for a start. He had
heard what had been said, and it
              put the fidgets
right into him.
Says he, father, I want to go over and see
'em draft. I
              told him he better be abed and
asleep, by half. But he said he couldn't sleep;
6*
and I found the boy was so arnest to go, that I
finally told him he might.
We hadn't more than got dressed, before we
heard the drum beat, over to Mr.
              Wilson's tavern;
so we started off and went over. When we got
there, they
              had a fire in the large hall, and the
company was most all there. The captain
              had got
a bowl and some black beans and white beans all
ready, and he
              wanted me to draw for them, so
they might all feel satisfied there was no
              partiality.
There was one sargent to be drafted, and we drew
him first;
              and it fell to Sargent Johnson. He
stood it like a man; I didn't see as he
              trembled or
turned pale a bit. He looked a little redder, if
any thing,
              and kind of bit his lip as he took his gun
and marched into the middle of the
              floor, and
turned
round and looked at the company, and says he;
I'm ready to go and fight for our country to
the last drop of my
              blood, but what we'll make the
British back out of our disputed territory, and
              stop
their thieving.
The company gave three cheers for Sargent
Johnson, and then we went to drafting
              the privates.
There was sixty in the company, and ten was to
be drafted.
              So they took fifty white beans and ten
black ones, and put 'em into the bowl, and held it
              up,
so nobody couldn't look into it, and I was to draw
'em out as the
              orderly sargent called out the names.
So when we got ready to begin, the sargent
              sung
out
William Jones
I put my hand into the bowl and drawed, and
sung out
White bean.
Peter Livermore, cried the sargent.
Peter Livermore started, as if he'd had a shock
from an electrical machine; his
              legs shook a little,
and he looked in the face as if he felt rather bad.
I
              put my hand in and drawed, and sung out
White bean.
Peter looked better in a minute. He's a great
tall six-foot chap, and looks as
              if he could almost
whip a regiment of common fellers himself; and,
although he's something of a brag, it's generally
thought, when you come right
              up to the pinch of
the game, he's a little cowardly. Peter stretched
his
              head back, and straddled his legs a little wider,
and looked round on the
              company, and says he
I swow, I thought I should a been drafted,
and I almost wish I had.
              It would a been fun
alive to a gone down there, and had a brush long
with them are New-Brumzickers. My old
fowling-piece
would a made day-light shine through fifty of
'em in half an hour's
              fighting. I swow I'm
disappinted
I
was
              in hopes I should been drafted.
The company knew Peter too well to mind
much what he said; they only laughed a
              little,
and the sargent went on, and called out
John Smith, the third.
I drawed to it, and says I,
White bean.
The sargent called out again,
John Smith, the seventh.
That was the oldest son of uncle John Smith,
the blacksmith; a smart boy, about
              twenty-three
years old. Somehow, as soon as I heard his name,
I kind of
              felt as if he was going to be drafted; and
I put in my hand and drawed, and sure
              enough, I
sung out
Black bean.
John shouldered his gun in a minute, and
marched
out into the middle of the floor, and took his
stand beside Sargent
              Johnson. He looked so
resolute
,
and marched so
              quick, that the company
at once give three cheers for John Smith, the
seventh.
John Sanborn, cried the sargent.
White bean, said I.
Ichabod Downing, said the sargent.
I drawed, and answered the same as before,
White bean.
`Jeremiah Cole, called out the sargent.
Black bean, said I; black bean for Jerry.
After waiting a minute, the captain called out,
where's Jerry Cole?
              Isn't Jerry here?
Yes, setting down behind here on a bench,
answered a half
              a dozen at once.
Come, Jerry, come forward, said the captain,
let us see your spunk.
By-and-by, Jerry come creeping out from
behind
the company, and tried to get across the floor;
but his face was as white
              as a cloth, and he shook
and trembled so he couldn't scarcely walk. He
let
              his gun fall on the floor, and sot down in a
chair that stood by the side of the
              room, and
boohoo'd
out a crying like a baby. Well done,
said the
              captain, there's spunk for you.
What's the
              matter, Jerry? can't you go?
Boo-hoo, said Jerry, I ain't well at
              allI'm
very sick, captain; I don't think I could go any
way in the world.
Well, well, said the captain, leave your gun,
and you may run home as fast as you can go and
see your mother, and we'll get
              somebody else to go
in your room.
At that Jerry darted out of the door, and pulled
foot for home, like a streak
              of lightning.
Where's Peter Livermore, said the captain;
he
              may take Jerry's place, bein' he was
disappinted
at not bein' drafted. And he called
Peter, and told him to take
              Jerry's gun, and stand
up in the floor with the drafts. Peter coloured as
red as you ever see, and begun to sweat. At last,
says he,
Captain, I don't see how I can go any way in
the world, my family's
              out of wood and meal, and
a good many other things, and I couldn't leave
home.
Oh, says the captain, we'll take care of
your
              family while you are gone, Peter. Come,
take the gun; don't stop to
              parley.
But, captain, said Peter, the sweat
beginning
to roll off of his face, if I'd been drafted,
captain, I'd a
              gone with the greatest pleasure in
the world, and shouldn't wanted no better fun.
But somehow or other, it seems to me like
presumption
,
to go to throwing myself into danger,
when it wasn't my lot to go. I
              shouldn't like to
go, captain, without I was drafted.
Well, well, said the captain, you needn't
go;
              we want no cowards to go. But who is there
here, among the spectators, or among
              the men
whose names have been called, that isn't afraid to
take Jerry's
              gun and fill Jerry's place. If there's
any one here that's willing to go, let
              him come
forward.
At that my son John sprung like a young tiger,
and seized Jerry's gun, and
              jumped into the
middle
of the floor and stood up by the side of
Sargent
Johnson, and shouldered his gun with so
much eagerness, and looked so
              fierce and
determined
,
although nothing but a
              striplin' of a boy,
that the whole company burst out in three
tremendous
cheers for John Smith, the tenththat's
what he's numbered; we
              go accordin' to numbers
in the village. The captain asked me if I was
willing he should go. I never was so tried in my
life. For my own part, bein'
              the boy was so brave
and wanted to go so much, I should a said yes.
But then I knew it would almost kill his mother.
So, what to do I didn't know. But I found the
boy had got his mind so
              fixed upon going, that if
he didn't go it would about kill him. So, on the
whole, I told the captain yes, he might put his name
down.
Then we went on with the drafting again and
got all through without any more
              trouble, and got
ready to go home about three o'clock. The
captain
told them that was drafted, that they must all
be ready to march at eight
              o'clock in the morning,
and they must be in front of the tavern at that hour,
and start together for Bangor. My son John and
I then went home, and made
              up a fire and routed
the folks all out, and told 'em John was listed, and
got to start at eight o'clock, to fight for our
disputed
territory. Sich an outcry as there was for
about half an hour, I guess you
              never heard.
My wife couldn't a cried harder if John had been
shot dead
              there before her feet, though she didn't
make much noise about it; for she
              always cries to
herself. The older gals, they cried considerable
louder;
              and some of the younger children, that
didn't hardly understand what the trouble
              was
about, sot in and screamed as loud as they could
bawl.
At last, says I, there's no use in this noise
and fuss; the boy's
              got to go, and he's got to be
off at eight o'clock tu, and the sooner we set
ourselves
to work to get him ready, the better. That
seemed to wake 'em up a little.
              My wife went to
work and picked up his clothes, and she and the
gals sot
              down and mended his shirts and stockins,
and fried up a parcel of dough-nuts for
              him to put
in his knapsack, and got him all fixed up and
breakfast ready
              about six o'clock. We hadn't
waked up old grandfather in the night, bein' he's
so old; but in the morning we let him know about
it, and he wanted my son
              John to come in and see
him before he went; so we went into the old
gentleman's
room.
Now John, my boy, said the old gentleman,
I
              feel proud to hear sich a good report of you.
You'd a made a good soldier in the
              days of the
revolution
.
'Twas such boys as you
              that drove the
British from Lexington, and mowed 'em down on
Bunker-hill.
              You'll feel a little queer at first
when you see the enemy coming up to you with
their guns pinted right at you; and, brave as you
7
are, you'll feel a little streaked. But you musn't
mind it; as soon as
              they've fired once, you won't
feel any more of it, and won't keer no more about
'em than you would about a flock of sheep. But
don't be in a hurry to
              firemind thatdon't be in
a hurry to firethey
              told us at Bunker-hill not to
fire till the enemy got up so near we could see
              the
whites of their eyes. And 'twas a good rule; for
by that means we let
              'em get up so near, that
when we did fire, we mowed 'em down like a field
of clover, I can tell you. Be a good boy, John,
and don't quit our disputed
              territory as long as
there is any dispute about it.
By this time we see 'em begin togather in the
road up by the tavern, and I told
              John it was time
to be off; so he took his gun, and his knapsack,
which
              was pretty well stuffed, for each of the
children
had put in a dough-nut or an apple, or a piece
of cake, after their mother
              had crammed in as
much as she thought he could carry, and then he
marched
              away like a soldier up to the tavern.
When they started, they had to come down
              again
by our house and go up over a rise of land 'tother
way about half a
              mile, before they got out of sight.
So we all stood out in a row along by the
              side of
the road to see 'em as they went by. Grandfather
got out as fur as the door-step and stood leaning
on his staff, and
              grandmother stood behind him
with her specs on, looking over his shoulder; and
the rest of us, with the children and cousin Debby
and all, went clear out
              to the side of the road.
Pretty soon they come along by, Sargent Johnson
at the head, and the rest marching two and two.
When they got along against us,
              little Ned run up
and tucked another great apple into John's pocket,
and
              my wife called out to him, Now do pray be
careful, Johnny, and not
              get shot.
Then grandfather raised his trembling voice,
and says he,
Now, John, my boy, remember and don't be in
a hurry to
              fire.
And the children called out all together,
good-by
,
John, goodby John, each repeating it over
three or four times. John looked round and
nodded
once, when his mother called out to him, but
the rest of the time he held
              his head up straight
and marched like a soldier. We stood and
watched
'em till they got clear to the top of the hill and
was jest a going out of
              sight, when all to once
John stepped out one side, where we could see
him, and let his old gun blaze away into the air,
and in a minute more they were out of sight.
Ah, said old grandfather, that sounds like
Bunker-hill; that boy'll do the business for them
New-Brumzickers, if they don't
              let our disputed
territory alone.
We feel dreadful lonesome, Gineral, since John
went away. It seems as if our
              family is most all
gone, now he's gone. If you should hear any
thing about
              his fighting down there to our disputed
territory, I wish you would put it in
              your paper,
for we shall feel dreadful anxious till we hear
from him. So I
              remain your friend and
subscriber
,
JOHN SMITH, ESQUIRE.

LETTER V.
Wherein young John Smith, the tenth, describeth the march of the
Smithville detachment, down to our Disputed Territory
also, relateth the
            occurrence of a remarkable mistake, that came
near putting to flight two
            belligerent forces.
Smithville, Down East in the State of
                  Maine
,
March
19, 1839.
Dear Gineral
I've jest got a letter from our
son John, and as I s'pose you hain't heard
from him yet, since he went down to
              fight
disputed territory, I thought I would set do
write a line or two,
              and send you John's letter, all
but a few lines he writ to his marm and the
children
,
which don't seem to have much to do about
the war.
I 'spose you might get the news from our
disputed
territory by the way of Smithville, as
quick as any way, for the post from
              Houlton, on
the upper road, comes right by here. I got John's
letter last night, jest before bed-time. I went in
and read it over to old
              grandfather; and the old
gentleman was so rejoiced about it, he couldn't
hardly sleep a wink all night. But I musn't write
any more myself; if I do, I
              shan't have room to
give you all of John's letter; and I want to give it
to you in his own words; for, accordin' to my
notion
,
although he's but a striplin' of a boy yet, and
won't be seventeen years old
              till the fifth day of
next May, yet, accordin' to my notion, he writes
remarkable well. He went to school to cousin
Debby in his younger days, and
              since that, I've
teached him the solid branches myself. But John
writes as
              follers:
Our Disputed Territory, pretty near the
                  Line
,
March the
13
th
, 1839.
Dear Father
I take my pen in hand to let you
know that I'm as hearty as a bear, and hope these
few lines will find you, and
              mother, and
grandfather
,
and cousin Debby, and
              all the children,
enjoying
the same blessing. We stood our march
remarkable
well, and are all alive, and safe, and
sound as a whistle. And Sargent Johnson makes
a most capital officer. He's jest sich a man as is
wanted down
              herethere's no skeering him, I can
tell you. He'd fight against
              bears, and wild-cats,
and the British, and thunder and lightnin', and
any
              thing else, that should set out to meddle with
our disputed territory. And he's
              taken a
master-liking
to me, too, and says if he has any hard
fighting
to do, although I'm the youngest in the
company
,
he shall always choose me first for his
right-hand
man. He says I had more pluck at the
drafting than any one in the whole
              company, and
he should rather have me by his side in battle,
than any
              three of the rest of'em. But maybe you'd
like to hear something about our march
              down
here, and so on.
For the first four or five hours, we marched rather
too fast, and got pretty
              nigh tuckered out; for we
was all so arnest to get down there before the first
battle come on, that we almost run half the time.
At last, about one
              o'clock, Billy Wigginsyou
know what a short-legged little fat chunk
              of a
thing he ishe begun to lag behind a good deal,
and puffed
              and sweat as bad as our colt when we
plough alone with him. At last, as I said
              afore,
about one o'clock, Billy Wiggins, who had got
away a good many rods behind us, stopt short in
the middle of the road, and
              called out to Sargent
Johnson as loud as he could holler, and says he,
It's no use; I can't run like a hoss all day,
and without a mouthful
              to eat, tu. I'm half
starved
now, and as tired as a dog. I say, Sargent
Johnson, we must stop and rest
              a little while, and
have something to eat, or I can't keep up with you
no
              longer, and it's no use to try.
At that Sargent Johnson ordered us to halt till
Billy come up. So the poor
              feller come puffing
along up to us, and rubbing his arm across his
forehead to wipe the sweat off; and the sargent
told him, bein' it was past one
              o'clock, we'd halt,
and have some refreshments. There was a house
a little
              ways ahead of us, and a plenty of wood
piled round the door-way, that would make
              good
seats for us to set down on; so we marched along
up to it, and
              halted, and sot down on the wood-pile,
and took off our knapsacks, and got out
              our
victuals, and begun to eat our dinner. Presently,
the old gentleman of
              the house looked out of the
window and see us, and he opened the door, and
come right out to us, without any hat on, and says
he,
My boys, are you going down to fight for our
disputed
              territory?
Sargent Johnson told him, that was jest exactly
what we was up to.
That's right, said the old gentleman, and
you
              look like brave fellers, too. Our company
started off yesterday, and one of my
              boys has gone
with it. I hope you'll be able to get there about
as soon as
              they do, so that our side may be
strong-handed
before the first fight comes on.
Sargent Johnson told him he was determined to
be there before the first battle
              come on, if possible,
and meant to have a hand in't too.
Ah, you're the boys for me, said the old
gentleman
;
if I was a few years younger,
              and wasn't
quite so lame, I believe I should go with you.
Did you ever
              hear any thing so impudent as 'twas
for them British to carry off our land agent
              as they
did? and then to be stealin' logs on our disputed
territorywhy, it makes my blood bile, when I
think of it. But, come,
              don't set out here on the
wood-pile; come, go into the house and eat your
dinners, and you shall have as much of my cider as
you can drink.
We thanked him, and told him we didn't keer if
we did. So we went in, and had a
              good drink of
cider with our victuals, and sot and rested
ourselves
nearly an hour, and then marched along
again. We took it a little slower
              in the afternoon,
so that Billy Wiggins made out to keep up with
us pretty
              well.
We got to Augusta about sunset; and jest as
we was marching along by the
              State-house, which
is a very fine building, more than as big again as
our
              barn, and all made of hewed stone, and stands
up on a little hill, pretty near
              the road; so, jest as
we got along against the State-house, the
Legislater
was adjourned, and the folks was all coming
out in a heap, right down
              towards the road.
Halt, cried Sargent Johnson, all at once.
Left
              face; front, dress; rear rank close to the
front: heads up.
Then he run along and whispered to us, and
says he, Now boys, we'll
              give 'em a solute; and
I want you should do it man-fashion. Now you
mind
              and have your guns well shouldered, and be
very careful to mind the word of
              command, and
all shoot at once. You must mind and pint your guns
high, so as to go over every body's heads, for you
know there's balls in
              'emand these ain't the
British folks that we are going to fire at
              now,
remember
that. I shall give the word of command,
make ready, take aim, fire
and when you hear the
word fire, you must pull trigger all at once, and
blaze away like
              thunder.
We all told him we would, and he went along
and took his stand at the head of
              the company.
We'd all kept our guns well loaded during the
day, for fear
              what might happen, and we
shouldered
'em as the sargent told us, and got all fixed,
and stood with stiff upper
              lips, and all ready to
fire. Jest as the main body of the legislater-folks
and the people got along down within about two
rods of the road where we stood,
              Sargent Johnson
hollered out, with a good loud military voice,
Make ready
Crack!
went Billy Wiggins' gunsmoke,
powder
,
wad, and every thing blazing into the air. I
never see any body so struck up as Sargent
Johnson
washe coloured as red as a blaze, and looked
as if he would a
              bit Billy Wiggins' head off. But
when he see the rest of us held on, and didn't
              pull,
he plucked up courage again, and give the rest of
the word of command. Take aimFire
In a moment we all pulled, pretty near together,
tu, and if we didn't give 'em
              a real stunder, I
won't guess again. Some of the people jumped,
and some
              squat like geese going into a barn door.
But when they found nobody wasn't
              killed, they
come along down to the road, and inquired of
Sargent
Johnson what town we come from, and shook
hands with us, and seemed to be
              very glad to see
us, and said they was glad we'd got along; for
things
              looked terrible squally down to our disputed
territory, and the sooner we could
              get there the
better.
Bime-by Governor Fairfield come out of the
State-house, and come along down to
              the road, and
says he,
My brave fellow-soldiers, I'm glad to see you,
what town do you come
              from?
Sargent Johnson told him we was the
Smithville
detachment, and was on our way down to our
disputed territory, and if he
              had any commands to
send that way, we should be happy to carry 'em.
The
              governor's a little piece of a man to look at;
but they say he's got grit enough
              aboard for two
8
common sized men. He said he had no particular
commands to send by us,
              only he wanted us to get
down there as quick as we possibly could, and
report
ourselves to Colonel Jarvis, and he would take
command of us, and tell us
              what to do. And, says
he, I want you to tell Jarvis to hold on down
there like a dog to a root, and not give up an inch
to them British chaps;
              if he wants more men, only
send word to me, and he shall have 'em by
regiments
,
as many as he wants. But tell him never
to give up an inch; if Sir John Harvey fretslet
him fret. But
              above all, tell Jarvis
to hold on to
the logs
, live or
              die. And now my brave fellers,
said the governor, it's too
              late for you to go any
further to-night; you shall have a chance to sleep
in one of the lobbies of the State-house, and I'll
see that you have victuals
              and drink provided for
you; and I want you to be under way again by
sunrise in the morning, whether I am up or not.
So we bid the governor good night, and he sent a
man to show us the way into
              the State-house, and
to bring us what we wanted to eat and drink. And
we
              fared well, too, I can tell youa plenty of
bread and meat, and hot
              coffee, and a basket of
apples. We helped ourselves you may depend, as
though we hadn't had any thing to eat for a month.
The legislater-folks come back in crowds and
flocked
round the door, and a great many of 'em come
in and talked with us about
              the war down in our
disputed territory. They all said the land was
ourn,
              every inch of it, and we must stick to it, and
not give up a single tree; for
              the legislater was
determined to stand by us, and would vote to pay
all
              the expenses. After they'd all cleared out, we
laid down and took a nap. And
              about an hour
before sunrise I got up and looked out, and see
'twas all
              broad daylight; so I went and touched
Sargent Johnson, and told him 'twas time
              to be
stirring. He sprung on his feet quicker than if
he'd been shot, and
              says he, Where? where?
where be they? I'm ready for 'em. Give me my
gun! give me my sword! Stand by, boys, I'll go
ahead! Where be
              they?
And then he begun to rub his eyes, and looked
round and see me, and says he,
Oh, John, is it you? I believe I was dreaming.
I thought the enemy
              was jest a breaking into our
camp, and I was going to send daylight through
'em about the quickest. And then he looked out
of the window,
              and says he, By zounds! it's
morning; come, John, call'em up, and let us have
a bite of something to eat and be a going.
So I roused them all out, and we got some
breakfast, and got all ready to start
              a little before
sunrise. We found out where the governor
boarded, and
              Sargent Johnson said he meant to
give him a salute as we went by, if he
wasn't
up.
So when we got along against the house, he give
the word to fire, and we blazed away like a clap
of thunder. In a minute
              the governor come
running
to the window in his shirt sleeves, and he
opened the window and looked
              out, and says
he
That's you my brave fellers, you are the sort
for me. I never shall
              be afraid of the British
while I have sich fellow-soldiers as you are. Tell
Jarvis to stick to the old line; we'll have the line
of '83, come what
              will. And don't forget to tell
Jarvis to mind and
hold on to
                the logs
.
He wished us a speedy march, and shot down
the window, and we jogged along.
It's no use for me to try to tell you all about
the everlasting great long road
              we had to
go over to get down here; for there's more
mountains, and hills,
              and woods, and rivers,
and ponds, and brooks, and snow-banks, and
swamps, than you could shake a stick at for a
month. Our disputed territory is a
              terribly long
ways off, and there's no end to it when you get
there. We
              didn't stop to Houlton, for our orders
was to go right down into the midst of
              it, and
report
ourselves to Colonel Jarvis. So we inquired
the way along and found
              Colonel Jarvis and his
men was gone on to Fitzherbert's farm, down
close
              to the line, and was building up a fortification. We marched along till we come clear
in sight of the farm, and could see the men to
work.
Now, says Sargent Johnson, now, my boys,
is
              the time to show your best. See that your guns
are well loaded, and march up to
              the camp like
heroes.
We stopped and examined our guns to see if
they was well loaded, and as Billy
              Wiggins was
fumbling over his lock to see if the priming was
good, some
              how or other he let her go; and he
had a monstrous heavy charge in, and she
              roared
away through the woods like a harrycane. At
that, Sargent Johnson
              almost swore, and said he
wished Billy Wiggins had staid at home. But he
8*
told us to shoulder our guns and march up
quick-step
towards the camp. So we marched along,
and in a minute or two we see a
              terrible
mustering
round the camp. They come out as thick as
bees and begun to form into a
              line, and went to
loading their guns as fast as they could make their
hands fly. And a little, small, brisk man seemed
to be taking the command, and
              placing the men
this way and that, and making his bright sword
fly about
              like a streak of lightning. Sargent
Johnson told us to halt; for we begun to
              feel a
little blue all to once. We didn't know but we
had missed our road
              and got over the line, and
that night be a camp of the British. So Sargent
Johnson thought it was best to stop and
reconnoitre
a little.
Bime-by we see one chap from the camp
running towards the woods as hard as he
              could
spring.
'Tis the British, said Sargent Johnson,
'tis
              the British; and they are afraid of us; see
how that feller runs!
But in a minute we heard the brisk little man,
that had the command, bawl out
              after him to stop,
and he swung his sword round as if he'd take his
head off. The feller looked over his shoulder, but
kept along. At that the commander ketcht up a
gun and called again, and
              says he, If you don't
come right back, I'll put a ball through your
              heart
in a minute. That stopt the feller, and he come
back
              again and took his place in the ranks.
There's spunk there, said Sargent Johnson,
let
              'em belong to which side of the line they will.
If I knew they was British, we'd
              face 'em and give
'em battle at once. But I should hate to fire at
'em
              till we know, for fear they might belong to our
side.
We was a little staggered for a while to know
what was best to do. As near as
              we could see
what they was about at the camp, they was busy
to work
              getting ready to fight us. And as there
was only eleven of us, and there seemed
              to be
some hundreds of them, we thought it was best for
us to be on the
              look out, and see that they didn't
get the advantage of us. Sargent Johnson said
he didn't see how he could have missed the road,
and he couldn't hardly
              believe yet, but what they
belonged to our side. So says he
If there's any one of you that dares to go up
with a flag of truce,
              I think we better send up and
have a fair understanding with 'em before we
begin
to fight.
None of the rest of 'em started, so I told the
sargent I was the boy for him to
              send on that are
arrant. And says he
That's you, John, I knew before I spoke, you
was the man for it. So
              get ready.
But come to look round we couldn't find any
thing to make a flag of truce of;
              for Sargent
Johnson said it must be white, and we hadn't one
of us got a
              white handkerchief or any sich thing;
so we seemed to be kind of stuck. At last,
              says I,
You needn't bother about that. There's more
ways to
              kill a cat than one. So I tore off a
good large square piece of my
              shirt and tied it on
to the end of my gun, and says I
Sargent, I'm ready.'
After he told me what to say, I shouldered my
gun and marched up towards the
              camp with my
flag of truce flying. The camp stood up on a
rising ground
              about a quarter of a mile from our
company, and their soldiers was all out and
formed
in a line three or four deep. But I marched
right straight up to 'em; and
              when I got up
within
a few rods, the commanding officer come along
out with his sword in his hand and met me.
Says I
Who commands these troops?
Colonel Jarvis, says he.
I want to see him, says I.
I'm the man, says he.
Well, sir, says I, you are the very man
we've
              been looking for all day.
Well, sir, says he, I'm ready for you, let
you
              want what you will. But is Sir John Harvey
any where about here? If he is, you
              may go back
and tell him we don't want any of his flags of
truce, and no
              parleying about it; for we are
determined
to hold on to the land, every inch of it,
and the logs too, if we have to
              die in the last ditch,
and he may help himself if he can.
But, says I, my dear sir, you are mistaken;
we
              ain't Sir John Harvey's folks by a jug full. We
are the Smithville detatchment,
              under command
of Sargent Johnson, and have come down to jine
your
              forces.
Ah, ha! says the colonel, that alters the
case. So he run back and told his men how
'twas, and they set up
              three tremendous cheers
that made the woods ring again.
As soon as our company heard that, they come
running up the hill like a flock
              of sheep, and
Sargent
Johnson and the colonel was so glad to see
each other, that they shook
              hands so hard, I didn't
know but they would have pulled one another's
hands off. The colonel took us right into the
camp and give us some dinner, and
              said he was
most confounded glad we'd got along, for he'd
been
              expecting a brush with the British a number
of days.
We hain't had much chance to look about here
yet, but when we do, I'll write
              again. You
needn't be consarned about our giving up any of
our disputed
              territory, for our troops is all as fierce
as tigers about it, and Colonel
              Jarvis, though he's
a little, small, thin man, he's jest as smart as a
steel-trap.
Give my love to all the folks, and I remain your
loving son,
JOHN.
Dear Gineral, my son's letter is so long, I
haven't got time to add another
              word.
Yours,
JOHN SMITH, ESQUIRE.
LETTER VI.
Wherein young John Smith describeth the desperate seige of the
logging camp, and the memorable capture of the loggers.
Smithville, Down East, in the state of
                  Mains
,
March
24, 1839.
Dear Gineral
I've jest got another letter from
my son John, down in our disputed territory, and
as I know you feel anxious to
              hear how they get
along down there, I hasten to send you a copy of
it. It
              is as follers:
Our Disputed Territory, pretty near the
Line
,
March
, 20, 1839.
Dear Father
Tell mother I ain't shot yet,
though we've had one pretty considerable of a
brush, and expect every day to
              have some more.
Colonel Jarvis has took quite a liking to our little
Smithville detachment. He says we are the
smartest troops he's got, and as long as we stick
by him, it isn't Sir John
              Harvey, nor all
New-Brumzick
,
nor even Queen
              Victory herself can
ever drive him off of Fitzherbert's farm. Perhaps
you
              mayn't remember much about this
Fitzherbert's
farm, where we are. It is the very place
where the British nabbed our Land
              Agent, Mr.
McIntire, when he was abed, and asleep, and
couldn't help
              himself, and carried him off to
Frederiction
jail. Let 'em come and try to nab us, if
they dare; if they wouldn't wish
              their cake was
dough again, I'm mistaken. We've got up pretty
considerable
              of a little kind of a fort here, and we
keep it manned day and
              nightwe don't more than
half of us sleep to once, and are determined
              the
British shall never ketch us with both eyes shet.
But I 'spose mother's in dreadful fidgets to know
about the brush, that I
              mentioned in the first part
of my letter, so I must make haste and get along
to it. It wasn't exactly a scratch with the
British soldiers, but
              something jest about as bad,
and I don't know but a little worse, for it was
              along
with them thieving trespassers, that's been cutting
down our trees,
              and stealin' our logs. And I think
9
I should as lives run my chance among soldiers as
among thieves.
That night arter we got here, when the sentries
was all placed round the fort,
              and the things all
put up for the night, Colonel Jarvis asked us to go
in
              and set down and have a chat. So we did; and
he asked us all about our march
              down here to our
disputed territory, and what the news was to home,
and if
              we see the governor as we come along, and
if he sent any word to him, and so on.
              Sargent
Johnson told him all about it, and told him the
governor was
              terrible arnest for him to
hold on to
the logs;
and said
              he mustn't never flinch a hair,
nor give up an inch of our disputed territory,
              let
what would come, and he must put a stop to their
cutting down our
              timber.
Colonel Jarvis said, the governor might let him
alone for that; if Sir John
              Harvey got hold of any
of them logs, he would have to get up airlier in the
morning than ever he did yet.
Now, Sargent Johnson, said the Colonel,
you
              are a smart officer, and you've got a smart
little company here; and bein'
              you've jest come
into the service, it wouldn't be no more than fair
that
              you should have a chance to take hold of some
kind of a job that should be an honour to you and
your company, and show to the people of the state
what sort of grit you
              are made of. I think it's
very likely there's some of them are thieving chaps
about here in the woods yet, cutting down our
timber; and you may take
              your men in the
morning
,
and load up your guns and
              go off on a cruise,
and see if you can ketch any of the rascals, and
bring
              'em and their teams off here prisoners of
war; and the rest of us 'll stay here
              and guard the
fort while you are gone. If the rascals set out to
fight,
              don't show 'em no quarter, but take 'em, dead
or alive, and bring 'em off to the
              fort.
Sargent Johnson told him, that was jest sich a
job as we should
              like, and we'd be out in the
morning
bright and airly and go at it.
Accordingly, as soon as it was daylight in the
morning, I turned out and gave
              Sargent Johnson
a touch, and told him 'twas time to be starting. He
was on
              his feet as quick as a wink, and told me to
call the men and tell them to get
              ready. In a few
minutes we got our breakfasts, and put some
dinner
in our knapsacks, and see that our guns was
all well loaded; and after the
              Colonel told us which
way we better go, we marched off, and struck right
into the woods.
We had rather tough getting about, pretty much
all the forenoon, scratching
              about through the
bushes, and climbing over logs and stones, and
working
              our way through the swamps; but
towards
noon we begun to come along into the
timber
land. And, my stars! sich great whapping
pine trees, as straight as a
              candle, and tall as a
liberty-pole, and standing all round as thick as the
bean-poles in our garden, I guess you never see.
Ah, says Sargent Johnson, this is the place
where them thieving chaps picks their
huckleberries
.
We shall get upon the track of some of 'em
bime-by!
At last we come to a pretty considerable of a kind
of a little river. Sargent
              Johnson told us to keep
a sharp look out now, for they hauled the logs into
these small rivers and brooks, and in the spring, when
the ice broke up,
              they would shoot 'em along out
into the Aroostook river, and then scoot 'em away
off down the St. John's river, and carry 'em off to
England, and nobody
              knows where. We followed
the river up a mile or two, and I was away a little
ways ahead of the rest, and at last I heard a sharp
kind of a click, like the sound of an axe chopping
wood. I listened a spell, and then I heard it again;
and I told Sargent
              Johnson we was close upon 'em,
for I could hear 'em chop. At that we all stopped
and listened, and we could hear 'em as plain as
day. Sargent Johnson then
              told us to see that the
primin' in our guns was all right, and to foller him
as still as mice. So we crept along as careful as
if we was going on eggs.
              Bime-by we got on to a
little piece of rising ground, where we could look
down towards the bend of the river, and there we
see 'em as busy at work as a
              thief in a mill. They
had a little log cabin for themselves, and another
one for their oxen; and one chap was jest driving
the oxen in, to give 'em some
              hay, and the rest was
going in to dinner; all but the one that we heard
chopping; and he was digging his axe into the side
of a great large pine tree,
              as big round as a
hogset
.
Bime-by one of 'em come to
              the door and
hollered to him, and told him to come into dinner,
for the
              beans was all turned out, and growin' cold.
But he said the beans might go to
              pot for what he
keered, for he wouldn't come in till he got his tree
down,
              any how. So he kept his axe a going, click,
click, and we kept still and looked
              on. We see
9*
the tree was pretty nigh off; and bime-by we heard
a crack, and then a
              little louder crack; and we
looked up, and see the top begun to lean and
tremble
a littleit was a monstrous great big tree
and then
              the cracks come quicker and louder;
crack, crack, double crack, and the old tree
              begun
to whisk through among the tops of the other trees
with a roaring
              sound like a harrycane, and then, in
two winks of a hum-bird's eye, it went
              crash on
to the ground like a clap of thunder, and made all
smoke again.
By king, said Sargent Johnson, if that's the
way they steal our timber, I think it's a caution.
After the tree was down, the chap stuck his axe
into the stump, jest as when
              any body's a readin'
he puts his finger on where he left off, and then he
went into the camp to dinner.
Now, says Sargent Johnson, now's the time;
while they are at dinner we'll surround the camp,
and take 'em by
              surprise.
We looked down on to the bank of the river, and
we see two or three everlastin'
              great piles of logs,
as big as two or three houses, that they had cut,
and
              hauled, and rolled down the bank. This made
some of our company feel a little
              blue, for fear they
might be too many for us; and they asked
Sargent
Johnson if we hadn't better wait till they come
out of the camp, so we
              could see how many there
was of 'em. For there was only eleven of us, and
by the great pile of logs they had hauled down to
the river, there might be a
              hundred of them.
Sargent Johnson said he didn't care if there was
five hundred; he'd surround
              their camp and take
'em prisoners. And says he,
If any of you is cowards, you may turn about
and go back now, and
              them that stays will have
the honour all to ourselves.
At that they coloured up some, and said they was
no cowards, but was ready to
              go as fur as
he
would.
So Sargent Johnson then give us off the plan of
the campaign. And says
              he
You see there is a door to the cabin, and it
stands a little ways
              open; and you see there's
holes cut out through two sides of the cabin for
windows. Now we must creep as still as
midnight
,
so
              that they shan't see us nor hear us, and
when we've surrounded the cabin, I'll
              give a little
bit of a low whistle, and in a moment, two of you
must poke
              your guns right into them windows, and
I'll step right into the middle of the door with my
sword in one hand and my gun in 'tother, and two
more of you must spring
              right behind me and poke
your guns in over my shoulders, one over my right
shoulder and 'tother over my left shoulder; and
the rest of you must stand off,
              all ready to fire,
about two rods from the camp, as a core deserve.
Colonel Jarvis says it's always best to keep a core
deserve, when you are goin'
              to make an attack.
And as soon as I've got in the middle of the door,
and
              staring of 'em right in the face, I'll sing out
to 'em like
              thunder`Now you rascally stealin'
chaps, now I've got you; now if you
              don't give up
in a minute, we'll shoot you down like squirrels.'
And I
              guess that'll fetch 'em tu. If it don't, and
they set out to fight, why then we
              must fight,
that's all; and that's what we come down for.
After Sargent Johnson had given us our orders,
we told him we understood 'em,
              and would stick
to him through thick and thin. So we crawled
along towards
              the camp as fast and as still as we
could. We had to climb right over that
              thunderin'
great big tree that they jest fell, because it was
sich a bad
              place to get round ary end of it. But
at last we got along up within three or
              four rods
of the camp and Sargent Johnson made a sign for
us to halt, so we might all get ready; and come to
look round, one was
              missing, for there wasn't but
ten of us. And come to look round to see who it
was, it was Billy Wiggins. Sargent Johnson
looked cross enough, and a
              little surprised too;
for he said, for all Billy was sich a fumbling,
clumsy little chap, he never thought he was a
coward. At that I looked back the
              way we come,
and I see Billy's head bobbing up and down
behind
that great pine tree, as he was jumping up
with all his might and trying
              to climb up on to it.
I see in a minute what the difficulty was; he
couldn't get up on to the tree, and he didn't dare
to holler, for that would
              muster 'em out of the
cabin. So I run back and jumped up on to the
tree
              and got hold of Billy's hand and hauled him
over. And we pretty soon got all
              ready to make
the attack. Every man had his gun pinted
towards
the cabin and all ready to pull. I and
Jonathan
Downing was to stand behind Sargent
Johnson
and pint our guns over his shoulders; and Seth
Josslyn was to stand to one
              window and Billy
Wiggins to 'tother. As soon as we was all ready,
Sargent
              Johnson give a little, easy whistle, and
we all sprung to our places; but before Sargent
Johnson had time to begin to speak, Billy
Wiggins's
gunI guess there must be something the
matter with Billy's
              forefinger, for his gun blazed
away like lightning into the cabin window, and
              his
ball went splash right into a log on 'tother side. And
all in the same
              breath the rest of our guns was all
pokin' in on every side, and Sargent Johnson
              was
bawling out to 'em with his roaring voice and
calling
of'em stealin' rascals. Oh, father! I wish
you'd
              been there. If you ever see a flock of mice
in the buttery nibbling round a pan
              of meal, and
see the old cat jump right into the window and
land right
              down in the middle on 'em, and see how
them mice
went it
,
              you might guess a little how
them prisoners of ourn jumped and sprung round
and screamed. As I was looking right in over
Sargent Johnson's shoulder, I
              could see the whole
on't. There was six of 'em, and they was all
setting
round the table eating their dinners. They
had a great large milk-pan in
              the middle of the
table full of baked beans and three or four pounds
of
              fat pork on the top of it; and a kettle of soup
on one end of the table, and
              bread and potatoes
and so on, all over the table. And when the
thunder-clap broke upon 'em all to once, they all
sprung right up as if they'd gone out of their
skins; and the table went like a
              lock of hay in a
whirlwind. It bounced up in the first place
almost
to the roof of the cabin; and when it
came down, the beans flew from one
              side of
the room to the other, like shot in a
pepper-box
;
and the soup-kettle and the bread and the
dishes and
              the potatoes I couldn't keep the run of.
After the first scream was over, and they see
they wasn't killed, one of 'em
              sprung and
ketched
a handspike that they had to stir the fire
with, and another ketched up a
              stool that they
had to set on, and another run behind the door
and brought
              out an old gun. But when they
see our guns pokin' in round so thick, they
sprung into the corners and squat down behind
the barrels, and begun to holler
              don't fire!
don't fire! At last after they begun to get
still a little, so he could be heard, Sargent
Johnson
told 'em to lay down their arms. At that,
one laid down his handspike,
              t'other one his gun,
and things begun to get considerable quiet.
Then Sargent Johnson asked 'em if they was
willing to surrender themselves prisoners of war.
At that, one of 'em that seemed to be the head
man among 'em, a short,
              thick, fat man, with a
red face and a blueish nose, stepped forward and
asked Sargent Johnson what he wanted. The
sargent told him they must deliver
              themselves
up as prisoners of war and be carried to the
American camp.
And then what is to be done with us? said
he.
Well, then, you'll have to be sent to Bangor,
to be tried for
              stealing the logs on our disputed
territory, said Sargent Johnson.
Well, then, we'll die first, said he, and he sprung
back
              and ketched up the gun. But when he
looked
round and see the rest of his men was as white
as a cloth and quivering
              behind the barrels, and
see our guns all pinted right at him, he see 'twas
no use. And says he, Captain don't fire, I'll
give up. And
              he brought his gun and give it to
Sargent Johnson. Then Sargent Johnson
ordered
'em to come out two by two, and we took and
tied them together by twos, so
              we could guard 'em
easy; and then we went to the hovel and took out
the oxen. There was two yoke of oxen and a
hoss; and we yoked 'em up and loaded all the
provisions they had in the camp and
              started off
for our fort. Jonathan Downing drove the oxen;
and Billy
              WigginsSargent Johnson said Billy
was sich an unlucky kind of a
              feller he had no
patience with him; but after all, he said he didn't
know
              but what his gun goin' off so, did about as
much good as any thingso
              on the whole, bein'
he had sich short legs, he said Billy Wiggins
should
              ride the hoss.
So when we all got ready, we marched off
towards
our fort, and got back jest about sunset.
And as we was coming up the hill
              towards the fort,
they all come out to meet us and give us a salute.
I
              guess you never see a man more tickled than
Colonel Jarvis was. He hopped up and
              down and
slapped Sargent Johnson on the shoulder more
than forty times;
              and declared if the oxen was
only fat enough, we'd have one of 'em roasted
whole the next day for dinner.
But I can't say any more to-day; so give my
love to the folks, and I remain
              your loving son,
JOHN.

Dear Gineral, so much for my son John's
second
grist. Don't you think he grinds it out pretty
well for a boy that isn't
              seventeen years old yet?
Yours,
JOHN SMITH, ESQUIRE.
LETTER VII.
Wherein young John Smith describeth the bravery of the
Smithville
detachment in toeing the mark, and also their unparalleled
success in capturing the British Lion.
Smithville, Down East, in the state of Maine,
March
30, 1839.
Dear Gineral
.I've got another letter from my
son John down to the boundary war; and as I
'spose you like to have 'em pretty
              well by your
putting of 'em in your papers, I make haste to
send you a
              copy of this by the first post. It is as
follers.
Our Disputed Territory pretty near the Line, on
Fitzherbert's farm
,
March
25, 1839.
Dear Father
We stick by here yet, takin' care
of our disputed territory and the logs; and while
we stay here the British will
              have to walk as
straight as a hair, you may depend. We ain't had
much fighting to do since my last letter; and some
how or other, things
              seem to be getting cooler
down here a little, so that I'm afraid we ain't agoing
to have the real scratch, after all, that I wanted to
have. A day or two
              arter we took the logging
camp and brought the men and oxen off here
prisoners
of war, we was setting in the fort after
dinner
and talking matters over, and Sargent
Johnson
was a wondering what a plague was the
reason
the British didn't come up to the scratch as
they talked on. He said he
              guessed they wasn't
sich mighty fairce fellers for war as they
pretended
to be, arter all.
Well, said Colonel Jarvis, I got some
despatches
from Governor Fairfield this morning,
that says Sir John Harvey seems to
              be a little
inclined to haul in his horns; and I don't believe
they'll try
              to drive us out of our disputed
territory
,
or come
              a near us. But still the
governor
says we must hold on and look out sharp,
for he don't know how 'twill turn
              out yet; and
we must keep possession of the territory, and
not let any
              body come into it, nor any logs go
out of it, till we have further
              orders.
10*
Well, says Sargent Johnson, I don't like
this
              staying about here doing nothing; I ain't used
to it. If them British are any
              notion of coming
here and having a tug with us, I wish they'd
come and
              have it over. Why don't we go clear
to the line, colonel? How do we know but
              what
they'll get over this side on't sometimes, if we
ain't there to see
              to it? And besides, I want to
see
that boundary line, that I've heard so much tell
of; and I'm determined to
              see it before I go
home, if I have to march down to it all alone;
so I can
              have it to tell my children of, when I
get to be an old man, and can say to 'em,
              I
have seen the boundary line myself, and
marched
clear down to it and stood on it.
Here I couldn't help putting in a word tu;
and says I
So do I, colonel, I want to see that are
boundary line, and go right
              up to it, and
toe the
mark;
I never was dared to toe the
              mark yet,
but what I did it, let who would stand t'other
side. And I
              should like to go right up to this
line, and put my toes on to it, and look over
              on
to the British side, and stump them to come up to
it if they
              dared.
At that Colonel Jarvis turned round and
looked
at me, and haw-hawed right out; and, says he
Well done, John, you are growing quite
wolfy. I like your spunk any
              how; but you are
young and inexperienced, and don't understand
all the
              turns of the game exactly. You hain't
seen so much war as your old great
              grandfather
has; you must try to keep cool and foller your
officers.
But, colonel, says I, do you know
grandfather
?
Yes, I do, says he; I have heard him tell
his
              war stories many a time. Didn't he give you
no good advice when you come
              away?
Nothing, says I; only he charged me not
to be
              in too much of a hurry to fire.
Well, says the colonel, you'd better
remember
that advice, and foller it. And it's a pity
Billy Wiggins hadn't a
              grandfather to advise
him.
At that Billy Wiggins rolled up his little gray
eyes at the colonel, and fairly
              looked red; and
says Billy, says he
Well, colonel, my gun goes too easy, and I
can't help it. I've been
              a squirrel hunting with it
so much, it'll almost go off itself, before you
              think
on't.
But this ain't what we was talking about,
said Sargent
              Johnson; and I don't see as it
brings us any nearer the line. As I
              said afore,
colonel, I don't like this staying about here and
doing
              nothing; and if things are getting cooled
down a little, so as like as not we
              shall have to go
off home pretty soon, I think the sooner we take
a peep
              at that boundary line the better.
The colonel said, the boundary line wasn't but a
few miles off, and we was as
              near to it now as
'twas prudent to have our head-quarters. We'd
got a good
              strong place here on Fitzherbert's farm
for a fort, and we must stick by it and
              keep it well
manned and guarded. And he said, bein'
Sargent
Johnson and his company was so good on a
scouting-party, and did so well
              t'other day when
we took the logging camp, he didn't keer if we
tried it
              again the next day. We might go out
and scour round awhile, and see if we could
              find
any more trespassers, and go down as far as the
line if we'd a mind
              to; only be careful and not get
over on t'other side of the line; for if the
              British
nabb'd us there, we should be lawful game, and it
would be hard work to make 'em give us up.
So we was all alive in a minute, fitting out for
a new campaign. We went to
              work and rubbed
up our guns, and put new flints into 'em, and got
'em so
              they'd go as quick as a stream of lightning.
And the next morning we was up by
              times and
got our breakfasts, and filled our knapsacks, and
started off.
              We hunted round most all the
forenoon
to find some more trespassers, but we
couldn't find hide nor hair of a
              single one. We
thought we must be pretty near the line, and
sometimes we
              begun to feel a little skittish for
fear we might get acrost and not know it,
              and the
British might hop up behind some of the old logs
and trees and nab
              us before we could have time to
take aim at 'em. Bime-by Billy Wiggins started
on ahead of us and run like a two-year-old, up on
to a little hill there
              was a little ways ahead; and
then he begun to climb a slim, tall pine tree, and
he hitched and scrabbled up as fast as a young
bear.
What upon earth, said Sargent Johnson,
is
              Billy arter now?
A squirrel, I guess, said I; I'll bet a
potato
,
Billy has treed a squirrel.
When we got along up a little nearer, Sargent
Johnson called out to him to know
              what he was
doing up there.
I'm jest a looking off here to see if
I can see
the line
, said Billy, stretching his neck away to
the
              eastward, and looking with all the eyes in his
head.
Well, do you see it? said Sargent Johnson.
See it? no; said Billy, I don't see nothing
but woods, and woods, as fur as I can see.
Sargent Johnson told him he guessed he would
see it quicker if he was down on
              the ground, than
he would up there. So Billy come down again,
and we
              jogged along. Bime-by we come to a tree
that had some old marks and spots on two
              sides
of it. And we looked along north and south of
this tree, for Sargent
              Johnson said the line runs
due north from the monument, and we found some
more trees marked and spotted jest like it.
Ah, says Sargent Johnson, we've found it.
This
              is the boundary line we've heard so much tell
of; we've got it at last. Now look
              and see if you
can see the British on t'other side of it; and let
every man hold on to his gun and be ready to fire
if I say the word.
We looked across the line, and looked and
looked
,
but we couldn't see nothin' but trees, and
bushes, and woods, and swamps. We
              hollered
across the line as hard as we could holler, to see
if we could
              raise any of the British, for we all felt
as if we wanted to have a brush. And
              we thought
at first they answered us; but when we come to
holler again, we
              found it was only the echo of our
own voices, that come back from the hills a
              little
ways off. So we marched along on the line two
or three miles, but
              we couldn't see nor hear
nothin'
of nobody. At last we sot down and got the
victuals out of our knapsacks
              and eat our dinners,
and rested awhile. When we got ready to start
again
              to go back to our fort, Sargent Johnson said
we should give the British one
              broadside before
we left 'em, jest to let 'em know what the Yankee
boys
              are made of. So he told us to see that our
guns was all right; and then he
              ordered us to
stand up all in a row, and
toe the line
,
              facing to the
British side; and then he give us off the word
Make ready, take aimfire.
There, says Sargent Johnson, now I can
go home contented, war or no war; for we've
poured one good grist into their own territory, and
they may help themselves if
              they can.
Then we put on our knapsacks and shouldered
our guns and started back towards
              the fort. We
fit our way along through the bushes and swamps
two or three
              miles, till we come out a little more
into the upland, and as we was walking
              along and
talking and telling how we guessed the British
wouldn't dare to
              come up and toe the line as we
had done, all at once we come across a great
              track
in the snow. We stopped and looked at it awhile,
but we couldn't
              tell what sort of a track it was.
Some guessed it was a bear, and some guessed
              it
was an ox, and some guessed it was a hoss, but
they all said it didn't
              look like nary one on 'em.
At last Billy Wiggins said, he didn't believe but
what it was the
British Lion
got over on to our
side of the boundary line. At that we all had a
good laugh, and Sargent Johnson
              said, if that was
the case we'd have a hunt for him, for no British
lion
              had a right to set his foot in our disputed
territory. So we turned off and
              followed the
track. Bime-by we looked away ahead a little
ways amongst the
              trees, and there we see it.
'Twas a great crittur, that looked some like an
ox, only 'twas about as tall and long as a hoss;
and he had a great mess
              of horns sprangling out
both sides of his head like a great bunch of dry
hemlock knots.
There, says Billy Wiggins, didn't I tell
you
              it was the British lion? Don't you see his
horns?
But, tain't the lion that has horns, it's the
unicorn that has
              horns, according to my book,
said Jonathan Downing; and I
              guess it's a
unicorn
.
No, says I, tain't a unicorn; unicorns don't
have but one horn, and this feller's got a dozen.
He stood with his head up, eating the bark off
the limbs of the trees. And as
              soon as Sargent
Johnson got up so near he could have a fair sight
of him,
              he sung out, it's a mooseit's a moose;
now we'll have some
              fun; now for a moose
chase.
As soon as the moose see us, he jumped his
whole length, and started to run. He
              threw his
head back on his shoulders, and tipped it one side,
so as to
              bring one bunch of his horns over his back,
while 'tother bunch pinted forward,
              so he could run
11
between the trees and bushes; and he jumped and
run like a young ox, and
              we arter him, as tight as
we could spring. We couldn't fire at first, for we
had forgot to load our guns again arter firing our
broadside on the line;
              and Sargent Johnson said
it was no matter about stopping to load, for if we
could get him in a good stout snow-bank, we could
take him alive. So we
              pulled foot arter him as
hard as we could go. Some of the way the snow
was
              pretty deep, and so hard we could run on the
top of it. But the moose broke
              through almost
every step, and he had sich hard work jumping
and
              floundering along, he couldn't gain ahead of
us hardly a bit. At last he got
              kind of wedged up
between some high rocks on one side, and some
old trees
              that was blowed down on 'tother side,
and there he was in as bad a fix as Billy
              Wiggins
was, behind the great pine log that I told you about
in my last
              letter. There was no chance for the
poor moose to get away, but to turn right
              back and
make his way right through among us. He looked
round at us, and
              shook his head a few times, and
bime-by he turned round and fetched a spring and
come right at us, full chisel. We sprung, some
one way and some 'tother,
              and give him a chance
to go by, and Jonathan Downing fetched him a lick
acrost his nose with his gun, and broke his gun
stock. But poor Billy
              Wiggins couldn't spring
out of the way so quick as the rest of us, and the
moose run right against him, and knocked him
head-over-heels, as much as a rod,
              and the next
jump he stepped on to one of Billy's legs, and
broke it off
              as short as a pipe-stem. We run and
helped Billy up, and found he wasn't hurt
              much,
only his leg was broke; so Sargent Johnson told
one of the men to
              stay by him, and we took arter
the moose agin. Arter we chased him about half
a mile further, he got into sich a deep snow-bank,
it stopped him. He
              jumped and floundered round,
but he couldn't get out, and only got deeper and
deeper into it, till at last he was all covered in the
snow-bank, but his
              head and horns, and there he
stuck, pretty well tired out. We walked right up
to him. His eyes looked as wild as if he'd eat us
up; but he couldn't help
              himself. We took some
strong lines that we had with us, and tied 'em to
his horns, on both sides of his head, and took a
slip-nuse round his nose, and
              trod the snow down,
and got him out of the bank. We found, by
trying
him round a little, that we could manage him
so as to lead him and drive him to the fort alive.
So we sent two hands back to bring Billy Wiggins
up; and they brought him
              along, and we took and
sot him a straddle of the moose, and told him to
hold on to the horns. Then Sargent Johnson took
command of the ropes on one
              side, and I on 'tother,
and each of us took a hand to help us hold on, and
Jonathan Downing took hold of the line that had
the slip-nuse round the nose,
              and went ahead to
pick out the best path; and the other five went
behind
              with sticks and whipped up. When we
got all fixed, we started off and made
              pretty good
headway. Poor Billy Wiggins begun to cry some,
and said he
              would never get home, now his leg was
broke; but Sargent Johnson comforted him
              up,
and told him to never mind, for if he hadn't his
leg broke,
              he might never have had a chance to
ride home to the fort in triumph on the
              British
lion. At that Billy laughed, and seemed to be in
pretty
              good spirits the rest of the way. We'd got
out pretty near the fort before we'd
              ketched the
moose, and a little before sunset we got out into
the opening,
              and was marching up the hill towards
the fort.
When we got pretty near, Colonel Jarvis come
running to meet us, and says he,
Sargent Johnson, what sort of a prisoner have
you got
              here?
Why, this is the British lion, said Sargent
Johnson;
              we took him this side of the line, and,
therefore, he's fairly our
              prisoner.
You are the boys for me, said the Colonel;
and he went
              back and told the men, and they give
three the loudest cheers for Sargent
              Johnson's
company that ever I heard. The Colonel had
supper for us in a
              few minutes, and took Billy
Wiggins into the hospital, and had his wounds
dressed, and he bids fair to do well; and took the
moose and tied him in the
              barn. Colonel Jarvis
says we must keep him alive, and carry him home
as a
              grand trophy of the war.
P. S.I want mother to send me down two pair
of stockings and a pair
              of trousers, for we've got 'em
torn out terribly down here among the bushes. So
I remain your loving son,
JOHN.

LETTER VIII.
Which containeth an account of the close of the warthe great
rejoicings at Smithville, on the return of Sargent Johnson's
company
,
and the getting up a public dinner in honour of the
Smithville
detachment.
Smithville, Down East, in the State of
                  Maine
,
April
, 20, 1839.
Dear Gineral Morris
You can't think what
rejoicings there is in Smithville. The war in our
disputed territory is all
              over; and Sargent Johnson
and his company and my son John has got back,
and nobody killed, and only one wounded, and
that's poor Billy Wiggins, that had
              his leg broke
by the moose that my son John told about in his
last letter.
              The company is all as hearty as bucks,
and look as well as they did when they
              went away,
only they've got their clothes wore out pretty bad.
They got along here yesterday noon. We was
setting to the table and jest a finishing our
              dinner,
and my wife was jest a saying, Oh, dear, I wish
I knew
              what was become of poor Johnny; we
hain't heard from him for nigh about a
              fortnight,
and I am afraid something has happened to him;
and
              she hadn't more than got the words out of her
mouth when all to once we heard a
              terrible
cracking
and a roaring, like a platoon firing at a
muster
.
We all jumped up and run to the door, and
looked out one way and 'tother,
              and as soon as we
looked away up to the top of the hill, we see
Sargent
Johnson's company jest beginning to march
down; and the smoke of their
              guns was rolling
away over their heads, where they had jest fired a
salute
              to let the folks in the village know they was
coming. As soon as we got out to
              the door my
son John see us, and he sprung out a little one
side of the
              company and jumped up on to a great
rock, and took off his hat and swung it
              round and
hoorah'd like a house a fire. At that my three
boys next to
              John, they turned to, and they
hoorah'd
as loud as they could bawl; and then they
sot out and run up the hill like
              young colts, and
when they met the company they run up to John
and tried
              to shake hands, but John never turned
his head to the right nor to the left, but marched
straight ahead like a soldier. Sargent Johnson
had give 'em their orders
              before, not to stop for
nobody nor nothin', but march straight forward
with heads up, right through the village, clear to
the tavern, and there he
              would dismiss 'em.
When they got along down against our house,
my wife was all of a didder, she
              wanted to get hold
of John so. She sot out to run right to him, and
called
              out to him, John, oh, John, ain't you going
to stop?
But Sargent Johnson shook his head at her, and
called out to his company,
              heads up, keep time!
and they marched right by us straight
              as loons.
Old grandfather by this time had hobbled out to
the door, and
              stood leaning over his staff, and
when he see them march by so straight without
stopping or looking one way or 'tother, says he
Ah, that looks military. How that company
has improved in discipline
              since they've been gone!
Why, they march as well as British regulars, and
seems to me John holds his head up and steps the
best of any of 'em.
We stood and watched 'em till they got clear up
to the tavern, and then they
              wasn't so fur off but
what we could hear Sargent Johnson give off the
word of command.
Halt; front face. Make ready; take aim;
fire. When they'd
              let go their broadside,
Sargent
Johnson made a speech to 'em, and thanked
'em for their bravery and good
              conduct while they'd
been gone, and told 'em if ever their country was
in
              danger again, he hoped they'd always be ready
to go at a moment's warning and
              fight to the last
drop of their blood, if it was necessary, to keep off
thieves and trespassers, and all sich like. And
says he
Now, my brave feller soldiers, I bid you
farewell
,
and take leave of you, as Gineral
Washington
took leave of his feller soldiers when he got
through the revolutionary
              war. I've read it in his
life, and I feel as if I wanted to cry every time I
read it. Now I'll stand here, and I want you all
to come round one arter
              another and shake hands
with me, and that'll wind the business up.
And they all marched round one arter another
and shook hands with Sargent
              Johnson, and then
he told 'em they was dismissed, and would carry
the
              thanks of their country with 'em the longest
day they lived. As soon as they was
              dismissed,
John turned and run right down towards our house
full chisel. We was all out doors waiting for him,
and sich a time as
              there was when he got there, I
guess you never see. Sich a flocking round him
and shaking hands, and sich a hugging among the
children, it beat all
              nater. My wife, she couldn't
help kissing him, for all he's sich a great boy,
              most
seventeen years old. When the first hug among
'em was over, we all
              went into the house, and old
grandfather he hobbled along and went into our
house tu, for all he's so lame he hadn't been in
before
for nigh upon six months. My wife she flew
round John like a hen that's
              found a lost chicken.
She got hold of his arm and looked in his face, and
says she
Now, Johnny, hain't you been shot no where?
Seems to me you look
              kind of pale and thin; I'm
afraid you ain't well.
John said he never felt better in his life, and as
for being shot, he hadn't
              come any wheres nigh it
but once, and that was when they took the logging
camp.
Well, John, said old grandfather, did you
mind, my boy, what I told you, not to be in too
much of a hurry to fire? Did you
              keep your fire
back till you got up so near the enemy you could
see the whites of their eyes?
Why, as to that, said John, we kept our
fire
              back till we got as fur as we could go, for we
got clear to the outer line of
              our disputed territory
and stood on it, and hollered, but there was no
enemy there. We couldn't see the whites of their
eyes nor nothin' else of 'em.
              So we let drive over
into their own territory, hit or miss; and then
turned
about and went back to the fort.
Well, that was well done, said grandfather
it
              showed your spunk, any how; and proved
that you wasn't afraid of the enemy, let
              him be
where he would.
Well, now John, says I, my son, I want to
ask
              you one question, if there's room enough for
me to get in a word edgeways. And
              that is, how
is it you got through this war so soon down there
to our
              disputed territory, and got along with it
without any more fighting? Somehow or
              other,
it seems to me it's cooled off dreadful quick; I
don't exactly
              understand it.
Nor I neither, said John; I don't exactly
understand it myself. Some say it's all owing to
Gineral Scott. They say he's
              been down to
Augusta
12
and talked to Governor Fairfield till he got
him nigh about as cool as a
              cowcumber. And then
he writ some letters to Governor Harvey of
New-brumzick
,
and coaxed him to let the matter
              drop,
till the United States should have a chance to talk
along with old
              England about it a little, and see if
they couldn't settle the hash. But some
              say they
don't think Governor Harvey would a minded
what Gineral Scott
              said, if he hadn't heard about
Sargent Johnson's company being down there so
near the line, and cutting up sich shines among the
loggers. And he might
              have heard our guns, too,
when we fired over the line, and thought it was
best for him to keep out of the way and be quiet.
At any rate, I guess, between
              Gineral Scott and
our company, that war is put a stop to for one
while.
              They say Gineral Scott is a master feller
to talk to folks and keep 'em from
              fighting; but if
they
will
fight, they must look out, for
              he'll put it
into 'em jist like old Gineral Jackson.
While we was talking Squire Bean come in,
and said the folks over to the tavern
              thought it was
best to get up a publick dinner for Sargent
Johnson
and his company, and wanted to know if I
wouldn't jine 'em. I told him I
              was perfectly
willing
to, for I believed the boys deserved a good
dinner as much as any set of fellers ever did. So
he went back to the tavern,
              and they concluded to
go right to work and get the dinner ready for
today
.
Says I, John, what a pity 'tis Gineral Scott
didn't come round this
              way from Augusta, so as to
eat this public dinner with us.
They say he never does sich things as that,"
said John;
              he never stops any where to eat
public dinners, and never goes
round
to do any
thing; but let his business be what 'twill
              and
where 'twill, he always goes straight to it and
does
it.
Well, says I, I think that's about as good
a
              way as any, arter all.
There was considerable of a bustle over to the
tavern last night and this
              morning, cooking and
getting the dinner ready; and we let two of our
gals
              go over and help 'em. John offered to go
over and help about it, but I told him,
              bein' the
dinner was goin' to be given in honour of him and
his company,
              it wouldn't look well.
Why, says he, father, who cares for looks?
looks is nothin'behaviour's all.
I told him, as to behaviour, he stood very well
on that score, but still I
              thought he better not go
over till dinner was ready.
Accordingly, to-day about twelve o'clock, they
blew the horn over to the
              tavern, and that was the
signal that the dinner was ready, and so I and
John walked over. There was about fifty
collected
there to eat the dinner, and we all marched into
the hall where the table
              was sot, and it was enough
to du any one's eyes good to look at it. A better
dinner a body couldn't hardly wish to see, even on
thanksgiving day. There
              was biled salt beef, and
pork and potatoes and cabbage, and pots of baked
pork and beans, and baked Indian puddings, and
fried pork and eggs, and pickled
              cowcumbers, and
punkin pies, and fried sassages, and soused tripe,
and
              roast spareribs, and stewed apple, and butter,
and cheese, and hot bread, and
              cider, and I don't
know what all.
Squire Bean was president of the table, and he
made Sargent Johnson set down at
              his right hand
and my son John at his left, and the rest of the
company
              along next to 'em, and we spectators sot
round the rest of the table.
So we all sot down and fell tu and eat as hearty
as bears. Them victuals didn't stand no more
chance afore us, than the British would afore
Sargent
Johnson and his company, if they'd a met 'em.
Arter we got through eating,
              Squire Bean says
Now we must have some toasts. Now bring
on the jugs of cider and the
              tumblers.
We are most all temperance folks up here in
Smithville, and don't drink much of
              any thing
stronger than cider. So they brought on five or
six gallon jugs
              full of cider, and a tumbler apiece
for about three quarters of us, and the rest
              of us
had mugs. Then Squire Bean says
Now, gentlemen, please to charge for my
toast.
So we poured out the cider all round, and got
all ready, and then Squire Bean
              got up and says
he
Now, gentlemen, I give you the memory of one
our feller soldiers
              that's been wounded in the cause
of his country, and by that means prevented
              from
jining with us on this festival occasion. I give
you the memory of
              Billy Wigginsa leetle apt to
go off too quick, but always good spunk,
              and as
ready to put it into the British if they don't let our
12*
disputed territory alone and quit stealing our logs,
as I am to pour this
              cider down my throat.
At that we took a drink round and then give
three cheers for Billy Wiggins. And
              then Squire
Bean says
Now, gentlemen, please to charge for Sargent
Johnson's
              toast.
We poured out again and got ready, and then
Sargent Johnson got up, and says
              he
Gentlemen, I give you the memory of Sir
John Harvey. He wasn't a bit
              too perlite in his
letter to Gineral Scott, calling of him his dear
friend, and all that, for if it hadn't a been for
Gineral Scott, we should a
              given him the most
confounded licking that ever he had.
At that we begun to give three cheers for
Governor Harvey, but Squire Bean sung
              out to
us to stop, and told us not to give 'em to Governor
Harvey, but to
              Gineral Scott. So we give three
rousin' cheers for Gineral Scott. Then Squire
Bean told us to please to charge for a toast from
John Smith the tenth.
              This was my son John,
setting on the left hand of the cheer. I felt a
little
uneasy for fear John might not get through it
very well, for he never had
              done sich a job afore;
but when we got ready, John sprung up and
looked
as sharp as he did that night he listed to go to
the war, and says
              he
Gentlemen, I give you our disputed territory;
a most capital place
              to get pine logs, to ketch
moose, and to teach the British how to
toe the
mark
.
Then we give three cheers for the disputed
territory
;
and Squire Bean told us to please to charge
for Mr. Jonathan Downing's
              toast. So we
poured
out and got all ready again; and Jonathan
Downing got up, and says
              he
Gentlemen, I give you the British loggers on
our disputed territory.
              They have to knock under,
whenever the Yankees come among 'em; there's
no
              mistake about it. But about one thing, we
must give in, that they can beat us a
              leetle. We
ain't slow at pork and beans, as we have proved
at our dinner
              here to-day; but we must
acknowledge
,
that them
              loggers sometimes
make the beans
fly
a leetle faster than
              we do.
At that we hoorah'd, and give three cheers for
the loggers, beans and all.
There was a good many more toasts before we
got through, but it's got so late I
              hain't got time
to write 'em off before the post goes. We had a
very good time, and got through about two o'clock,
and cleared out for
              home. There wasn't nobody
intoxicated, for all we dreaned the cider jugs pretty
close. So I remain your old friend and subscriber,
JOHN SMITH, ESQUIRE.Our Disputed Territory, pretty near the
                  Line
,
March the
13
th
, 1839.
Dear Father
I take my pen in hand to let you
know that I'm as hearty as a bear, and hope these
few lines will find you, and
              mother, and
grandfather
,
and cousin Debby, and
              all the children,
enjoying
the same blessing. We stood our march
remarkable
well, and are all alive, and safe, and
sound as a whistle. And Sargent Johnson makes
a most capital officer. He's jest sich a man as is
wanted down
              herethere's no skeering him, I can
tell you. He'd fight against
              bears, and wild-cats,
and the British, and thunder and lightnin', and
any
              thing else, that should set out to meddle with
our disputed territory. And he's
              taken a
master-liking
to me, too, and says if he has any hard
fighting
to do, although I'm the youngest in the
company
,
he shall always choose me first for his
right-hand
man. He says I had more pluck at the
drafting than any one in the whole
              company, and
he should rather have me by his side in battle,
than any
              three of the rest of'em. But maybe you'd
like to hear something about our march
              down
here, and so on.
For the first four or five hours, we marched rather
too fast, and got pretty
              nigh tuckered out; for we
was all so arnest to get down there before the first
battle come on, that we almost run half the time.
At last, about one
              o'clock, Billy Wigginsyou
know what a short-legged little fat chunk
              of a
thing he ishe begun to lag behind a good deal,
and puffed
              and sweat as bad as our colt when we
plough alone with him. At last, as I said
              afore,
about one o'clock, Billy Wiggins, who had got
away a good many rods behind us, stopt short in
the middle of the road, and
              called out to Sargent
Johnson as loud as he could holler, and says he,
It's no use; I can't run like a hoss all day,
and without a mouthful
              to eat, tu. I'm half
starved
now, and as tired as a dog. I say, Sargent
Johnson, we must stop and rest
              a little while, and
have something to eat, or I can't keep up with you
no
              longer, and it's no use to try.
At that Sargent Johnson ordered us to halt till
Billy come up. So the poor
              feller come puffing
along up to us, and rubbing his arm across his
forehead to wipe the sweat off; and the sargent
told him, bein' it was past one
              o'clock, we'd halt,
and have some refreshments. There was a house
a little
              ways ahead of us, and a plenty of wood
piled round the door-way, that would make
              good
seats for us to set down on; so we marched along
up to it, and
              halted, and sot down on the wood-pile,
and took off our knapsacks, and got out
              our
victuals, and begun to eat our dinner. Presently,
the old gentleman of
              the house looked out of the
window and see us, and he opened the door, and
come right out to us, without any hat on, and says
he,
My boys, are you going down to fight for our
disputed
              territory?
Sargent Johnson told him, that was jest exactly
what we was up to.
That's right, said the old gentleman, and
you
              look like brave fellers, too. Our company
started off yesterday, and one of my
              boys has gone
with it. I hope you'll be able to get there about
as soon as
              they do, so that our side may be
strong-handed
before the first fight comes on.
Sargent Johnson told him he was determined to
be there before the first battle
              come on, if possible,
and meant to have a hand in't too.
Ah, you're the boys for me, said the old
gentleman
;
if I was a few years younger,
              and wasn't
quite so lame, I believe I should go with you.
Did you ever
              hear any thing so impudent as 'twas
for them British to carry off our land agent
              as they
did? and then to be stealin' logs on our disputed
territorywhy, it makes my blood bile, when I
think of it. But, come,
              don't set out here on the
wood-pile; come, go into the house and eat your
dinners, and you shall have as much of my cider as
you can drink.
We thanked him, and told him we didn't keer if
we did. So we went in, and had a
              good drink of
cider with our victuals, and sot and rested
ourselves
nearly an hour, and then marched along
again. We took it a little slower
              in the afternoon,
so that Billy Wiggins made out to keep up with
us pretty
              well.
We got to Augusta about sunset; and jest as
we was marching along by the
              State-house, which
is a very fine building, more than as big again as
our
              barn, and all made of hewed stone, and stands
up on a little hill, pretty near
              the road; so, jest as
we got along against the State-house, the
Legislater
was adjourned, and the folks was all coming
out in a heap, right down
              towards the road.
Halt, cried Sargent Johnson, all at once.
Left
              face; front, dress; rear rank close to the
front: heads up.
Then he run along and whispered to us, and
says he, Now boys, we'll
              give 'em a solute; and
I want you should do it man-fashion. Now you
mind
              and have your guns well shouldered, and be
very careful to mind the word of
              command, and
all shoot at once. You must mind and pint your guns
high, so as to go over every body's heads, for you
know there's balls in
              'emand these ain't the
British folks that we are going to fire at
              now,
remember
that. I shall give the word of command,
make ready, take aim, fire
and when you hear the
word fire, you must pull trigger all at once, and
blaze away like
              thunder.
We all told him we would, and he went along
and took his stand at the head of
              the company.
We'd all kept our guns well loaded during the
day, for fear
              what might happen, and we
shouldered
'em as the sargent told us, and got all fixed,
and stood with stiff upper
              lips, and all ready to
fire. Jest as the main body of the legislater-folks
and the people got along down within about two
rods of the road where we stood,
              Sargent Johnson
hollered out, with a good loud military voice,
Make ready
Crack!
went Billy Wiggins' gunsmoke,
powder
,
wad, and every thing blazing into the air. I
never see any body so struck up as Sargent
Johnson
washe coloured as red as a blaze, and looked
as if he would a
              bit Billy Wiggins' head off. But
when he see the rest of us held on, and didn't
              pull,
he plucked up courage again, and give the rest of
the word of command. Take aimFire
In a moment we all pulled, pretty near together,
tu, and if we didn't give 'em
              a real stunder, I
won't guess again. Some of the people jumped,
and some
              squat like geese going into a barn door.
But when they found nobody wasn't
              killed, they
come along down to the road, and inquired of
Sargent
Johnson what town we come from, and shook
hands with us, and seemed to be
              very glad to see
us, and said they was glad we'd got along; for
things
              looked terrible squally down to our disputed
territory, and the sooner we could
              get there the
better.
Bime-by Governor Fairfield come out of the
State-house, and come along down to
              the road, and
says he,
My brave fellow-soldiers, I'm glad to see you,
what town do you come
              from?
Sargent Johnson told him we was the
Smithville
detachment, and was on our way down to our
disputed territory, and if he
              had any commands to
send that way, we should be happy to carry 'em.
The
              governor's a little piece of a man to look at;
but they say he's got grit enough
              aboard for two
8
common sized men. He said he had no particular
commands to send by us,
              only he wanted us to get
down there as quick as we possibly could, and
report
ourselves to Colonel Jarvis, and he would take
command of us, and tell us
              what to do. And, says
he, I want you to tell Jarvis to hold on down
there like a dog to a root, and not give up an inch
to them British chaps;
              if he wants more men, only
send word to me, and he shall have 'em by
regiments
,
as many as he wants. But tell him never
to give up an inch; if Sir John Harvey fretslet
him fret. But
              above all, tell Jarvis
to hold on to
the logs
, live or
              die. And now my brave fellers,
said the governor, it's too
              late for you to go any
further to-night; you shall have a chance to sleep
in one of the lobbies of the State-house, and I'll
see that you have victuals
              and drink provided for
you; and I want you to be under way again by
sunrise in the morning, whether I am up or not.
So we bid the governor good night, and he sent a
man to show us the way into
              the State-house, and
to bring us what we wanted to eat and drink. And
we
              fared well, too, I can tell youa plenty of
bread and meat, and hot
              coffee, and a basket of
apples. We helped ourselves you may depend, as
though we hadn't had any thing to eat for a month.
The legislater-folks come back in crowds and
flocked
round the door, and a great many of 'em come
in and talked with us about
              the war down in our
disputed territory. They all said the land was
ourn,
              every inch of it, and we must stick to it, and
not give up a single tree; for
              the legislater was
determined to stand by us, and would vote to pay
all
              the expenses. After they'd all cleared out, we
laid down and took a nap. And
              about an hour
before sunrise I got up and looked out, and see
'twas all
              broad daylight; so I went and touched
Sargent Johnson, and told him 'twas time
              to be
stirring. He sprung on his feet quicker than if
he'd been shot, and
              says he, Where? where?
where be they? I'm ready for 'em. Give me my
gun! give me my sword! Stand by, boys, I'll go
ahead! Where be
              they?
And then he begun to rub his eyes, and looked
round and see me, and says he,
Oh, John, is it you? I believe I was dreaming.
I thought the enemy
              was jest a breaking into our
camp, and I was going to send daylight through
'em about the quickest. And then he looked out
of the window,
              and says he, By zounds! it's
morning; come, John, call'em up, and let us have
a bite of something to eat and be a going.
So I roused them all out, and we got some
breakfast, and got all ready to start
              a little before
sunrise. We found out where the governor
boarded, and
              Sargent Johnson said he meant to
give him a salute as we went by, if he
wasn't
up.
So when we got along against the house, he give
the word to fire, and we blazed away like a clap
of thunder. In a minute
              the governor come
running
to the window in his shirt sleeves, and he
opened the window and looked
              out, and says
he
That's you my brave fellers, you are the sort
for me. I never shall
              be afraid of the British
while I have sich fellow-soldiers as you are. Tell
Jarvis to stick to the old line; we'll have the line
of '83, come what
              will. And don't forget to tell
Jarvis to mind and
hold on to
                the logs
.
He wished us a speedy march, and shot down
the window, and we jogged along.
It's no use for me to try to tell you all about
the everlasting great long road
              we had to
go over to get down here; for there's more
mountains, and hills,
              and woods, and rivers,
and ponds, and brooks, and snow-banks, and
swamps, than you could shake a stick at for a
month. Our disputed territory is a
              terribly long
ways off, and there's no end to it when you get
there. We
              didn't stop to Houlton, for our orders
was to go right down into the midst of
              it, and
report
ourselves to Colonel Jarvis. So we inquired
the way along and found
              Colonel Jarvis and his
men was gone on to Fitzherbert's farm, down
close
              to the line, and was building up a fortification. We marched along till we come clear
in sight of the farm, and could see the men to
work.
Now, says Sargent Johnson, now, my boys,
is
              the time to show your best. See that your guns
are well loaded, and march up to
              the camp like
heroes.
We stopped and examined our guns to see if
they was well loaded, and as Billy
              Wiggins was
fumbling over his lock to see if the priming was
good, some
              how or other he let her go; and he
had a monstrous heavy charge in, and she
              roared
away through the woods like a harrycane. At
that, Sargent Johnson
              almost swore, and said he
wished Billy Wiggins had staid at home. But he
8*
told us to shoulder our guns and march up
quick-step
towards the camp. So we marched along,
and in a minute or two we see a
              terrible
mustering
round the camp. They come out as thick as
bees and begun to form into a
              line, and went to
loading their guns as fast as they could make their
hands fly. And a little, small, brisk man seemed
to be taking the command, and
              placing the men
this way and that, and making his bright sword
fly about
              like a streak of lightning. Sargent
Johnson told us to halt; for we begun to
              feel a
little blue all to once. We didn't know but we
had missed our road
              and got over the line, and
that night be a camp of the British. So Sargent
Johnson thought it was best to stop and
reconnoitre
a little.
Bime-by we see one chap from the camp
running towards the woods as hard as he
              could
spring.
'Tis the British, said Sargent Johnson,
'tis
              the British; and they are afraid of us; see
how that feller runs!
But in a minute we heard the brisk little man,
that had the command, bawl out
              after him to stop,
and he swung his sword round as if he'd take his
head off. The feller looked over his shoulder, but
kept along. At that the commander ketcht up a
gun and called again, and
              says he, If you don't
come right back, I'll put a ball through your
              heart
in a minute. That stopt the feller, and he come
back
              again and took his place in the ranks.
There's spunk there, said Sargent Johnson,
let
              'em belong to which side of the line they will.
If I knew they was British, we'd
              face 'em and give
'em battle at once. But I should hate to fire at
'em
              till we know, for fear they might belong to our
side.
We was a little staggered for a while to know
what was best to do. As near as
              we could see
what they was about at the camp, they was busy
to work
              getting ready to fight us. And as there
was only eleven of us, and there seemed
              to be
some hundreds of them, we thought it was best for
us to be on the
              look out, and see that they didn't
get the advantage of us. Sargent Johnson said
he didn't see how he could have missed the road,
and he couldn't hardly
              believe yet, but what they
belonged to our side. So says he
If there's any one of you that dares to go up
with a flag of truce,
              I think we better send up and
have a fair understanding with 'em before we
begin
to fight.
None of the rest of 'em started, so I told the
sargent I was the boy for him to
              send on that are
arrant. And says he
That's you, John, I knew before I spoke, you
was the man for it. So
              get ready.
But come to look round we couldn't find any
thing to make a flag of truce of;
              for Sargent
Johnson said it must be white, and we hadn't one
of us got a
              white handkerchief or any sich thing;
so we seemed to be kind of stuck. At last,
              says I,
You needn't bother about that. There's more
ways to
              kill a cat than one. So I tore off a
good large square piece of my
              shirt and tied it on
to the end of my gun, and says I
Sargent, I'm ready.'
After he told me what to say, I shouldered my
gun and marched up towards the
              camp with my
flag of truce flying. The camp stood up on a
rising ground
              about a quarter of a mile from our
company, and their soldiers was all out and
formed
in a line three or four deep. But I marched
right straight up to 'em; and
              when I got up
within
a few rods, the commanding officer come along
out with his sword in his hand and met me.
Says I
Who commands these troops?
Colonel Jarvis, says he.
I want to see him, says I.
I'm the man, says he.
Well, sir, says I, you are the very man
we've
              been looking for all day.
Well, sir, says he, I'm ready for you, let
you
              want what you will. But is Sir John Harvey
any where about here? If he is, you
              may go back
and tell him we don't want any of his flags of
truce, and no
              parleying about it; for we are
determined
to hold on to the land, every inch of it,
and the logs too, if we have to
              die in the last ditch,
and he may help himself if he can.
But, says I, my dear sir, you are mistaken;
we
              ain't Sir John Harvey's folks by a jug full. We
are the Smithville detatchment,
              under command
of Sargent Johnson, and have come down to jine
your
              forces.
Ah, ha! says the colonel, that alters the
case. So he run back and told his men how
'twas, and they set up
              three tremendous cheers
that made the woods ring again.
As soon as our company heard that, they come
running up the hill like a flock
              of sheep, and
Sargent
Johnson and the colonel was so glad to see
each other, that they shook
              hands so hard, I didn't
know but they would have pulled one another's
hands off. The colonel took us right into the
camp and give us some dinner, and
              said he was
most confounded glad we'd got along, for he'd
been
              expecting a brush with the British a number
of days.
We hain't had much chance to look about here
yet, but when we do, I'll write
              again. You
needn't be consarned about our giving up any of
our disputed
              territory, for our troops is all as fierce
as tigers about it, and Colonel
              Jarvis, though he's
a little, small, thin man, he's jest as smart as a
steel-trap.
Give my love to all the folks, and I remain your
loving son,
JOHN.Our Disputed Territory, pretty near the
Line
,
March
, 20, 1839.
Dear Father
Tell mother I ain't shot yet,
though we've had one pretty considerable of a
brush, and expect every day to
              have some more.
Colonel Jarvis has took quite a liking to our little
Smithville detachment. He says we are the
smartest troops he's got, and as long as we stick
by him, it isn't Sir John
              Harvey, nor all
New-Brumzick
,
nor even Queen
              Victory herself can
ever drive him off of Fitzherbert's farm. Perhaps
you
              mayn't remember much about this
Fitzherbert's
farm, where we are. It is the very place
where the British nabbed our Land
              Agent, Mr.
McIntire, when he was abed, and asleep, and
couldn't help
              himself, and carried him off to
Frederiction
jail. Let 'em come and try to nab us, if
they dare; if they wouldn't wish
              their cake was
dough again, I'm mistaken. We've got up pretty
considerable
              of a little kind of a fort here, and we
keep it manned day and
              nightwe don't more than
half of us sleep to once, and are determined
              the
British shall never ketch us with both eyes shet.
But I 'spose mother's in dreadful fidgets to know
about the brush, that I
              mentioned in the first part
of my letter, so I must make haste and get along
to it. It wasn't exactly a scratch with the
British soldiers, but
              something jest about as bad,
and I don't know but a little worse, for it was
              along
with them thieving trespassers, that's been cutting
down our trees,
              and stealin' our logs. And I think
9
I should as lives run my chance among soldiers as
among thieves.
That night arter we got here, when the sentries
was all placed round the fort,
              and the things all
put up for the night, Colonel Jarvis asked us to go
in
              and set down and have a chat. So we did; and
he asked us all about our march
              down here to our
disputed territory, and what the news was to home,
and if
              we see the governor as we come along, and
if he sent any word to him, and so on.
              Sargent
Johnson told him all about it, and told him the
governor was
              terrible arnest for him to
hold on to
the logs;
and said
              he mustn't never flinch a hair,
nor give up an inch of our disputed territory,
              let
what would come, and he must put a stop to their
cutting down our
              timber.
Colonel Jarvis said, the governor might let him
alone for that; if Sir John
              Harvey got hold of any
of them logs, he would have to get up airlier in the
morning than ever he did yet.
Now, Sargent Johnson, said the Colonel,
you
              are a smart officer, and you've got a smart
little company here; and bein'
              you've jest come
into the service, it wouldn't be no more than fair
that
              you should have a chance to take hold of some
kind of a job that should be an honour to you and
your company, and show to the people of the state
what sort of grit you
              are made of. I think it's
very likely there's some of them are thieving chaps
about here in the woods yet, cutting down our
timber; and you may take
              your men in the
morning
,
and load up your guns and
              go off on a cruise,
and see if you can ketch any of the rascals, and
bring
              'em and their teams off here prisoners of
war; and the rest of us 'll stay here
              and guard the
fort while you are gone. If the rascals set out to
fight,
              don't show 'em no quarter, but take 'em, dead
or alive, and bring 'em off to the
              fort.
Sargent Johnson told him, that was jest sich a
job as we should
              like, and we'd be out in the
morning
bright and airly and go at it.
Accordingly, as soon as it was daylight in the
morning, I turned out and gave
              Sargent Johnson
a touch, and told him 'twas time to be starting. He
was on
              his feet as quick as a wink, and told me to
call the men and tell them to get
              ready. In a few
minutes we got our breakfasts, and put some
dinner
in our knapsacks, and see that our guns was
all well loaded; and after the
              Colonel told us which
way we better go, we marched off, and struck right
into the woods.
We had rather tough getting about, pretty much
all the forenoon, scratching
              about through the
bushes, and climbing over logs and stones, and
working
              our way through the swamps; but
towards
noon we begun to come along into the
timber
land. And, my stars! sich great whapping
pine trees, as straight as a
              candle, and tall as a
liberty-pole, and standing all round as thick as the
bean-poles in our garden, I guess you never see.
Ah, says Sargent Johnson, this is the place
where them thieving chaps picks their
huckleberries
.
We shall get upon the track of some of 'em
bime-by!
At last we come to a pretty considerable of a kind
of a little river. Sargent
              Johnson told us to keep
a sharp look out now, for they hauled the logs into
these small rivers and brooks, and in the spring, when
the ice broke up,
              they would shoot 'em along out
into the Aroostook river, and then scoot 'em away
off down the St. John's river, and carry 'em off to
England, and nobody
              knows where. We followed
the river up a mile or two, and I was away a little
ways ahead of the rest, and at last I heard a sharp
kind of a click, like the sound of an axe chopping
wood. I listened a spell, and then I heard it again;
and I told Sargent
              Johnson we was close upon 'em,
for I could hear 'em chop. At that we all stopped
and listened, and we could hear 'em as plain as
day. Sargent Johnson then
              told us to see that the
primin' in our guns was all right, and to foller him
as still as mice. So we crept along as careful as
if we was going on eggs.
              Bime-by we got on to a
little piece of rising ground, where we could look
down towards the bend of the river, and there we
see 'em as busy at work as a
              thief in a mill. They
had a little log cabin for themselves, and another
one for their oxen; and one chap was jest driving
the oxen in, to give 'em some
              hay, and the rest was
going in to dinner; all but the one that we heard
chopping; and he was digging his axe into the side
of a great large pine tree,
              as big round as a
hogset
.
Bime-by one of 'em come to
              the door and
hollered to him, and told him to come into dinner,
for the
              beans was all turned out, and growin' cold.
But he said the beans might go to
              pot for what he
keered, for he wouldn't come in till he got his tree
down,
              any how. So he kept his axe a going, click,
click, and we kept still and looked
              on. We see
9*
the tree was pretty nigh off; and bime-by we heard
a crack, and then a
              little louder crack; and we
looked up, and see the top begun to lean and
tremble
a littleit was a monstrous great big tree
and then
              the cracks come quicker and louder;
crack, crack, double crack, and the old tree
              begun
to whisk through among the tops of the other trees
with a roaring
              sound like a harrycane, and then, in
two winks of a hum-bird's eye, it went
              crash on
to the ground like a clap of thunder, and made all
smoke again.
By king, said Sargent Johnson, if that's the
way they steal our timber, I think it's a caution.
After the tree was down, the chap stuck his axe
into the stump, jest as when
              any body's a readin'
he puts his finger on where he left off, and then he
went into the camp to dinner.
Now, says Sargent Johnson, now's the time;
while they are at dinner we'll surround the camp,
and take 'em by
              surprise.
We looked down on to the bank of the river, and
we see two or three everlastin'
              great piles of logs,
as big as two or three houses, that they had cut,
and
              hauled, and rolled down the bank. This made
some of our company feel a little
              blue, for fear they
might be too many for us; and they asked
Sargent
Johnson if we hadn't better wait till they come
out of the camp, so we
              could see how many there
was of 'em. For there was only eleven of us, and
by the great pile of logs they had hauled down to
the river, there might be a
              hundred of them.
Sargent Johnson said he didn't care if there was
five hundred; he'd surround
              their camp and take
'em prisoners. And says he,
If any of you is cowards, you may turn about
and go back now, and
              them that stays will have
the honour all to ourselves.
At that they coloured up some, and said they was
no cowards, but was ready to
              go as fur as
he
would.
So Sargent Johnson then give us off the plan of
the campaign. And says
              he
You see there is a door to the cabin, and it
stands a little ways
              open; and you see there's
holes cut out through two sides of the cabin for
windows. Now we must creep as still as
midnight
,
so
              that they shan't see us nor hear us, and
when we've surrounded the cabin, I'll
              give a little
bit of a low whistle, and in a moment, two of you
must poke
              your guns right into them windows, and
I'll step right into the middle of the door with my
sword in one hand and my gun in 'tother, and two
more of you must spring
              right behind me and poke
your guns in over my shoulders, one over my right
shoulder and 'tother over my left shoulder; and
the rest of you must stand off,
              all ready to fire,
about two rods from the camp, as a core deserve.
Colonel Jarvis says it's always best to keep a core
deserve, when you are goin'
              to make an attack.
And as soon as I've got in the middle of the door,
and
              staring of 'em right in the face, I'll sing out
to 'em like
              thunder`Now you rascally stealin'
chaps, now I've got you; now if you
              don't give up
in a minute, we'll shoot you down like squirrels.'
And I
              guess that'll fetch 'em tu. If it don't, and
they set out to fight, why then we
              must fight,
that's all; and that's what we come down for.
After Sargent Johnson had given us our orders,
we told him we understood 'em,
              and would stick
to him through thick and thin. So we crawled
along towards
              the camp as fast and as still as we
could. We had to climb right over that
              thunderin'
great big tree that they jest fell, because it was
sich a bad
              place to get round ary end of it. But
at last we got along up within three or
              four rods
of the camp and Sargent Johnson made a sign for
us to halt, so we might all get ready; and come to
look round, one was
              missing, for there wasn't but
ten of us. And come to look round to see who it
was, it was Billy Wiggins. Sargent Johnson
looked cross enough, and a
              little surprised too;
for he said, for all Billy was sich a fumbling,
clumsy little chap, he never thought he was a
coward. At that I looked back the
              way we come,
and I see Billy's head bobbing up and down
behind
that great pine tree, as he was jumping up
with all his might and trying
              to climb up on to it.
I see in a minute what the difficulty was; he
couldn't get up on to the tree, and he didn't dare
to holler, for that would
              muster 'em out of the
cabin. So I run back and jumped up on to the
tree
              and got hold of Billy's hand and hauled him
over. And we pretty soon got all
              ready to make
the attack. Every man had his gun pinted
towards
the cabin and all ready to pull. I and
Jonathan
Downing was to stand behind Sargent
Johnson
and pint our guns over his shoulders; and Seth
Josslyn was to stand to one
              window and Billy
Wiggins to 'tother. As soon as we was all ready,
Sargent
              Johnson give a little, easy whistle, and
we all sprung to our places; but before Sargent
Johnson had time to begin to speak, Billy
Wiggins's
gunI guess there must be something the
matter with Billy's
              forefinger, for his gun blazed
away like lightning into the cabin window, and
              his
ball went splash right into a log on 'tother side. And
all in the same
              breath the rest of our guns was all
pokin' in on every side, and Sargent Johnson
              was
bawling out to 'em with his roaring voice and
calling
of'em stealin' rascals. Oh, father! I wish
you'd
              been there. If you ever see a flock of mice
in the buttery nibbling round a pan
              of meal, and
see the old cat jump right into the window and
land right
              down in the middle on 'em, and see how
them mice
went it
,
              you might guess a little how
them prisoners of ourn jumped and sprung round
and screamed. As I was looking right in over
Sargent Johnson's shoulder, I
              could see the whole
on't. There was six of 'em, and they was all
setting
round the table eating their dinners. They
had a great large milk-pan in
              the middle of the
table full of baked beans and three or four pounds
of
              fat pork on the top of it; and a kettle of soup
on one end of the table, and
              bread and potatoes
and so on, all over the table. And when the
thunder-clap broke upon 'em all to once, they all
sprung right up as if they'd gone out of their
skins; and the table went like a
              lock of hay in a
whirlwind. It bounced up in the first place
almost
to the roof of the cabin; and when it
came down, the beans flew from one
              side of
the room to the other, like shot in a
pepper-box
;
and the soup-kettle and the bread and the
dishes and
              the potatoes I couldn't keep the run of.
After the first scream was over, and they see
they wasn't killed, one of 'em
              sprung and
ketched
a handspike that they had to stir the fire
with, and another ketched up a
              stool that they
had to set on, and another run behind the door
and brought
              out an old gun. But when they
see our guns pokin' in round so thick, they
sprung into the corners and squat down behind
the barrels, and begun to holler
              don't fire!
don't fire! At last after they begun to get
still a little, so he could be heard, Sargent
Johnson
told 'em to lay down their arms. At that,
one laid down his handspike,
              t'other one his gun,
and things begun to get considerable quiet.
Then Sargent Johnson asked 'em if they was
willing to surrender themselves prisoners of war.
At that, one of 'em that seemed to be the head
man among 'em, a short,
              thick, fat man, with a
red face and a blueish nose, stepped forward and
asked Sargent Johnson what he wanted. The
sargent told him they must deliver
              themselves
up as prisoners of war and be carried to the
American camp.
And then what is to be done with us? said
he.
Well, then, you'll have to be sent to Bangor,
to be tried for
              stealing the logs on our disputed
territory, said Sargent Johnson.
Well, then, we'll die first, said he, and he sprung
back
              and ketched up the gun. But when he
looked
round and see the rest of his men was as white
as a cloth and quivering
              behind the barrels, and
see our guns all pinted right at him, he see 'twas
no use. And says he, Captain don't fire, I'll
give up. And
              he brought his gun and give it to
Sargent Johnson. Then Sargent Johnson
ordered
'em to come out two by two, and we took and
tied them together by twos, so
              we could guard 'em
easy; and then we went to the hovel and took out
the oxen. There was two yoke of oxen and a
hoss; and we yoked 'em up and loaded all the
provisions they had in the camp and
              started off
for our fort. Jonathan Downing drove the oxen;
and Billy
              WigginsSargent Johnson said Billy
was sich an unlucky kind of a
              feller he had no
patience with him; but after all, he said he didn't
know
              but what his gun goin' off so, did about as
much good as any thingso
              on the whole, bein'
he had sich short legs, he said Billy Wiggins
should
              ride the hoss.
So when we all got ready, we marched off
towards
our fort, and got back jest about sunset.
And as we was coming up the hill
              towards the fort,
they all come out to meet us and give us a salute.
I
              guess you never see a man more tickled than
Colonel Jarvis was. He hopped up and
              down and
slapped Sargent Johnson on the shoulder more
than forty times;
              and declared if the oxen was
only fat enough, we'd have one of 'em roasted
whole the next day for dinner.
But I can't say any more to-day; so give my
love to the folks, and I remain
              your loving son,
JOHN.Our Disputed Territory pretty near the Line, on
Fitzherbert's farm
,
March
25, 1839.
Dear Father
We stick by here yet, takin' care
of our disputed territory and the logs; and while
we stay here the British will
              have to walk as
straight as a hair, you may depend. We ain't had
much fighting to do since my last letter; and some
how or other, things
              seem to be getting cooler
down here a little, so that I'm afraid we ain't agoing
to have the real scratch, after all, that I wanted to
have. A day or two
              arter we took the logging
camp and brought the men and oxen off here
prisoners
of war, we was setting in the fort after
dinner
and talking matters over, and Sargent
Johnson
was a wondering what a plague was the
reason
the British didn't come up to the scratch as
they talked on. He said he
              guessed they wasn't
sich mighty fairce fellers for war as they
pretended
to be, arter all.
Well, said Colonel Jarvis, I got some
despatches
from Governor Fairfield this morning,
that says Sir John Harvey seems to
              be a little
inclined to haul in his horns; and I don't believe
they'll try
              to drive us out of our disputed
territory
,
or come
              a near us. But still the
governor
says we must hold on and look out sharp,
for he don't know how 'twill turn
              out yet; and
we must keep possession of the territory, and
not let any
              body come into it, nor any logs go
out of it, till we have further
              orders.
10*
Well, says Sargent Johnson, I don't like
this
              staying about here doing nothing; I ain't used
to it. If them British are any
              notion of coming
here and having a tug with us, I wish they'd
come and
              have it over. Why don't we go clear
to the line, colonel? How do we know but
              what
they'll get over this side on't sometimes, if we
ain't there to see
              to it? And besides, I want to
see
that boundary line, that I've heard so much tell
of; and I'm determined to
              see it before I go
home, if I have to march down to it all alone;
so I can
              have it to tell my children of, when I
get to be an old man, and can say to 'em,
              I
have seen the boundary line myself, and
marched
clear down to it and stood on it.
Here I couldn't help putting in a word tu;
and says I
So do I, colonel, I want to see that are
boundary line, and go right
              up to it, and
toe the
mark;
I never was dared to toe the
              mark yet,
but what I did it, let who would stand t'other
side. And I
              should like to go right up to this
line, and put my toes on to it, and look over
              on
to the British side, and stump them to come up to
it if they
              dared.
At that Colonel Jarvis turned round and
looked
at me, and haw-hawed right out; and, says he
Well done, John, you are growing quite
wolfy. I like your spunk any
              how; but you are
young and inexperienced, and don't understand
all the
              turns of the game exactly. You hain't
seen so much war as your old great
              grandfather
has; you must try to keep cool and foller your
officers.
But, colonel, says I, do you know
grandfather
?
Yes, I do, says he; I have heard him tell
his
              war stories many a time. Didn't he give you
no good advice when you come
              away?
Nothing, says I; only he charged me not
to be
              in too much of a hurry to fire.
Well, says the colonel, you'd better
remember
that advice, and foller it. And it's a pity
Billy Wiggins hadn't a
              grandfather to advise
him.
At that Billy Wiggins rolled up his little gray
eyes at the colonel, and fairly
              looked red; and
says Billy, says he
Well, colonel, my gun goes too easy, and I
can't help it. I've been
              a squirrel hunting with it
so much, it'll almost go off itself, before you
              think
on't.
But this ain't what we was talking about,
said Sargent
              Johnson; and I don't see as it
brings us any nearer the line. As I
              said afore,
colonel, I don't like this staying about here and
doing
              nothing; and if things are getting cooled
down a little, so as like as not we
              shall have to go
off home pretty soon, I think the sooner we take
a peep
              at that boundary line the better.
The colonel said, the boundary line wasn't but a
few miles off, and we was as
              near to it now as
'twas prudent to have our head-quarters. We'd
got a good
              strong place here on Fitzherbert's farm
for a fort, and we must stick by it and
              keep it well
manned and guarded. And he said, bein'
Sargent
Johnson and his company was so good on a
scouting-party, and did so well
              t'other day when
we took the logging camp, he didn't keer if we
tried it
              again the next day. We might go out
and scour round awhile, and see if we could
              find
any more trespassers, and go down as far as the
line if we'd a mind
              to; only be careful and not get
over on t'other side of the line; for if the
              British
nabb'd us there, we should be lawful game, and it
would be hard work to make 'em give us up.
So we was all alive in a minute, fitting out for
a new campaign. We went to
              work and rubbed
up our guns, and put new flints into 'em, and got
'em so
              they'd go as quick as a stream of lightning.
And the next morning we was up by
              times and
got our breakfasts, and filled our knapsacks, and
started off.
              We hunted round most all the
forenoon
to find some more trespassers, but we
couldn't find hide nor hair of a
              single one. We
thought we must be pretty near the line, and
sometimes we
              begun to feel a little skittish for
fear we might get acrost and not know it,
              and the
British might hop up behind some of the old logs
and trees and nab
              us before we could have time to
take aim at 'em. Bime-by Billy Wiggins started
on ahead of us and run like a two-year-old, up on
to a little hill there
              was a little ways ahead; and
then he begun to climb a slim, tall pine tree, and
he hitched and scrabbled up as fast as a young
bear.
What upon earth, said Sargent Johnson,
is
              Billy arter now?
A squirrel, I guess, said I; I'll bet a
potato
,
Billy has treed a squirrel.
When we got along up a little nearer, Sargent
Johnson called out to him to know
              what he was
doing up there.
I'm jest a looking off here to see if
I can see
the line
, said Billy, stretching his neck away to
the
              eastward, and looking with all the eyes in his
head.
Well, do you see it? said Sargent Johnson.
See it? no; said Billy, I don't see nothing
but woods, and woods, as fur as I can see.
Sargent Johnson told him he guessed he would
see it quicker if he was down on
              the ground, than
he would up there. So Billy come down again,
and we
              jogged along. Bime-by we come to a tree
that had some old marks and spots on two
              sides
of it. And we looked along north and south of
this tree, for Sargent
              Johnson said the line runs
due north from the monument, and we found some
more trees marked and spotted jest like it.
Ah, says Sargent Johnson, we've found it.
This
              is the boundary line we've heard so much tell
of; we've got it at last. Now look
              and see if you
can see the British on t'other side of it; and let
every man hold on to his gun and be ready to fire
if I say the word.
We looked across the line, and looked and
looked
,
but we couldn't see nothin' but trees, and
bushes, and woods, and swamps. We
              hollered
across the line as hard as we could holler, to see
if we could
              raise any of the British, for we all felt
as if we wanted to have a brush. And
              we thought
at first they answered us; but when we come to
holler again, we
              found it was only the echo of our
own voices, that come back from the hills a
              little
ways off. So we marched along on the line two
or three miles, but
              we couldn't see nor hear
nothin'
of nobody. At last we sot down and got the
victuals out of our knapsacks
              and eat our dinners,
and rested awhile. When we got ready to start
again
              to go back to our fort, Sargent Johnson said
we should give the British one
              broadside before
we left 'em, jest to let 'em know what the Yankee
boys
              are made of. So he told us to see that our
guns was all right; and then he
              ordered us to
stand up all in a row, and
toe the line
,
              facing to the
British side; and then he give us off the word
Make ready, take aimfire.
There, says Sargent Johnson, now I can
go home contented, war or no war; for we've
poured one good grist into their own territory, and
they may help themselves if
              they can.
Then we put on our knapsacks and shouldered
our guns and started back towards
              the fort. We
fit our way along through the bushes and swamps
two or three
              miles, till we come out a little more
into the upland, and as we was walking
              along and
talking and telling how we guessed the British
wouldn't dare to
              come up and toe the line as we
had done, all at once we come across a great
              track
in the snow. We stopped and looked at it awhile,
but we couldn't
              tell what sort of a track it was.
Some guessed it was a bear, and some guessed
              it
was an ox, and some guessed it was a hoss, but
they all said it didn't
              look like nary one on 'em.
At last Billy Wiggins said, he didn't believe but
what it was the
British Lion
got over on to our
side of the boundary line. At that we all had a
good laugh, and Sargent Johnson
              said, if that was
the case we'd have a hunt for him, for no British
lion
              had a right to set his foot in our disputed
territory. So we turned off and
              followed the
track. Bime-by we looked away ahead a little
ways amongst the
              trees, and there we see it.
'Twas a great crittur, that looked some like an
ox, only 'twas about as tall and long as a hoss;
and he had a great mess
              of horns sprangling out
both sides of his head like a great bunch of dry
hemlock knots.
There, says Billy Wiggins, didn't I tell
you
              it was the British lion? Don't you see his
horns?
But, tain't the lion that has horns, it's the
unicorn that has
              horns, according to my book,
said Jonathan Downing; and I
              guess it's a
unicorn
.
No, says I, tain't a unicorn; unicorns don't
have but one horn, and this feller's got a dozen.
He stood with his head up, eating the bark off
the limbs of the trees. And as
              soon as Sargent
Johnson got up so near he could have a fair sight
of him,
              he sung out, it's a mooseit's a moose;
now we'll have some
              fun; now for a moose
chase.
As soon as the moose see us, he jumped his
whole length, and started to run. He
              threw his
head back on his shoulders, and tipped it one side,
so as to
              bring one bunch of his horns over his back,
while 'tother bunch pinted forward,
              so he could run
11
between the trees and bushes; and he jumped and
run like a young ox, and
              we arter him, as tight as
we could spring. We couldn't fire at first, for we
had forgot to load our guns again arter firing our
broadside on the line;
              and Sargent Johnson said
it was no matter about stopping to load, for if we
could get him in a good stout snow-bank, we could
take him alive. So we
              pulled foot arter him as
hard as we could go. Some of the way the snow
was
              pretty deep, and so hard we could run on the
top of it. But the moose broke
              through almost
every step, and he had sich hard work jumping
and
              floundering along, he couldn't gain ahead of
us hardly a bit. At last he got
              kind of wedged up
between some high rocks on one side, and some
old trees
              that was blowed down on 'tother side,
and there he was in as bad a fix as Billy
              Wiggins
was, behind the great pine log that I told you about
in my last
              letter. There was no chance for the
poor moose to get away, but to turn right
              back and
make his way right through among us. He looked
round at us, and
              shook his head a few times, and
bime-by he turned round and fetched a spring and
come right at us, full chisel. We sprung, some
one way and some 'tother,
              and give him a chance
to go by, and Jonathan Downing fetched him a lick
acrost his nose with his gun, and broke his gun
stock. But poor Billy
              Wiggins couldn't spring
out of the way so quick as the rest of us, and the
moose run right against him, and knocked him
head-over-heels, as much as a rod,
              and the next
jump he stepped on to one of Billy's legs, and
broke it off
              as short as a pipe-stem. We run and
helped Billy up, and found he wasn't hurt
              much,
only his leg was broke; so Sargent Johnson told
one of the men to
              stay by him, and we took arter
the moose agin. Arter we chased him about half
a mile further, he got into sich a deep snow-bank,
it stopped him. He
              jumped and floundered round,
but he couldn't get out, and only got deeper and
deeper into it, till at last he was all covered in the
snow-bank, but his
              head and horns, and there he
stuck, pretty well tired out. We walked right up
to him. His eyes looked as wild as if he'd eat us
up; but he couldn't help
              himself. We took some
strong lines that we had with us, and tied 'em to
his horns, on both sides of his head, and took a
slip-nuse round his nose, and
              trod the snow down,
and got him out of the bank. We found, by
trying
him round a little, that we could manage him
so as to lead him and drive him to the fort alive.
So we sent two hands back to bring Billy Wiggins
up; and they brought him
              along, and we took and
sot him a straddle of the moose, and told him to
hold on to the horns. Then Sargent Johnson took
command of the ropes on one
              side, and I on 'tother,
and each of us took a hand to help us hold on, and
Jonathan Downing took hold of the line that had
the slip-nuse round the nose,
              and went ahead to
pick out the best path; and the other five went
behind
              with sticks and whipped up. When we
got all fixed, we started off and made
              pretty good
headway. Poor Billy Wiggins begun to cry some,
and said he
              would never get home, now his leg was
broke; but Sargent Johnson comforted him
              up,
and told him to never mind, for if he hadn't his
leg broke,
              he might never have had a chance to
ride home to the fort in triumph on the
              British
lion. At that Billy laughed, and seemed to be in
pretty
              good spirits the rest of the way. We'd got
out pretty near the fort before we'd
              ketched the
moose, and a little before sunset we got out into
the opening,
              and was marching up the hill towards
the fort.
When we got pretty near, Colonel Jarvis come
running to meet us, and says he,
Sargent Johnson, what sort of a prisoner have
you got
              here?
Why, this is the British lion, said Sargent
Johnson;
              we took him this side of the line, and,
therefore, he's fairly our
              prisoner.
You are the boys for me, said the Colonel;
and he went
              back and told the men, and they give
three the loudest cheers for Sargent
              Johnson's
company that ever I heard. The Colonel had
supper for us in a
              few minutes, and took Billy
Wiggins into the hospital, and had his wounds
dressed, and he bids fair to do well; and took the
moose and tied him in the
              barn. Colonel Jarvis
says we must keep him alive, and carry him home
as a
              grand trophy of the war.
P. S.I want mother to send me down two pair
of stockings and a pair
              of trousers, for we've got 'em
torn out terribly down here among the bushes. So
I remain your loving son,
JOHN.
