One
year; one whole year hath passed away, since I
finished the last chapter. This very evening
completes
it. And even yet, my hand trembles, in taking
up the story again. I feel like one, who, having grown
old in sorrow and loneliness, is about to enter again, for
the first time, since the death of a beloved one,the
apartment
where she died
.How shall I bear it?Is
there, do you believe, upon the wide earth, a man of
my age, so utterly desolate, as I, at this moment? I do
not believe that there is. I have loved, and been
beloved
,
truly and tenderly; very passionately too; and
devoutly, at times;been blessed, beyond the lot of other
menwith the wife of my heart, and the babe of my
strength, beautiful as day, and good, as beautifulbut
where are they? Man, man! of what avail is all thy
sorrowing and humiliation!thy penitence and
contrition
?
The curse of thy boyhood pursues thee! the
shadow
of thy transgressions; and, where the good man
beholds but the visiting of God's own hand, in
gentleness
and love, the wicked quake under it, as beneath
the unsparing retribution of one, that hath power, and
will not be appeased.
Merciful Father! do thou sustain us. Wean our
young hearts, at an early hour, we pray thee, from all
that the affections cling to, so desperately;for, O, it
is
awful, to be widowed in our old age,to nurse our
children, into beauty and blossom, and see them lie dead
before us!to watch, many and many a night, by our
dear one,and yet outlive her! to see her sweet eyes
quenched;her lips turned to stone, and her smooth,
living hair, deadutterly deadand harsh to the
distracted
pressure of our mouth!
One whole year!and even yet, I am dreading to
touch the canvass again. It is coming, too,
immediately
,
in contact with mortality. It isO, I know not
what; but I would avoid itand will.
Can
you have
the heart to forbid my wandering awhile. May I not
tell the tale, without name?---one name, at least---in
my bereavement?
Well, well---after that---I was very sick for a long
while; I was at home, when I came to myself---not at
the home where I was born; but Elizabeth was with
me, and that made the place a
home
, to me:---and, when
I came entirely to my strength, I believe that my
character
was greatly altered. I was less imperious of
manner; and, perhaps, more humble and lowly of
spirit
.
Elizabeth was constantly with me; and her sweet,
unaffected piety wore upon me, before I knew it. And
Hammond too; he knelt down at my bed side; and there
was something of a grander character in
his
worship.
His was emphatically religionhers, piety. He
visited
us continually; and, it was a long time, before I
rightly
understood on what footing. My sister had
determined
not to marry;and when I looked into her
beautiful
heart, and saw all its harmonious proportion;
at her delicate frame, so exquisitely wrought;and
thought of her affectionate temper and vivid genius, I
could not but believe, that she had done wisely. Where
was the man worthy of her, who might
not
, if he were
great enough to deserve her, in some moment of
perilous
enterprize, put himself at hazard, in a contention
with some spectre of glory!---and that, I knew, would
kill her;or, if he were only, like herself, some one of
patient bearing, in life, to whom the sweet ministering
of woman was potent, as the incantation of them that
make the very fountains of the earth boil up---the ocean
rumble---the fire and lava beat through their secret
channels, like blood in the arteries of men---how would
she wear away her life with him, ambitions as she was?
---in solitude?---darkness? and silence? O, no---that
were an idle and unworthy death.
No---there was no choice left; and, when I had her
near to me, it was strangely delightful to think of her,
as of one, that was to be mine, and mine alone, for ever
and ever! I would catch her to my heart, and kiss
her, till the blood was ready to burst through her pale
forehead.
At last, I had the strength to speak of what had
passed---to go to the grave of---ofyes. I will write
it,---of
Caroline;
---and to pluck up a few blades of the
scented grass, that grew there. It was a wintry and
desolate spot. The sea beach was near; and, at the
spring tide, her grave was drenched with salt spray;
yet, the flowers
would
spring up; and the sweet violet,
would
watch an opportunity, and peep out, for a
moment
,
at the peril of being torn away by the watching
blast. I went to the cottage. That too was desolate.
The father was in his grave. Of a broken heart, he had
died, if ever an old man died of one, in this world. I
saw his wife again---she, who had well nigh been my
mother. Her heart cried out wildly---at the sight of
me;---and she fell upon my neck, and there, even
there
,
I vowed inwardly, never to part with her more;---and I
never did---but she left me---for the only place that she
was fitted for; the society of the just, made perfect.---
Yes---of a broken heart, the old man died. His last
hope was a law suit. Again and again, had he
expected
a favourable issue; any issue, indeed, would have been
less fatal to him. At last, the day of trial came---but
it went by. Another came---his counsel were ready,
and the old man's heart beat high, with the hope of
dying less abject, by a very little, than he had once
apprehended
.
He was ready; agitated; and moved even
to tears; his witnesses with him. But---there was some
formality; some unknown privilege; to the other party,
that could not be explained to him,---which prevented
the trial again.---He could not understand it. It was
the death blow to his confidence in man. The lawyers
had drained him of his last dollar---under one pretence
and another;---and now---it was just what his wife had
long foretold him, there was to be no return to
him
, of
the money that had gone, whatever happened; and then,
in the imbecility of his piteously shattered
understanding
,
he began to view it as a judgment upon him; for
even so had it been called by the
Society
, for having
set their laws at naught, and gone,
unwarily
, into
litigation
.
He came home, said Eunice. I met him at the
door. That night, he never opened his mouth. I
dreaded to mention the name of business to him. I
did'nt ask him one word, about the law suit; but I
feared
the worst! He took to his bed. He never held up
his head, againhe never spoke a word, after the first
greeting to me, when he entered the door; and, in three
days, we buried him.
Can this be righteous? said I. Speak to me,
Hammond. You are a lawyer. Is it not a cruel and
hard hearted profession? Do ye not profit of misery
and crime?
We do. But do not physicians and surgeons.
Would you destroy them, too? I believe that a
litigous spirit grows out of ignorance, rather than
knowledge. But this poor man owed his death, not to
the lawyers, but to the law.
How?
Under a sense, and a mistaken one, of moral
obligation
,
was the reply.
I do not understand you. Do you speak of his debts?
Yes. He thought them all paid; but they were not;
are not, to this hour. Dormant claims were
constantly
arising; and creditors, who had no legal right to
molest him, fastened, like blood hounds upon his
conscience
;
and tore and lacerated his old heart, as if it
were a pleasant thing to torture one, that had been so
powerful. I had more than one conversation with him,
before his death; and, had he been as sound of
understanding
then, as he was once, I could have lightened his
heart, entirely, of the chief oppression that it felt.
What was it?
He laboured under a sense of moral obligation, that
crushed him. He had persuaded himself, that,
although
set free by the law, he was morally bound to
pay every man whom he owedthat he might sleep
quietly
in his grave.
vol. ii. A 2
I pray you, Hammond; remember that I am not a
lawyer. I do not understand your legal subtleties;
your artificial reasoning. But I ask you a plain
question
.
Is it your belief, that a man may be discharged
from the
moral
obligation of a debt, under any
circumstances
,
until it be
paid
?
I answer you, William, plainly,
no
. The
debt
must
be
paid;
the
contract performed
, or there is for ever a
moral
obligation remaining. But we are arguing too
abstractly. Let us take a familiar case, one that will
bring the question to an immediate issue. You have
an insolvent law in this state. A man contracts under
it to pay another, a sum of money. He becomes
insolvent
;
is discharged, in due course of law. Now, you
would ask, if he be not under a
moral
obligation to pay
that debt, whenever he is able.
Preciselythat is just what I mean.
I answer
no
. I say that he is
not
. You appear
surprised
.
If the law were in existence, at the time when the
contract was entered into; and he had been discharged
under that same law, then there is no
moral
obligation
left upon him.
But suppose that the law was
not
in existence, when
the contract was entered into; yet, that, before it was
completed, a law had been passed, and the debtor, duly
discharged under it; then there
is
a moral obligation
remaining.
I do not rightly comprehend you, Hammond.Do
you mean to say, that the
law
has any thing to do with
this
moral
obligation? They are two different things,
are they not?
legal
and
moral
obligations?
To answer you that question, intelligibly. I must
ask you, what the nature of a contract in this state, is,
under the insolvent law. Suppose that A contracts with
B, to pay him one thousand dollars, in sixty daysis A
to pay him
absolutely
, come what will?
Certainlythere can be no doubt of it.
You are hasty, my friend. These are questions
not to be so readily decided.
Is A
to pay, in case of
his
death
?
Certainly; if he leave sufficient property for the
purpose
.
`Very well. Then you, yourself, have already made
a qualified contract of what, in terms, is an
absolute
one.
By your own admission, the agreement is no longer,
to pay one thousand dollars in sixty days, happen what
will; but to pay that sum, in that time,
unless
he die;
and then, if there should be property enough.
Reflect
,
a moment. Where do you find that law? It
exists
no where. It is only a matter of rational
construction
;
any other doctrine would leave the conscience, of
an honest man, burdened
for ever
, in the next world, as
well as in this, with his unpaid debts.
Now, what is the true contract in your state of
Maryland
,
when a man enters into one like this. Is it to pay one
thousand dollars, at all events? No. What is it? It
is to pay one thousand dollars,
if he can
when he can
or
, produce a discharge under the insolvent law;
leaving certain of his subsequent acquisitions liable for
the debt;
provided
that the creditor shall take the
proper
,
legal steps, in season, to establish his claim.
That is the real contract, is it not?
No. It is not. Judge Marshall has declared that
the law is unconstitutional; and that, therefore, it
cannot
be made a part of the contract.
In the first place, my dear friend, to speak
reverently
of that decision, as becomes
me
it is a series of
blundering, from beginning to end. In the next place
I do not doubt that a state insolvent law
is
constitutional
;
and, in the third place. I do maintain, in defiance
of all that the supreme court have chosen to say
then
, in
their folly; and since, in confirmation of it, that, even
if the state law were
not
constitutional, it would still
make a part of all contracts entered into under it.
[1]
[1]
An argument, of which the above is the substance, was written
by a friend of mine, and published in the
Baltimore Telegraph
, the
moment that Judge Marshall's decision was known in that city; and
before it had been published or reported. It was, in fact, a severe
but very just criticism, on that unaccountable judgment; and was
received
by the mob of lawyers, just as the writer might have
expected
;and
just as natural reason always will be received, by men,
who, like the followers of Aristotlein all matters, whether of law,
religion, or metaphysicks, combat with
words
, rather than
ideas
it was received as a very presumptuous, and impertinent affair.
Yet I have lived to hear a
part
of the same doctrines, publickly and
privately maintained by William Pinkney, himself(
since the
criticism
appeared in the papers;
) and a part
sustained
in the New York
Courts, by the same process of reasoning;a part
repeated
in the
report
of Judge Marshall's decision, which had not been published,
when my friend wrote his criticism; and he had neither heard the
argument, nor received any intimation, whatever, of its nature; and
not only that, but I have lived to hear all that remained of Judge
Marshall's celebrated opinion in that case, justified, by a declaration
from one of the bench; that they were influenced, in going all
lengths, at the timethe Judges of the Supreme Court of the
United
States!by a hope of forcing Congress to pass a national
bankrupt
law; and that, having found the project to be a vain one, they
are now continually seeking to evade, and escape from, their own
decision, by every legal subtlety, refinement and pretence. Be it so:
but it would be more manful, to my notion, if they would reconsider
their judgment; acknowledge their transgression; and repent, like
men
, and like Judges; and not sneak out of the
consequences
of their
own solemn opinionwhile the opinion, itself, stands, on record
against
them, an everlasting reproach, to their wisdom and honesty.
But Judge Marshall says no. First, he says, that
it makes no difference at all, whether the law be
anterior
,
or subsequent to the contract.
There never was a more mischievous doctrine: and,
I believe, never a more untenable one. The law
passed
after
the contract, could, by no possibility, have been
in the contemplation of the parties, at the time when
the contract was entered into. But that, which was
passed
before, might
have been.
That
cannot be
denied
.
Now, it will be only necessary to show that it
was
;
and Judge Marshall, himself, would admit that it would
make a part of the contract.
It will not be denied by any man in his right senses,
that A, in the case named, might have
stipulated expressly
,
instead of promising as he did, to pay
absolutely
that
he would pay one thousand dollars, in such a time;
or
produce
a discharge:that is, it will not be denied that, the
law, as it stands, whether constitutional or not, might
have been incorporated into the contract, itself, by
writing
;
and that,
then
it would have made a part of it.
Suppose that it had. Would there have been any
moral
obligation in A, to pay the debt, after he was
discharged
,
except
out of certain subsequent acquisitions;
named in the certificate of discharge.No. All that an
honest man can be called upon to do;
all
, that his
conscience
requires of him to do, is, what he
contracted
to
do. What is the contract here. It is in the
alternative
.
It is not to
pay
absolutely; but to pay, or to
do
something
else; of course, if he
do
that something else, he is
released
from
payment
. It is just as if one should agree
to pay a thousand dollars,
or
make a conveyance, at a
certain time; and there would be just as much of a
moral
obligation in the latter case, to
pay
, after he had
made the conveyance, as in the former, to pay after he
was
discharged
.
Yesbut that, lawyer Hammond, you will admit,
would depend upon a
written
contract, into which the
law itself, was formally and substantially, if not
literally
incorporated
And beside said Elizabeth.
Hush! one at a time, if you please, said Hammond,
very
earnestly, but smiling. I shall now attempt to
show you, that it would make no difference, whether the
law be written or implied; whether it be expressed, or
understood, in the contract; if it be the usage, and the
belief of the tradethe common law; or the
lex loci
.
It is now too late to introduce the statute law into all
our contracts. People are obliged to know the law.
Not when it is
not
law; when it is
not
constitutional
,
I suppose, said Elizabeth, pleasantly.
Understand me. It would be lawful, undeniably,
for two individuals to incorporate this unconstitutional
law, into their contract. Now, if you can make it
appear
,
that the law was understood and meant by them, to
be a part of the contract at the time, just as if it were
inserted, word for word, in black and white; the law,
or rather equity, will establish it, on the ground of
mistake: usage of trade, and general opinion will have
again their weight.
But how can that be done? said I,How will
you make it appear?Few men really know the law.
There are several waysfirst, by making it
probable
.
Ask any merchant, if he would have refused, for
any other reason than, because of the trouble that it would
have given him, to incorporate the law itself into
his note of hand? the law of endorsement, for
example
,
or dischargeor
notice
.
He will tell you, no.And why should he have
refused
?
He knew that the law, whatever it was,
governed
his contract, as effectually, as if it were written
therein
.
But there is another way. File a Bill of
Discovery
;
and compel the creditor to answer, on oath, as to
his best knowledge, and belief of the law, at the time
of contracting; and as to his
intention
.Yet both of these
grounds may fail. But we have another in reserve, that
cannot fail. A man may plead ignorance of the law;
may swear that he did
not
know of its existence; or
deny that he would have admitted it, into the terms of
the contract, for any consideration, (and such a man
would not
expressly
include the statute of limitation, on
one of his notes, I dare say.) Yet, it is always enough
for your purpose, if he have entered into the contract, in
the regular course of business; if he have sold his goods,
or charged his labour, at a fair market price.
Why?---because profit is but another name for
insurance
,
premium. He, who insures, is bound to
know the course of trade; the usage and the risk; and,
it is his own folly, if he do not demand a sufficient
premium
,
for his indemnification. It were as ridiculous,
therefore, for a man that has sold goods to another, to
allege, that he did not know of the state insolvent law;
as, after he had put his name to a policy, to declare,
that he did not know the perils of the voyage. In both
cases, he has received a fair and faithful consideration,
in his own stipulated profit; or in the regular
market
price
.
Does he complain of this? Does he complain that
he is not
paid?
that he only knew a part of the risk?
You see that I have supposed the worst possible case,
for my doctrine. Yet he
is
paid, whether he know it or
not. Who establishes the price? Are they ignorant
men? It is their own folly. But
are
they so, in reality?
No. They are sober, calculating men; who take into
view, all contingences; the risk of failure, as of
shipwreck, fire and hurricane. He, therefore, who sells
at the same profit with them, receives the same
premium
;
and is
paid
, though he may not know it, for the
risk that he runs.
Shall the insurer be permitted to come to you, after
you have publickly entered into an agreement with him,
and he has lost; and demand to be set free from his
contract
,
because he did not know what he was about,
when he made it; or, on the ground that he has not been
paid?
Shall he tell you, that there is a
moral obligation
on
you, to refund? You would laugh in his face.
And why not laugh in the face of that man, who
comes to you, after you have been discharged, under the
insolvent law, and asks you to pay for goods, which you
bought of him, at a market price; and tells you of your
moral obligation
to him? The cases are precisely
parallel
.
But you forget; said Ithinking that I had him,
sure enough. He is not
paid
at all. He has sold his
goods on a credit.
Nor, is the insurer actually
paid
. Both receive
notes, and take the risk of payment.
Perhaps, said Elizabeth, timidly, there may be
something to justify this doctrine, in the difference of
prices that we see, in different cities. In BostonI
have heard, I think, that there is no insolvent law, there
goods are much cheaper, I am told, than here.
The eyes of Hammond streamed fire. Thank you,
said he; thank you, Miss Adams.
That
had escaped
me. It is very true. Nay---the difference of price in
every city, will prove the same thing. No matter how
honest a man is, he will sell his goods to one person,
at a less price, on a
credit
than to
another
-- thereby,
proving, what I say; that the
profit
which he charges,
is the
premium
for the risk.
Thus, I think, that I have shown first---that though
the state law were unconstitutional; still, if it made,
expressly
,
a part of the contract, it would have governed or
qualified it. And, secondly, that it matters not, whether
it be constitutional or not; inserted in the body of each
separate contract, or not; still, if the contract have
been made in the usual course of trade; in a state, where
the law was
supposed
to be in force; that even then, the
law was a part of the contract.
I confess, that my opinion is a good deal changed,
upon the subject, said I, I had never reflected on it
before. I had always a notion in my mind that there
was only one way of paying a debt; and
that
, by money;
but I now see that there are such things as alternative
obligations; and, indeed, little else than alternative
obligations
contracts,
that are
qualified
in a thousand
ways, though apparently
absolute
, upon their face.
Hammond smiledupon my word, said he, you
fall, very naturally, into our technical phraseology. You
understand it, I
hope
.
I
hope
that I do, said I, a little piqued.
Well, well, don't be angry.
But, you were somewhat bold, for a young manI
thinkmy friend, said Elizabeth, just now. I have
waited to hear you through; and I confess, that I find you
quite intelligible. I allude to your manner of speaking
about Judge Marshall. He is a great and good man,
Mr. Hammond.
Indeed he is! answered Hammond, with
enthusiasm
,
and that is the reason, why I reprobate such
absurdity
as this. Do you think that I would speak as I
do of it, were it the blundering of a common man?
No. But hear me. You think me arrogant. I am
not. I am only bold and honest. I never say these
things, however sudden and rash they
appear
, without
having first weighed and considered them well.
Judge Marshall says that it matters not whether
the contract be made before, or after the statute. I have
already shown you that it
may
make all the difference
in the world; and that, it
does
make it, in the cases
named: that, if the law were made
after
the contract
was entered into, the law could not, by any possibility,
have been in the contemplation of the parties; but that if
the law were made
before
the contract, it not only
might
have been, under their contemplation; but, unless
excepted
in the contract,
must
have made a part of it, if the
contract were in the usual course of trade.
He says too, that it matters not, whether the contract
be entered into between the citizens of different states; or
of the same state.
There he is wrong again. The difference is broad
and manifest. Let each state act within her own
jurisdiction
,
upon the contracts of her own citizens; and
of them only; and there will then be no jarring or conflict,
with her neighbours. It is very right that she should not
meddle nor interfere with a foreign or sister jurisdiction.
Thus, if the debtor and creditor be both residents of
Pennsylvania
,
the Pennsylvania state courts may settle the
question. But if it be between a citizen of Pennsylvania,
and one of New York, the only suitable authority is
their common superiour, the United States Court. They
both want an
umpire
. I say nothing of what is called
the
lex loci
, the law of the place; for that is only a
subject
of general squabbling and doubt.
Judge Marshall says too, that imprisonment makes
no
part of the contract
. I shall not stop to quarrel
with the language of the proposition. I will content
myself
,
at present, with understanding it.
Now, I undertake to say that he is
mistaken
, for I
love to treat great men respectfully. It
is
a part of the
contract, and a substantial part. It is what all parties
expect; look to; and provide for; nay, it is that, which
drives the debtor to payment, and gives power to the
creditor. If it were not, why is any insolvent law
necessary
?
If imprisonment were
not
a part of the contract,
where would be the necessity of pleading a discharge
of the
person
, in any caseparticularly as the
stipulation
or consent to imprisonment, does not appear, in
terms, upon the contract? Nayhow dare a creditor
imprison a man?and why is he not instantly
discharged
on motion, after arrest,
in every case?
If Judge Marshall be
right
, the debtor would be so
discharged;and the creditor would be subject to an
action for false imprisonmentnay, the very officer
himselfand jailor.
Yetmark the reasoning of the court. They
admit
a power to be in each state, sufficient for protecting
vol. ii. B
the
person
of a debtor discharged within it, for ever.
Yet, they deny to it, the power of protecting his
property
.
The distinction is ridiculous. I will undertake to
show, at a suitable time, thatone of these two things is
true:either, that the individual states may protect
property,
and
person, both;or, that they cannot protect
either
. I hold myself answerable for this promise.
And I shall redeem it, one day or other, though
uttered
now, in conversation, without going to the feudal
tenures, or
magna carta;
or, as the blockheads in
court call it,
magna charter
.
By this construction of the Supreme Court, each
state is permitted to exercise a power, which has ever
been;
is;
and ever will be, a source of jealousy and heart
burning, throughout the whole confederacy. It makes
certain of them, places of refuge, where a debtor,
honest
or dishonest, has but to touch the soil, and he is free.
It permits one state to interfere, directly; and in terms;
without the formality of any investigation, between the
obligations of debtor and creditor, from another state.
That isby this construction, a man is permitted to
run away from one state, where all his contracts have
been made; and throw himself into the protection of
another
state, that he never saw, till hunted thither, by
the avenger.
But suppose that another construction were
adopted
.
This
is, to my view, a false and perilous
interpretation
;
hastily given, and obstinately supported,
merely
for the purpose of
evading
, what could not be
denied
,
that the states, in their individual capacity, may
pass
insolvent
laws.
The court
admit
that. But then, in seeking for the
definition of an
insolvent
law, they, not aware of the
mischief that they were doing, have
denied
, that a state
may protect the property, in
any case
and
granted
that
it may protect the person, in
every case
.
Buthad they given a different construction, that
for which I contend, to it, there would have been no
such evil to apprehend; no conflicting of jurisdiction;
no clashing of power; no refuge for villany; and there
would be found sufficient analogy in other admitted
powers, of the confederated and individual
governments
,
to justify it.
My construction is this:that each state has the
right to protect the property
and
person of
her own
citizens
against
her own citizens;
but not the right
to protect either the
property
or
person
, of even her
own citizens, against the citizens of another state
and still less, the person or property of the citizens of
another state, against other citizens of other states.
She has nothing to do with them. She has no
business to meddle with them. Let the parties go
before their common tribunal, the lofty and
impartial
umpireappointed by the constitution. I
mean
the United States Courtyou smilebut, they
are
impartial
,
very
impartial, where their
own
authority is
not in question. And how could you expect them to
be, where it is? Are they not men, with the infirmities
of men? subject to the temptation of men? and to some
others, perhaps, that mere men are not subject tobut
only judges and lawyers.
I am in earnest. But, I would qualify the
construction
that I have just given, by adding that, the
law of the state, to operate righteously on its own
citizensshould not effect
existing
contracts. Do you
understand me?
Perfectly, I answered. You mean to say, that if
two men contract, when there is no insolvent law in
existence, that a future law ought not to effect the
contract
.
Nonot exactly that. In my mind, there is no
question, that such a law may pass, and operate, upon
even existing contracts; but then, there will be always
a
moral
obligation in the debtor, after he shall be
discharged
,
to pay the debt, from which he has been
discharged
,
by a law, passed
subsequently
to his
contract
.
Perhaps, said Elizabeth, timidly,
perhaps
I have
not rightly comprehended you, Mr. Hammond. You
will please to set me right, if I have not. This is a new;
but, I hope, not an unprofitable discussion to me. I
hear a great deal of complaint; and see a great deal
of distressandbut let us talk over that, at another
time. At present, I have a thought, that there is
either
some fallacy, or some errour in your argument.
Moral
obligation, I take to be distinct from
legal
obligation
.
Is it so?
It is. And
that
too, is it not? which the law will
not lend its aid to enforce? continued Elizabeth.
Yes.
If then, your doctrine be sound, or construction, I
believe you call it; would it not follow that no
moral
obligation is left, after the law has destroyed the
contract
.
Pardon me. I have not expressed my own
meaning. I am unused to argument; and there is some
difficulty in using the proper language. You say that
each state has a right, to pass an insolvent law, in
certain
cases. Do not the citizens know this? are they
not bound to know it?
Hammond snorted, like a race-horseprotruded his
bald head, half across the table, in astonishment; and
his eyes dilated to twice their usual magnitude, while
she continued.
And is it not, legally and by construction at least, if
not in
fact
, in the contemplation of the parties, to a
contract
,
when they enter into it, that the state
may
destroy
it, or suspend it, in a certain way?
Upon my word! said Hammond, after a silence, of
at least ten minutes;
that
is passing strange! For three
years have I been meditating upon this very question
for three whole years!and yet, that idea never entered
into my head. Miss Adams, I thank you Unassisted
good sense may do, what will amaze the profoundest, at
times. You have driven me to higher entrenchments.
He arose, when he had said this; threw back his head,
and trod, less like a dwarf, before her, than I had ever
seen him.
Yes!it is true. If my construction be right
and I feel assured that it
is
, there can be no
moral
obligation
,
even where the law was made
after
the
contract
.
All that can be required of one is, to do what he has
promised
. My contract then, is not to pay one
thousand
dollars, at all events; but to pay it, unless the law
set me free.
It is like the case of endorsement. If an endorser
be not
notified
, he is exonerated. Every man knows
this; or is supposed to know it. It would be ridiculous
for me, to tell the most conscientious moralist, after he
had been exonerated from his endorsement, by the
negligence
of an endor
see
, that there was, nevertheless, a
moral
obligation, on his part, to pay the debt.
So, in the statute of limitation. The law maintains
that there
is
a
moral
obligation to pay a debt, barred
by the statute. I deny this. But, granting that there
isstill, it does not affect my case. The construction
of the courts, though not law in itself, is the evidence of
what is law. People are bound to know what this
construction
is, just as much as if it were a part of the
statute
itself. And, therefore, where the construction of the
courts is, that, a subsequent
promise
revives a debt, which
is barred by the statute of limitation, infancy or
insolvency
;
such a promise becomes a new and substantial
agreement
;
and requires no
moral
obligation to give it force;
except to evade the metaphysicks of law, respecting
a
nudum pactum;
or a contract all on one side.
I was pleased, I confessand the evening had worn
away, in a manner, that I was little accustomed to; I
felt a more inward and sustaining dignityhad a
better
opinion of man's nature; his prerogatives, and scope,
and grandeur, than I had before. It was not possible,
to hear Hammond converse on a subject, that roused
him, without, notwithstanding his cold, haughty,
arrogant
denunciation of great men, without feeling as if
you had stood upon the hills, and seen giants wrestling,
and pitching the bar. Every movement of his intellect
was so prompt, bold, and athletick.
So pleased was I, indeed, that, after he had gone, I
renewed the subject, with Elizabeth.
What do you think of him? said I.
He is a very extraordinary man; said Elizabeth.
But passionate, supercilious, and abruptis he
not?
vol. ii. B 2
Yes. But he has great command of himself; and
his superciliousness, I observe, is never shown toward
them, that the world think below him. To such, he is
really humble, forbearing, and patient. Of his vanity,
I hardly know what to say. He often startles me, with
it; but less, I believe, from its abundance, than from its
honesty. I watch other people; and I find them vain.
But, it is not so easily detected in them. He is bold,
and imprudent. I remember an instance. It is long
ago;a lady, of great good sense and observation,
rebuked him, in a manner that delighted me, for it
But you shall see her; and judge of her, for yourself. She
is a remarkable woman. The instance, of which I
was speaking, was this.
He had been highly wrought upon, where we were,
and strangely eloquent. He never says fine things;
but, it is difficult to forget anything that he
has
ever said,
when he has been in earnest. The people, here, begin
to treat him with great respect and consideration.
Why, said Mrs H, to him, why did that lady
listen to you, so breathlessly?and the others too
why was it?
Because I astonished them, said he, in his calm,
natural way.
No
she answered, smiling, at the oddity of his
reply, and startled too, at his boldnessperhaps not.
You are a
little
loud, you know, in conversation. I
smiled.
No, pardon me, Madam, said he, not a
little
loud; I
am
very
loud. You meant to tell me so; but, you were too
polite
. I know it. I have heard it, again and again. I have
tried to learn wisdom, by reproof; but, I cannot. I am
accustomed to it. It does not hurt me. I was well
nigh running away with a womanmonster that I am,
because she told me, in a lady like way, that I had been
writing about what I did not understandand thatI
was a
fool
. You meant to tell me nearly the same
thing. I am too loud. I am sorry for it; but I am so,
without knowing it Will you be kind enough to check
meI shall understand no signno hintbut speak
out, whatever it be, and I shall be grateful for it. I
am called ruderude!because I shake off the poisonous
dew, from every flower that I touchbefore it has time
to scorch its vitals. No, madam; you are not the first,
whose temples have throbbed at the sound of my voice.
One man, a very dear friend, has told me, that he could
endure anything but my voice, in argument; another,
that it was like a clarionet in his ears; another, a lady
after I had told her a long story, for the second time,
which I
knew
that I had told her before; and, when I
reproached her, for her forgetfulness, or complaisance
she told me, that she never understood half that I
saidthat my voice frightened her; and that, no
stranger
,
or female, without nerves of cast iron, could
endure it. NomadamI thank you. I feel your
good intention; and will reform. But do not despair;
when I have become quiet and meekyou laughI do
not wonder at it.
Do not imagine that you are the first, that has
reproved
me; noI remember something of the same kind,
at this moment. I had been particularly fine; and the
man, to whom I was talking, was, to my notion, the
most respectful auditor that I had ever hadI stopped.
He made no answer. His eyes were rivetted upon my
breast. At last, he drew a long breath.
Mighty powers, he cried out, what a play of
langs! And, on another occasion too, where I had
been very eloquent and convincing
very
a sweet
woman
looked me up in the facethere was a dead
silence
.
Pray, said she, had'nt you a
deaf
grandfather?
The question puzzled me, exceedingly, for a
while; and the company, I remember, laughed,
heartily
,
at the time; but it was long before I understood the
drift of it. She must have thought, by my voice, that
I not only
had
a deaf grandfather, but that. I had been
brought up, or
raised
with him; and that my deaf
grandfather
was in a fair way to have a deaf grand-daughter
in law
, if I should ever marry.
Some other conversation passed; and, when he had
gone, I asked Mr. H. what he thought of him,
continued
Elizabeth.
The vainest creature in the world, said shebut
then, his vanity is like the vanity of no other human
being. He seems to boast without intending it;
without
even knowing it; and, all the while too, as if he
honestly believed every word that he said.
He
does
believe it, my dear Madam, said I. Nay,
what is worse, I am afraid that we should find it hard
to undeceive him.
I am afraid so, too! said she, leaving me. Make
what you can of him, Elizabeth. He is beyond
my
skill. They
were astonished!
hahaha!Yes
I will be bound they were; such a noise would astonish
anybody.
I reflected on the matter, my good brother, after
she had gone. Another man, said I, would have
talked, if he could, all the while; just as Hammond did;
thereby, showing that he
knew
his own powers of
entertainment
;
thereby proving, that he
believed
himself, to
be worthy of engrossing all the conversation. Yet, he
would never have
owned
itnever have said it.
Hammond
would. There is the difference between
Hammond's
vanity, and that of other men.
She is right; said I, to myself. My sister is
right.

...Reconciliation.
The
next day, Hammond led me out, through the
borders
of the city; and amused me with such a variety of
information, anecdote, and wit, that I was seized with
a strange, troubled, anxious admiration of him.
Where had he acquired it?among men? Nohe had
been less among men, than I; though older, by two or
three years. Where then?by studying his own
nature
.
I looked at him with amazement. Touch what
theme I would, he had always something to say upon
it, that was new, and worth repeating. I found too,
that, what he said, was said, in a manner so peculiarly
his own, so simple, so energetick! that I was able to
repeat it, word for word, sometimes, though the same
things, perhaps, would have made no impression upon
me, had another said them; or, had I read them. His
manner was often sudden, vehementabrupt,
pleasant
for a moment or two, but not longeryet so
indignant
,
vivid, burning and sarcastick, that I felt an
unaccountable sense of his superiority oppressing me.
Go where he would, there seemed to be no thought of his
ugliness, even in the boys. Every body saluted him,
respectfully. But he had no companions, I observed,
among the youthful. Two or three middle-aged men,
and several aged ones, came out to meet him; and stood
and held his hands, as if he had been one of them, while
we went along. I felt like a boy in their presence.
At last, we came to the woods---where the most
beautiful
stream in the world, goes, making a picture at
every bend before you.
How happened it, said I, while we stood looking
at the water below us, which ran, smoothly and swiftly,
in one part of the stream; and then broke out into quick,
turbulent flashes---and bright sparkles, at another---that
we pass by the countenance of Nature in her repose
and tranquillity, as if we saw it not; and that, we are
only startled into exclamation or delight, by meeting
with it, when it is agitated or disturbed. It is that---
but you are about to speak---go on.
It is a part of human nature, William. Power is
never felt or acknowledged, unless it be mischievous.
A great and good man, who spends a whole life, in
fulfilling
every duty, and appointment
of
life; who is a
father and a husband; a brother and a child; a citizen
and a magistrate---who lives and dies in the scrupulous
discharge of every amiable duty, to God and man---
how far is he known---by whom---and how? For a few
miles---by a few people, and only as a good man? Few
believe him to be a great man; --for, whatever may be
his greatness, it has never been visible to them. No
man ever was
great
in the management of his family,
and relationship with society. To be great, he must
have the
power
, at least, of being mischievous;
and even then, until he
be
mischievous, people cannot
be certain of his power to be so. Look at that water;
It is far deeper, more useful, and richer, with a greater
multitude of fish, just there, where it is going, quietly
and smoothly, on its way, reflecting you willow trees;
and darkened by the shadow of that green bank---see!
that where I point --how singular!---one cannot tell
where the water touches the bank, so uniform is the
deep green, and so vivid the reflection: but what I was
about to say, is this---that we pass that part of the
stream with careless insensiblity. Yet
here
, we stop, and
lift up our hands in delight;---
here
, where the water
appears
to be spouting up, out of the broken rock, in a
thousand bustling cascades---just as if Moses himself
had been here---and smitten the solid granite---till it
dissolved in water spouts---or gushed out, through a
hundred shattered fissures, in brightness and smoke.---
Yet here there is no utility in it---it is only beauty. So
with the human character. It is
ruffled to light
---nay,
I once wrote half a dozen lines on the same subject----
perhaps I can repeat them.
The willow tree stood, with her tresses as bright,
As airy and high, as a warriour-feather;
Now bending in shade, and now stooping in light;
While, we wandered abroad by the moon, together
Their braiding was dark, while the breezes were still:
But brightened, whenever they over it played:
So the broad and deep riverthe smooth running rill
Go silent and dark, in their channels, until
They are ruffled to light. So our pulses are still,
Till we flash through some path that convulsion hath made.
The willow and water are emblems of life
We darken in peace; but we brighten in strife.
I do not remember the words exactly, but they are
somewhat after that fashion. I wrote them hastily;
and am not often, as you know, foolish enough to
repeat
my own poetry.
It was very true. I had never heard Hammond
repeat
a line of it before; and I verily believe, that he did
not remember twenty lines, of all that he had ever
written
.
So too, in the moral word, continued Hammond.
Great virtues are, by the very law of their being,
unobtrusive
,
calm and beneficent. Men see nothing, and hear
nothing of them. Women fulfil their duties, with all
the affectionate secrecy and silence of devotion, every
day, in the world;yet, what woman is taken notice of,
while she performs only her duty? Look at the French
Revolution? The women that became conspicuous then,
during the reign of terrour, were not
greater
, in
reality
,
than while they were nursing their children, or
comforting
their husbands; and watching over their
household
.
Yet, till they were sprinkled with the blood of
their dear onesor, had became sanguinary
participators
in the revolution, they were unknown. So with
politicians and writers. The arts of peace are
beneficent
and gentle. Those of war, tumultuous and
confounding
.
Nay(after a pauseduring which, he
uncovered
his bald headand lifted up his large, full eyes to the
sky, as if he were overheard thereand was not
ashamed
,
nor afraid to be overheard there)even with God
himself, it is altogether the same. We are not
conscious
of his presence, and power and greatness, at
such a time as this, when all creation is actually
sleeping
under his outstretched hands. But anon, when he
arisesand would rebuke uswhen he shakes the
skies; and the earth trembles; then do we cry out,The
Lord God of heaven and earth! The Lord God
omnipotent
!
There was one remarkable peculiarity in the
countenance
of this man, which I have omitted to mention,
as it deserves. It was this. His eyes were very large;
and, in general, very ugly; particularly, when he was
deadly pale, as he was, for ever, when agitated or moved
and his rough hair was tumbledand tossed all over
his head,. But, when they were uplifted,the large
black ballswith a wide, glittering, white edge below
themthey were, if not the most beautiful eyes, that I
ever saw, the most awful and amazing. They had
the faculty of dilitation and contraction, like those of
the cat family, and the owlsuch as I never saw,
before
,
in any human eyes. It was not, that the pupil
enlarged
but
the pupilirisand ball
instantaneously
,
would grow to twice their usual size. At such a time
too; and, hardly at any other, was there a certain unity of
expression all over the face of Hammond; a vast harmony
his large white teeth, and red mouth---and broad
nostrils were actually sublime. In looking at them,
ugly as they individually were, all except the mouth,
you would absolutely forget the character of each, in
the wonderful expression of the whole. In fact,
Hammond
the Dwarf, was made to look up---everlastingly
up---at the sky, or into the face of his Maker. When
he communed with men; or with the creatures and
things below himhis face was more that of a brute
beast, than of a human creaturecoarse, broad and
sensual---to such a degree, that his chaste and
expressive
mouth, took the character of gloating sensuality
---low appetiteand even gluttony. There was at such
a time too, no unity of expression in it. His eyes
appeared
to have no connexion with each other---no
communication---and
less, if possible, with the rest of his
face,---while one was broad and open---the other was
nearly shut---I have seen this many a time: and one, I
have seen lighted up to a dazzling depthwhile the
other was cowering like a serpent's eye, among the
coarse, abundant lashes. At the time that I speak of,
however, there was none of that contradiction. And
I actually shook with the noise of his heart; and felt
my
heart dying within me, when he stood up and shouted,
with a solemn clear voice---which was returned to him
from all the hills about---The Lord God of Heaven and
earth! The Lord God omnipotent!
It began to grow dark; and we were yet in the
beautiful
dim wood that skirted the hills about our city.
You will spend the evening with us, said I
Do you desire it?
Yes.
You are cordial. said he. I accept your
invitation
.
But---we are alone now. You know me. You
have known me for some years. I want a friend. I
have looked about me. I find few, that I would wish
to be my friendsnone, that I would take much trouble
with, to make so. Don't interrupt me. I am weary of
acquaintances. You hated me cordially, once. You
hate me no longer. I would have you love me, as
cordially
.
Three months from to-day, I shall offer you
my hand. I do not ask you if you will take it. I leave
you three months to think of it. It is no light matter,
for men like us, to swear friendship. It must be done
cautiously, deliberately; but once sworn, we are
like
brothers
.
There was a peculiar emphasis in what he said; and,
particularly in the word
brothers
. It startled me then,
I remember; but, I paid less attention to it, at the time,
than afterward.
I offered him my hand. He put it back, proudly.
No, said he not yet, William Adamsnot yet.
Let us not be precipitate I want something to love;
something that will love medie for me. You are the
man, I think. Women are out of the question. They
vol. ii. C
cannot love at all, as I would be lovedand if they
could, God has forbidden it to me.
His voice trembled.
I thought that you
had
such a friend, said I.
Whom do you mean?
Young W.
He!he, a friend, such as I want. NoDo you
know me? Do you know him? No, I am not to be
flattered or made a fool of. I have no respect for
boyish
attachment. The friendship of boys, and the love
of girls are not aliment for my stomach. I covet the
affection of children, but not of grown children. Mr.
W. is a young man of uncommon genius; but he wants
nerve, fortitude, iron. Stoplet us go by my
chambers
,
and I will show you what he is. On the way, I
will tell you how our acquaintance began. It was one
of his seeking. You know that I am a solitary fellow.
The young men avoid me: and the old are afraid of
me; and this very day, you have seen many men cross
the street to speak to me; and stand before me; with their
hats offwho, a few years ago, would have thought it
presumption in meto.
We were now upon the pavement again; and were
interrupted by a shriek; and saw a crowd gathered a
little before us. I sprang forwardbut was withheld
by Hammond. Stop! said he. Let us take our
measures, before we get into the mobthat we may act
in concert. We shall be separated there. Just as he
said this, a young woman leaned out of a window, that
we were passing, to fasten the blinds. I stopped to
admire her neck and shoulders. They were most
beautifully
turned; and there was a noble, patient loftiness
in her look, that I never forgot afterward. I mention
this, because it agitated me, at the time, and because
but no matter. Before we met again, an
unaccountable
notion beset me, that she was lameand.
We soon found, that the uproar was caused by a
brutal
ruffian, a drayman, who, in the mere wantonness of
his heart, had struck a young negro girl, a blow with
his whip, that brought the blood through her thin
clothes. It was actually oozing out, and trickling
down to her feet, when we came in sight. My first
impulse
was to knock the scoundrel down.
Stop!said Hammond, imperatively. Silence!
what is the meaning of all this?
All began to speak at once.
Have done! he cried, leaping into the middle of
the crowd, that gave away on all sides, some in terrour,
and some in mockeryand facing the ruffian.
The turbulent voices all died away. Every face was
turned to his. The poor girl, who had been sobbing,
as if she were cut to the bone, stopped, all at once;
and from the scornful, malignant scowling of the
rascal
,
with the whip, I began to apprehend that I should
soon be wanted in the aftray;---but nohe could not
well stand in the rebuke of the Dwarf alone. Every
look was upon Hammond. He had not moved his eyes
from the face of the man, for nearly a minute.
How is this? said he, at last. Have you struck
her?are you not ashamed of it?
Instead of replying, the scoundrel raised his whip,
and, for a moment, seemed to menace Hammond.
He
only smiled I should have cut his throat, upon the
spot---but
he
only smiled. I waited the issue.
The next moment, the whip resoundedlike a pistol;
and the poor girl leaped, upright, from the earth---as if
she had been cut through the heart.
I had raised my arm, and---but Hammond was
already
at work. I looked at him---he was black in the
face. He stood holding upon the naked and brawny
wrist of the other---who was struggling with him---and
appeared searching for something, in his side pocket, at
the same time.
Do
not strike her again---said Hammond---
do
not. I would not have your blood upon my hands.
I will, by God!cried the other, attempting it,
violently, but in vain.
Begone! cried Hammondbiting his lipsand
knitting his browsto the stupid girlBegone!
She shook, and obeyed him.
The man wrenched away his hand, at last, and
would have pursued her.
Another step!said Hammond, plucking at his
arm.
That other step was taken; and, ere you could have
clapped your hands thrice, I heard the lash strike the
limbs of Hammond; and saw him, with his teeth
clenched
and
the blood issuing from his nostrils, kneeling
upon the breast of the other. Both were motionless.
The people retreated in consternation, and shrieked.
I plucked Hammond from the fellow; but he had
hardly
life enough to stand up; and the blood was in a little
puddle, on the earth where he ell. The man lay, in
the street, like a dead bodyhis neckcloth tornand
twisted round, and roundand his eyes blood-shot
It was a case of life and death;I had seen the blow,
with a whip too---and could I blame him!
Hammond put his hand to his side---and my first
thought was, that he had burst a blood vessel; but no---
he was only wounded. He had been stabbed in the
scuffle.
The man was taken up; and soon gave symptoms of
life;---and Hammond sent for a carriage; took me into
it, called upon the surgeon himself; and submitted to
inspection on the spot.
Such was his coolness, or insensibility, that he
continued
the conversation, in which we had been
interrupted
in the same tone, just as if nothing had
happened---till
the business was over.
What think you of it, Doctor? said he.
The Doctor shook his head.
Nonsense, Doctor. We know your profession.---
Law and physick are alike. We never shake our heads
in
bad
cases. It is then our business to keep up the
patient's heart. But in less serious matters, we shake
our heads, so that we may have the more credit for our
cures.
The Doctor laughed.
Do you think that there is any danger, Doctor---
any?
you understand me
Any,
said the surgeon, hesitating. There is aa
some
danger, you know, in every woundbut, I
we can tell better, tomorrow. If there should be any
inflammation
or.
My dear Neck or Nothingleave me alone with
the good man, a moment; said Hammond.
I started, at the old and well remembered name
and obeyed; and the surgeon told me, afterward, with
the air of one that cannot rightly believe what he has
just seen, with his own eyes, what passed between
them.
Tell me, said Hammond,
plainly;
and without
any shuffling, whether you would advise me, to be
prepared
for the worst? I feel that the wound is deep;
deeper, perhaps, than you think. I know that there is
one bad symptomit does not bleed, outwardlyit is
in a part, too, particularly subject to inflammation; and
I could feel that your probe did not follow all the turns
of the knife. My notion is, that I bent the blade, after
it entered my body; for, he tried, more than once, be
fore he could draw it out.
Can you bear it? said the surgeon.
Bear it!
bear what? answered Hammond; his
beautiful mouth curlingand nostrils dilating. I
can bear any thing. Am I to die?immediately? do
not fear to tell me so. There is no time to lose.
Bear
itI!whywhat have I to frighten me?A pure
conscience? Nolet me die. What have I to bind
me to life?No childrenno wifeno beloved one;
a monstera hideous and mis-shapen monsterno,
no good doctortell me at once, what is my peril?
I do not believe you to be in
great
danger; was the
cautious, uncomfortable reply; but the knife has gone
near, very near to a vital part; and, I am afraid, has
wounded an artery. We shall do the best, that we
can, for you. You shall have a bed in my house. I
will go, immediately, for Doctor Jeffriesbut, I would
Iit might be well, you know, tototo be
prepared
.
Every prudent man will be prepared. There
is no knowing what
may
happen.
Well, well doctor. I shall go home, if I can. I
thank you, nevertheless, for your offercome in,
William
.
I enteredhelped him into a carriage; and we were
soon at his own chamber; he, chatting, as
unconcernedly
,
vol. ii. C 2
as if there were no apprehension within his
heart.
But II could not talk. And, when the
consultation
,
which followed immediately, was over, I shed
tears, in thankfulness to heaven that it was
not
a
mortal
wound.
I was saying, said Hammond, as soon as they had
gonethat I could not brook acquaintances. I will
have no friend, who cannot lock and rivet his heart
to mine. I gave you three months, for a trial. It will be
long enough, for us to understand each other,
thoroughly
;
and then, if we both feel that we can embrace, like
men; and stand up together, against misfortune and
discouragement
it
will be well for us. If notlet us
then part, and never cross one another's path again.
You spoke of Wallace. Take that keythe
secretary
thereopen it. I opened the cabinet, and
took out a bundle of papers. Yesyesthat's the
bundlethank you.This letter, I wrote to him a long
time ago. Read it. It will give you a better notion of
what I am; and of what my friendship is, than you can
now have, of either. Naynot just now. Read it, when
you are at home. Meanwhile, let me tell you, as I
promised, how we became acquainted;but first, tell
me what you saw, in that window, as we passed? Some
angel, I supposethey are very plenty, of late. Every
square has a few of the breed. You colour. I have
not hurt you, I hope. Was it any body that you know
andandwhy, what alarms you?
I know not; I answered, I know that I have never
seen her before; and yet, I feel as if I hadsome where,
I know not where.
Her!
whom?
That woman. I cannot get her out of my mind.
I feel as if I had been acquainted with her, in my
childhood
in
another worldor as if I had seen her picture
some where.It is'nt as if I had seen
her
.
Pohnonsense. This dreaming is common with
your inflammatory spirits. Every beautifully-faced, or
proudly-walking woman; every timid and delicate
innocent
creature; and every superb one, is full of
sentiment
or magnificence, to the high in blood.
And the high in heart; said I.
He turned, and smiled; and
as
he turned, he caught
a view of his own countenance, in the mirror; it
darkened
.
A big head!a big head! said he, glancing
at me.
I understood him; it went to my heart; but, I had
presence of mind enough to reply, in his own words,
just as he had used them, years and years before
striking
my breast, as I did so, just in his own impressive,
strange manner.
Yeaand a big
heart
too!
He grasped my handsthe swarthy red of his bald
forehead, vanishedvanished, like a shadow; his frown
went offbut, he remained deeply affected, for a
minute
or two.
I thank you, said he; it is true. I have a
big
heart.
So he had. Had he not? He could not have
said
so, as he did, if he had not.
Some day or other, you may meet that woman
again said he; and then, you will remember these
very sensations; and imagine that they were
sympathetick
and ominous! Was the woman beautiful?
No, I replied; but wise, and lofty of heart, I am
sure.
Yes, yes, I dare say so. And, marry whom you
will, dear Neck or Nothing(I started againI
could'nt get reconciled to the name;) for marry
somebody
,
you must, and will; and then, I shall give you up;
this it is, that makes a woman of me, when I think of
opening my heart to one that will not,
cannot
, in the
nature
of things abide, for ever, in itit tempts me to
forswear
opening it at all. But, I was saying that, when
you are married, no matter to whom, there will always
be some such incident in your memory, to hallow your
delusionas ifI suppose these phenomena are
common
.
No; said I, seriously. That neck and
countenance
no
matterI cannot talk of her. I wish that
I could forget her. I am poor and lonely; and I shall
never meet her again.
Hammond smiled benevolently, compassionately, at
first; and then, while I watched his face, it took a slow
expression
of pity, then of scornand then of bitterness.
I felt my cheeks burn.
Your love
must
be valuable, and
very
permanent
It is said I,My love
is!
My hatred
is!
My
friendship
is!
Take your choice.
I like your spiritlet us leave the subject. O, I
remember. I had begun to tell you of
Wallace
I will
finish it now, if you please. My acquaintance began,
three years agoI was on a visit to a friend of mine.
He had in his possession some work that I had written.
An author too! said I, with surprise.
Yes, an author, continued Hammond, in the same
tone. He had shown it, or lent it to Mr. Wallace;
and, expecting to see me, had told of it; and made a sort
of promise to bring us together.
There is a note, said the man, handing a
paper
to me, with his strong countenance all illuminated,
in which you have some concern. The writer wants
to know you. Read it, and tell me what you think of
it.
I read it. I was the subject of it. It had,
evidently
,
been written for me to see. It was laboured and
unnaturalno
note
at all. It was a piece of
affected
enthusiasm; full of powerful, but unmeaning words;
without principle or feeling, or sincerity.
I do not wish to know him, said I, returning the
note.
He smiled, and told me the character of the man; that
he was a poet, highly gifted, enthusiastick, but
inexperienced
Still, I felt no desire to be acquainted with him.
He was too much a man of the world, for me.I did'nt
much like being cajoled, so barefacedly.
But, not long after, I happened to be in company,
where the conversation fell upon the poets of the day;
and his name was mentioned by a fine intelligent girl,
who had
known
him from his very boyhood, without
having understood him. She had rather a happy
talent
at description; and a quick sense of the ridiculous.
She described him as
immeasurably
affected
inordinately
vain
superlatively
conceited, &c.&c. (
using
the same kind of disproportionate language, which
you will hear, every day, from what are called smart
womenwhose vivacity and impertinence are mistaken
for wit and talent;) and, finally, she gave us an
imitation
of him, in one of his best fits of abstraction, in
a fashionable company, sitting apart, if you please,
and talking, for half an hour together, in a plaintive
voice, just loud enough to be overheard by the
company
about
poetrymelancholycold blue water
willow tresses washing themselves in the shadow,
and moonlightthe emptiness of worldly
enjoyment
and
especially of sensual enjoymentlike
some spirituality, looking with eyes of compassionate
wonder, upon the coarsenses of all mortal appetite;
and this, perhaps, with a glass of wine in one hand, and
a lump of cake in the othersurrounded by ribbons,
laces and chattering girlsand dressed in a suit of
perfectly
fashionable clothing, from head to footso
arranged as to prove, that, whatever else he thought of,
he did not forget the tailor.
I listened to all that she said of him; and left her,
wondering less at the follies, of which she had been
speaking, in a man of genius; than at
herself
, a woman
of fine judgment, and a good heart, for not discovering,
in the very excess of
his
vanity and pretension,
conclusive
evidence of sensibility and geniusfor
sensibility
and genius are inseparably combined; and always
proportioned to each other. I determined to see him;
and if it were not too late, to
save
him. I went out of
my way, for the purpose; and prevailed upon him, at
last, to comprehend that there was a time and a place
for all things; and that superlative poetry, misapplied,
would only be superlatively ridiculous. I taught him
that the spirit of poetry was a holy thing,a light, not
to be shown idly;an odour, and a flavour, not to be
diffused, but in holy places, and on holy occasions;
a kind of enchantment, that, to be acknowledged by the
multitude, should be withheld from their
encroachment
;
enshrined and unapproachable, except to the
pure of heart, and high of thought; to be touched
irreverently
even by the keeper himself, of it, only at the
peril
of blindness and confusion.
I studied his character, I tell you, as no other
man would ever have taken the trouble to study it. I
found the elements of his mind in pitiable, but shining
disorder. He was labouring under a moral
derangement
,
which the world could not understand, and would,
in time, mistake for intellectual derangement. He
seemed to have no settled principles of actionno aim
no object, except an indefinite one, that kept
continually
shifting. He was ambitious, to be sure; but not
for eminence, in any one particular thing. His
ambition
was rather a diseased appetite, for present
notoriety, than the gallant longing of a great heart for
an imperishable, and distant reputation. To
his
view,
the
present
was immortality; and he was foolish enough,
to believe, that the future
must
echo to the voice of the
present. He was, emphatically, a man of
genius
though not a man of talent;but of such a genius, as I
would not that a brother, or son of mine should have,
for all the world.It was a kingly
shadow
, with the
shadow
of regal habiliments, about it, which, when
you approached them, fell off and faded into brilliant
exhalationlike coloured ice; in the sunshine. Talent
is substance. Genius is show. Talent is a primary
quality of things, like weightgenius the secondary
quality, like colour.
Mr. Wallace I mean to say, was not
conspicuous
for talent, weight or substance of material; but he
was for geniusfashionshapecolour and beauty.
He was incapable of reasoning, for five minutes
together
,
with any thing like continuity of purpose; and
was almost incapable of understanding a legitimate
deduction
.
His colloquial powers were showy, and
artificial
;
and his best conversation, at one time,
although
he improved somewhat, before I left him, was a
perpetual digression. He never understood how to
introduce
a story, an illustration, or even a remark; but,
let him say what he would, when he was in
company
,
where he wished to shine, it always appeared
premeditated; as if he had just been reading about it;
and was determined to talk about it, before it was
forgotten
.
Then too, he had tricks of forgetfulness, and
abstraction, that every body could see through; bursts
of enthusiasm, that all could perceive were counterfeit;
little absences, and abruptnesses, which were evidently
predetermined, to disguise a want of aptitude for
conversation
,
under the appearance of originality,
precipitation
,
and extreme thoughtfulness. He had no real
sincerity of temper, and no true integrity of heart.
The fault was in his education. He was intended for
a man of the world; and he sought to be something
above
the world. The consequence was, that he became
neither the one thing nor the other. He had too much
genius
for the former; and too little good sense, for the later.
His mind was a world of beautiful material, all in
disorder
a
mine of brilliant, but unvisited ore. He had
far too little of natural grandeurthat awful and
distinct
something, which comforts and upholds great
men, under all the dispensations of the worldtoo
little
of that heroick originality, which shows itself
continually
;
and acts without study, or preparation; and far
too much of that showy counterfeit, which common
men employ themselves about, with indolent assiduity
troubled, impatient hearts, unsteady hands, and
confused
eyes. He was totally destitute of delicacy; and
would flatter his best friend, most grossly, to his face;
and that, not as if taken by surprise, or carried away
by passionate enthusiasm; but, as if he thought it
expected
;
or a part of good breeding; or, would produce
a return cargo of like nastiness;and, not unfrequently,
so as to convince a keen observer, that it was done for
the purpose of
doing
himin the way of management.
So too, he would bear flattery in turn, that ought to
offend any man: or, if that were withheld, he would
speak of himself, in the most extravagant terms, not as
I have known one man do, whom, I could not help
forgiving
for it, even at the time, offensive as it would
have been in another, merely because, he spoke, and
looked, as if he believed what he said; and as if he had
been driven to acknowledge, what he was too honest,
and too bold, to conceal or denyhis own proud opinion
of himself. No; Wallace did not speak of himself, in
that way, although he had seen the same person, that I
just spoke of; and, having been dazzled and
confounded
by
his
great self confidence, had striven to imitate it.
No! but he spoke of himself, in extravagant language,
just as if it were a matter of calculation with him;
and as if he, himself, did
not
believe what he said; but
only thought of making other men believe it. So that,
at last, if you studied him, as I did, you would,
probably
,
have come to the same conclusion; which was, that
he
thought
far too highly of himself, and
spoke
far
more highly of himself, than he thought.
In short, I studied him thoroughly; and set him down,
at last, as a brilliant, idle creature, wonderfully
mistaken
by the world; and altogether ignorant of himself;
presumptuous enough to imagine, that, by continually
practising upon two or three paltry maxims, such as
the veriest school boy will begin the world with, he
would be able to overreach the rest of mankind. A
pitiable
delusion; but one, that has led many a vain fellow
into a belief, that he was winding men about his finger,
who were only withheld, by their compassion for his
youth, from expressing their contempt for him. If he
could have got rid of his artificial enthusiasm;
counterfeit
melancholy; his propensity to imitation, trick
and deceita propensity which made him imitate what
was altogether beneath himself;play tricks with them
that he most loved, without any possible excuse,
unless
it were that of habit;and deceive people, where
he had nothing to gain, and every thing to lose, by
deceit
;and
if he had shut himself up, and away from
the world; studied and meditated for a few years,
until
his mind were composed, and habits of discipline and
self denial were established, he might become an
astonishing
man; but he was likely, from all that I saw,
to run only a short, useless, and shining career;
wandering
a while without aim, through the beautiful
element
that he had fallen intoheedless of the
wonderful
creatures that flew and swam, for ever about him
and terminating the whole,in darkness and forgetfulness.
I pitied him, as I have told youfrom my heart, I pitied
him. It appeared to me that it was yet possible to save
and reform him; and that, if any man
could
do it, it must
be some
friend;
a true and honest friend, such as I could
be to him. I had known the want of such an one, when
I was another Wallace. But none came. God
chose to save me, in his own way. I was well nigh
wrecked, to be sure, body and soul; but that only made
me the more thankful for his beneficent interposition;
and I asked myself how I should acknowledge the
mercy
.
By doing that to another, said my heart, which
had it been done to me, when I was young and
headstrong
,
would have saved me and mine, from utter
degradation
.
Till I encountered Wallace, I had few
opportunities
of putting my thought into execution. Some
young men, I had met, to be sure; but none that was
ever in the same danger as he; or so much like what I,
myself, had been, in my youth. You smile, William.
Well, smile on. I do feel like an old man. I am an
old man, when I compare myself with men, that were
born about the same time with me. I feel as if I were
of a generation before them. Smile onI am in truth,
much older at my heart; and far more experienced, than
you, although we are so nearly of an age. However,
to return to Wallace.With all his faults, I feel
assured that he was very sincere in his attachment to
me; and that he dealt more plainly and directly with
me, than with any body else; for the truth is, that he
was afraid of me, even while he loved me; that he
trembled
before me, even while it was a pride and boast with
him, that I was one of his dear, five hundred friends.
I have mentioned how I came to see him; and, one day
or other, perhaps, I may describe to you the whole of
our first interview. It would make you smile. He
was a good deal disturbed, and disappointed, when he
saw me. He had expected to find me, a stern,
thoughtful
,
and melancholy man, with a haughty forehead,
wicked mouth, and austere eye; and he found me so
totally
unlike what he expected, that it was a good while,
before he recovered from the shock, that my
appearance
gave him. Before I had well seated myself, I
vol. ii. D
found that there was quite too much electioneering
address
in his manner, for me. He was altogether too much
of the gentleman. I have said, that he was
disappointed
,
when he saw me; but he was yet more so,
when he heard me talk. But he was afraid to tell me
so; and was, therefore, put to the ridiculous necessity,
of concealing his mortification, by a feigned
enthusiasm
,
and surprise, which he continually expressed, at
whatever I said; it mattered not, how common place,
just as if he could discover some hidden meaning at
the bottom;and just, if he meant to make me believe,
that he could see through all my
affected
simplicity, and
directness; and detect the lurking and significant
mystery
,
thereinwith the readiness of a twin spirit
communing with another, before men, in some
unknown
language. This amused me a good deal, I
assure
you, for a time; but, at last, I felt a little offended;
and, particularly, when I found that he would not
understand
me, at all; according to the received meaning
of my words; and that he had the presumption to think of
flattering meas if any man could do that! William,
you know that I am not made to play upon other men
in that way; and still less, am I to be played upon. I
hate mystery. I always speak, as I think. My speech
is only audible thought. I think aloud. If played
upon
at all, it shall not be so gently. I cannot endure
the dainty fingering of white-handed people. I am
not a guitar, nor a jewsharp. If men will bring the
musick
out of my heart, let them leap upon it, at full
length, like Handel upon the great German organ, and
play upon it, with hands and feet. No! the little that
I have, shall not be teased and pestered out of me, by
babies. I continued near him. I began that night;
and, before I left that part of the country, I had put
him in training for greater matters;and, in time, if
he would have followed my advice, which was very
simple, and confirmed by experiment on myselfand
been content to labour steadily; and work, as if
idleness
in a man of genius, were impiety to God;as if
he felt that the
power
and
capacity
to be any thing,
was altogether the same thing, as to
be
any thing;
and that talent was not intuition:if he had done this,
and been content, under the disregard of the world;
awaiting, calmly, the consummation of his destiny;
giving
out, continually, that patient, affecting confidence in
his Maker, which a man of true genius, with all his
infirmities
,
cannot help giving, as an expression of
gratitude
,
any more than the wilderness can help giving out its
blossoming, and exhalation; and musick, and
thanksgiving
after
a shower, when the sunshine is upon it;if he
had been unintimidated, unyielding, determined against
temptation and trial;and had toiled on, for a few years
only, as I shall toil,
for ever and ever
, till the world
have gone through all her revolutions, with me, he
might have been a beautiful phenomenonnot perhaps,
an amazing one, perplexing the nations; but one, whose
coming and going, would be stayed for, and sorrowed
after by gentle hearts, and affectionate dispositions.
But enough of this. Let me relate two or three
anecdotes
of our acquaintance, that you may the better
understand
,
how I expect to be treated by
you
, if we ever
pledge
our
hands togetherand what is the worth of
my friendship
We were about parting one night. I found it
necessary
to speak to him, face to face, like a man. I told
him that sudden prepossessions were never to be
depended
upon: that the affection and esteem, of men, must
be rooted; or they perish, with the first trial of cold and
wind: that I
had
distrusted his
sincerity
---but that I
began
to think better of it. In short, I gave him a severe
lesson,---for, I had began to
love
him; and I wanted to
respect
him. He was like what I
had been
, in temper:
though I had never been a flatterer---and he was one;
partly, by feeling, partly by nature, and partly by a
settled design---giving out largely, that some of it, at
least, might return to him, in the circulation of society
---curse such munificence! I say.
Would you believe it?many months after this, I
received a letter from him; for I had consented to a
correspondence
,
that I might keep pace with the growth
of his thoughtand he wrote, oftentimes, very
beautifully
in
which he repeated, almost verbatim, the
remarks
that I had addressed to
him
, together with my
suspicion of
his
sincerity; and applied them to
me!
Had
he forgotten the author? or did he believe that I had?
No matter whichit showed the character of the man's
mind. He was more anxious to write a beautiful
letter
,
than a sincere one;more solicitous for effect, than
for friendship. He was disappointed, and could not
bear to own it. He was like some young girl, in love
for the first time, with something very commonplace,
or perhaps crooked, like myself; endeavouring to
torture
her warped lover into beauty and proportion,
correspondent
with the heroes that she had read ofblind,
and deaf, and obstinate to every thing like conviction.
Thus, for a time too, he insisted on regarding me, as
grand, gloomy, and peculiar. I laughed at the notion.
I was neither gloomy, nor grand, by nature; nor willing
to follow the fashion of the day, and be
peculiar
, like
everybody that I knew. I had a character of my own,
as distinct, as that of the founder, of the grand and
gloomy order, Lord Byron himself:another had the
impudence to call me a good natured fellow enough.
Fool!had he known me better, he would have
charged
me with everything but good natureand have been
pretty cautious how he came near enough to me, to
form any opinion at all of me.
And once, when I was sitting with Wallace; and
he had wrought himself up to the belief, that he had a
great man in his room, I could not forbear,
maliciously
enough, too, I confess, to tell him what I
had been
with the steadiest emphasis, and particularity in the
world! His countenance grew paler and paler
trembled
paled
and lengthened at every sentence; and
he
kept changing his position, till, at last, he had nearly
turned his back upon me. It was a severe trial, I
confess
;
and I have never yet found one of my new and
violent admirers proof to it. One, a lady, who was
quite an enthusiast, for awhile, overwhelming me with
attention, was barely civil to me, after I
acknowledged
that I had, a few years before, lived in a shop, and
sold tea to her.
Wallace was a poeta fiery and intemperate one,
and capable of being one of the first. But, when I
knew him, he was labouring at the
trade
. I had
dabbled
in itgot some reputation, and found that mak
ing, what we call poetry, was only setting madness to
musick. And soperhaps, because people said that I
could notI abandoned it
did
abandon it, just as I
had abandoned my paintingand the armybecause
people thought that I could not. William Adams!-I could
do anythingwhere it depended upon myself. I can,
yet.
One evening, I was in his roomand he showed
me some stanzas, upon which he had been toiling for
two or three days. They were pretty; but full of faults;
and, when he demanded my opinion, I gave it freely,
frankly, honestly. He was quite sore under it, and
mortified
,
and begged
me
to write something. I could not well
refuse, you know; and I dashed off a few lines, which he
affected to relish exceedingly. I did not. I told him so; I
took them up, began to criticise them; and, in fact,
treated
my own verses worse than I had his. I attempted to
copy them, but I could not;and, finally, at the end of
a few minutes, I produced a fair
copy
, entirely different,
however, from the original, even to the measure, tone,
and thought. They were, really, very pretty and very
unintelligible.

The women, whether married, or about to be married, have,
what they call, a
quilting
, which corresponds exactly, with this.
They give notice, and prepare their tea, sweat meats and
mince-pies
;
and, in one afternoon, frequently, get a fine quilt entirely
completed
;
after which, the men are admitted; and then follow a little
dancing and romping
To give them greater value, I said,
vol. ii. D 2
as I laid down the pen. ThereI shall write no more
poetry.
Are you serious? said hetaking the cigar from
his mouth, and knocking the ashes from it, over the
edge of a wine glass, half full of old Madeira (for these
things were, emphatically, a part of his library.)
Perfectly
,
I replied.
Then you will have no objection to say so, in black
and white:offering to fill my glass
Not the leastno, no, I thank youI have drunk
one glass, to please you.
Only this oneit won't hurt you, said he.
NoI replied, not another drop.
Do me the favour then to write, under these lines,
(they had been written in the book of a fine girl that he
was then lovingafter the fashion of poets) that you
have done with poetry.
With all my heartI diddated the noteand
signed my name to it. A long time after this, he
begged
leave to dedicate a poem to me. I consented, on
condition that he should be very temperate. Soon
after
,
a manuscript came on to me, with a letter, praying
that I would dowhat
he
had not the patience to do
see the faults in it, and correct them. I was willing
to make him my friend, if he had the metal for it;
and, while I thought of the Bishop in Gil Blas, I went
about the work; and cut and slashed, into the very
heart of the manuscript;knowing, that, savage as it
appeared
that
was the only way of trying his
fortitude
.
The poem was printedbut he could not bear
it. He never spoke of it, though I pressed him
directly
and indirectly. At last, that, which he had
promised
to dedicate to me, came on, in manuscript. I read
it. It was a dark, taugled webof brilliancy and
shadow
but
without order and design. The colours
were richthe tissue goldenand, with a
proper
managementtapestry worthy of Heaven, and all
her stars, might have been woven out of itbut no! the
yarns were knotted and
snarled
. I told him so, and
returned it. It requires a stout heart, William Adams
to take such aliment, from one that you reverence,
as I offered him; but a stouter heart, and a bolder hand,
to offer it I did my dutyI drove the knife home
home to the vitals of the sufferer,determined to let
out the black pestilent humour, the thick, coagulated
blood; and save him, if I could. Months went by, and
no reply. I found it necessary to write, and to speak,
once for all very plainly. Months went by, again
and I received an answer. He had been sickeven
unto death, he said. That letter which you have by
you, is a copy of my last to him. It will show you
what I am.
I opened the letter, and read, as follows(it is still
in my possession.)
But for
your
sake, my dear Wallace, I should never
write to you another line. I had nearly come once to
the resolution, never to speak, nor think, nor write of
you again. You have been ill. I am sorry for it.
But the worst illness that you have, is one, of which,
whatever be the consequences. I am determined to
speak plainly.You want resolution, steadiness, and
resisting power.
But why do I tell you this? would I mock at your
misery? No. But I would tell you a plain truth,
while it is not yet too late. You are ficklefeeble of
heart; too easily elated; too easily depressed. You
forget me, probably the truest friend that you ever had,
or ever will haveand why? merely because, in
compliance
with your continual importunity, I took some
liberties with your poem; and you thought of playing
off a yet haughtier manner before me, because I
returned
another to you, with my sincere and honest opinion.
Do you want a flatterer, for a friend? You do. You
search for flattery, as for your natural aliment. You
are prodigal of it, to others. Your own good opinion
of yourself is not sustenance enough, for your
diseased
appetite. You crave that of fools, given to
repletion
and loathing; and quickened with a mortal poison,
which you mistake for pungency.
I speak plainly; and I wish it to sink deeply; for
God only knows whether I shall ever write to you
again. One effort I am willing to makeone, that
makes my heart heave and collapseit is for your good.
I am willing to forget all that has passed, on this plain
and easy condition, that, hereafter, you go steadily
about the work of
reformation
It will not be the work
of a week, nor a month, nor a year. But
begin
it.
make up your mind to it. I do not fear to deal thus
with you,
now
. But the time may come, when it would
be folly or crueltywhen I should either pity you too
much, or scorn you too much, for such an attempt. I
would not wound any human being; still less, one that
I have loved and respected in any degree, unless I
knew that it was
not
too late. With you, it
is
not.
Let me conjure you, Wallacelet me conjure you! with
tears in my eyes, to have done, forever, with
flattery
.
Teach your own heart to loathe it. In the next place,
let me pray you, never to ask another's opinion,until you
are prepared for its being unfavorable, and sure of his
honesty, at least; and then, though his opinion be
unpalatable
though
he be wrongfor that may well
be, sometimes; I pray you, treat
him
with respect,
however you may treat his
opinion
. And last of all; I
pray you; if you wish to be, what you may be, if your
ambition be of the right sortif it be not that childish,
brief passion for notoriety, which all young men of quick
sensibility, will feel at timesI pray you to
undertake
something, no matter what, for a livelihood
and name. Hold yourself aloof from the world.
Avoid it. Go to your room; use a regular and
temperate
exercise; rigid economy; and never emerge
never!
but to your grave, or to distinction.
You are yet young. The great world is before you.
Are you capable of this? You are. I
am
have
been
have
done
and am yet
doing
it; and I grow surer
and surer, every day, that I shall prevail at last. Yet
what
have
I; or rather, what
had
I, at your age, of evil
in my nature, that you have not?Nothing. I was as
capricious; sensitive; vain; ambitious, without aim or
object; as impatient of delay and restraint; and as
incapable
of brooking humiliation, however well or ill
merited. But, I have learnt some wisdom since; not
much; but
some
the profit of which, may be yours.
In the name then, of all that is lordly and beautiful
in man's nature, let me implore you. Wallace, to
undertake
this! Begin immediately; you have not an
hour to lose. Begin, and despair not.
You will
prevail
.
If you feel that you are able to begin, write to
me. I will treat you as ever; and not
revive
the
subject
.
If not, never let me hear from you again. I will
have no man for a friend, who is not capable of
this
.
And I have done with acquaintances. My
correspondence
is broken up. My professional business
employs
me, night and day. But, if you accept of my
condition, I shall remain your friend and
correspondent
.
Understand me. You do not know me, if you
believe
that I am to be thrown off, and whistled back
again, at pleasure. NoI know too well the value of
my own friendshipmy own value. I forgive you, for
your neglect of
me;
but I do not, and will not
forgive
you, for your neglect of
yourself
, your genius,
talent
,
and friend.
Do not be rash. You have time to think, before
you answer me. It is hard going back.
YesMr. Pullen has been here. We had but little
conversation, respecting you. But, I spoke very
plainly
.
As to his opinion of me; and the opinions of
all
,
who, eight months ago, thought humbly of me, you are
mistaken. I stand higher than ever, in their respect.
I
knew
it. I knew that I should, thenI said so. But,
they did not believe itit was thought vanity in me to
say soI bore it, though I was told, that nothing
which could possibly happen, during the lapse of many
years, would change the opinion of one person,
respecting
me. It was a rash word; and my heart was hot,
when I heard it. But, I have stood stilland they
have all done me justice, at last. Yesthe time has
already come, sooner, to be sure, than I thought; and,
though my folly and wickedness are not forgotten, yet,
other, and higher qualities have arisen in their stead
in a soil too, that might have been barren, for ever
for it was one of iron. This is the nature of things.
Upturn; or scorch; or trample down, the pestilent
herbage
of
your
heart, as I did that of
mine;
and you will
soon find healthier plants there; medicinal plants, that
might never have appeared, had not the soil been first
broken up, and fertilized by decay, corruption and
death. To be purified, we must pass through fire and
water.
What say you? Are you able to do this?to
endure
it? If yea, let me embrace you. We may yet
stand together, side by side, like brothers, an example
of what steadiness and resolution may effect, in spite
of the whole world.
You are under a mistake. Mr. Pullen never
refrained
from writing to meexcept for a little time
till he was master of his feeling. I drove him to it, as
I have youby a peremptory manner. I will not be
kept in suspense, where I have anything at stake.
Yours,
ALBERT HAMMOND.
P. S.Leave out the
Esquire
, in your address to
me.
I lifted my eyes, when I had finished the letter, and
started at the intenseness of Hammond's gazeour
faces
almost touched. His forehead was wrought, his
countenance lighted upand there was a cold,
intrepid
,
searching manner, in his aspect; without passion;
without tumult, vehemence or enthusiasm, that made
one feel strangely, very strangely, at the heart. You
will recollect that he was remarkably palewith very
bright eyesa profusion of loose hair, except just
upon
the top of his head, where he was quite baldso
that, his head looked larger; and his forehead much
broader than it was. The natural expression of his
face too, was very severebut the settled one, at this
time, was an artificial sternness and fixedness.
What think you now, of my friendship? said he.
Could you bear such a letter as that?
Yes, I replied;wondering at the
disproportionate
size of his head.
And what would you do? (never mind the size of
my head) pistol me, I suppose, off hand.
I beg your pardonIThat would depend upon
our intimacy. Pistol you! No. I would examine my
own heart. I would know
there
, if what you had said,
were true. If it wereI would bless you for it, and
put forth all my strengththough it killed mein one
continual effort to be great. If it were
not
and I
should soon know it, if it were notI would put your
letter by, and when you were upon your death bed
or I, upon mine, I would put it into your hands.
William Adams! cried the creature, leaping upon
his feet, and halting up to me
there is my hand!
from
this hour, let
our
friendship begin. It is not now, nor
do I pretend that it is, what it will be. I cannot love
you, all at oncenor, can you leap into my heart
that whirlpool of passion and wrathwithout some
preparation. You know me not---verily, I have a
devil
here---but, I have clipped his wings, I hope.
And made him---a
prisoner
, for ever!---said I.
Yes---but I have diluted his poison---and pared his
nails. I keep him now, only for such cattle as we met
to-day.
By the way, cried I---gasping for breath---I was
on the point of asking you---but I dared not.
Speak out. What is it?
Did not---I pray you, pardon me---did not the lash
touch you?
Did'nt it!---Why aye, I rather think it
did
. But,
you shall see. He rung the bell, and ordered the
servant
to get him a shirt.
By heaven, there was a red and blue welt, where the
whip had buckled round him, that girdled his waist,
like a swollen serpent.
Youyou I could not articulate, for some
moments
.
What shall you do to him?
What would you have me do?
Kill him....murder him....strangle him.
Upon my word, William Adams---Neck or
Nothing
rather. I am likely to have a precious
acquaintance
of you! Why should I
killmurderand
strangle
the poor devil? Have you any choice in the
matter
one
or allI am half ready to do your bidding.
But, seriouslyhas he not suffered terribly enough,
already, for stabbing me?
For stabbing you!yes. But not for
horsewhipping
you.
I'll tell you what, William Adams, said he, after
a moment of deep seriousness---there is something
wrong in your heart about this. Have you ever been
horsewhipped?
I---I!---Would you have me curse you to your face?
Well then, said he, all that I can say is, that
you are a dd incomprehensible fellow; and most of
a lunatick, when the world think you least of one.
What! You would have me kill a poor devil, outright,
merely because he horsewhipped me!
To be sure; said I---I would---though it were in
church.
Hurrah! for Walter Scott! cried Hammond---you
are of the gentry that,
Right their wrongs, wherever given,
In churches, or the court of heaven!
You appear indignant. A little more, and I shall
look to feel your knife in my side. But, soberly, my
dear William; this will never do. The age of blood
has gone by. Chivalry is done with. There are laws
and magistrates now. And we have so little
opportunity
of playing a brave part, or a great one, in our
limited
sphere of action, that, if it please you, for we are
henceforth to stand or fall together, in this world---we
will content ourselves with doing
good
---as the act
directs---as
humanity, and the law, and the Gospel---and
a Good God have commanded us---without bloodshed.
What say you to that?
I was strangely affected. His voice went through
my heart; and there was a deep movement, an inward
agitation there, as if he had been the first visiter, to its
best
place.
I embraced him---and forgot, as I did, that he was
so cursedly ugly of shape---that---no matter, let the
dogs bark at such men---they are regal creatures,
within their own dominions, of magnificent stature and
bearing---wherever their souls have room to stretch
their limbs, and walk abroad.
Upon my soul, I have seen that man, Albert Hammond,
on many occasions, but particularly on onewhen I
could have fallen upon my face, before him, and done
reverence to him, as the only true believer, in him, who
taught the doctrine of peace and long suffering, that I
had ever known. I remember the whole affair, as
well as if it was yesterday. We had been to a RAISING,
in New England.
A raising
, is the name there,
given
to a peculiar, rational frolick. Most of the people,
or nineteen twentieths of them, live in wooden houses.
And their mode of getting the frame put up, is what
they call, a RAISING. The frame of timber is prepared,
marked, and arranged; notice is then given, through
all the country, round about, that, on such a day, the
frame will be put up.
[3]
[3]
I have since found a copy of these linesyou will recollect that
they were the lastthe very last that Hammond ever wroteand
written, I am assured, precisely as it is related above; and, in
consequence
of much persuasion.
All the day and night before,
VOL. II. E
if it be in a part of the country, which is not very
populous
.Nay,
for several days and nights before,
scores and scores, of sturdy young men, would be seen,
flocking to the place; some on foot, and some on
horseback
and
some with their
teams
(by which they
mean
ox-teams
only, throughout New England; for
there you will hardly ever see a team of horses; and
here, by the way, it were well to mention that, in New
England, they do not drive their oxen with a whip, but
simply with what they call
a gourd
, meaning, probably,a
good
. It is a long, slender walnut stick, (about five
feet long, with a brad in the end, which they manage
with exceeding dexterity.) At last, the day dawns.
At day light, the tables are spreadciderbeer
metheglin
egg-popmeat(rum
or whiskey now, or
punch)pumpkin-piesand all,that the country affords,
may be seen lying about, under the trees, and upon the
grass, where a multitude of women and children are
assembled, The signal is given; and up go the joice,
timber and braces, in every direction, with the
celerity
of magick. The frame completely set up; and
sometimes boarded all over, and even clapboarded, or
shingled; and some refreshment taken, the rest of the
day is consumed in athletick; and, often in very
dangerous
amusementsof which, leaping, pitching quoits,
and shooting at turkeys, and poultry, are the principal,
with small rifle balls, sixty to the pound, scarcely
larger
than a buck shot. It is at these places, that the
champions of all the country round, are sure to
assemble
;
and wo to the man, that prevails in the wrestling
ring. There is no peace with him, for the rest of his
days. He is bound to contend with all who may offer;
like the champion of England, not only on the day of
his victory, but at every other day, wherever he may
be. It was on one of these occasions, that I saw
Hammond
,
who had been a silent spectator of the scene, for
a long time, without opening his mouth, suddenly set
upon by a brutal wretch, a little in liquor, who, in
retreating
from a pair of wrestlers, trod upon
Hammond's
foot. Some little altercation followedduring
which, the man was too abusive almost for human
patience
;till,
at last, Hammond had become the
laughing
stock of all the boys about. I could hardly help
enjoying
it, I confess; and yet my blood boiledcoward
as I waswhen I saw the looks of the dwarf. He
was deadly paleabsolutely whitebut not so much,
from anger, as from inward strife. At last, the man
collared him.What was the consequence? Nothing
but thisHammond buckled his long, lithe arms, with
the swiftness of a black snake, about his waist
knuckled
his back, till his head and heels almost touched; and
laid him down, gently, upon the grassamid the most
deathlike stillness that I ever saw. It was near
nightfall
but
from that moment, the sports were over; and
the people separated on the spot, drunk or sober; and
every man went his way, as if he had seen the devil.
Nobody knew him; and nobody stepped forward, as
had been the custom, for ever, on such occasions
to try a fall with him, when he had thrown the man,
whom we found after, to have been, for years, the
bully
of all the country round.
I should have killed him. But Hammond merely
put him down, as if he pitied him. Yet, I was weak;
and Hammond had the strength of a ring-tailed
panther
,
or an ourang outang, whom by the way,he much
resembled
:
nay, I have seen him wrestle with a bear, and
prevail tooalmost to the tearing of the animal's jaws
asunderthough it was not quite grown, I confess.
Then, there is what they call a
Husking
, which is confined to the
New England states, (the legitimate Yankee population,) for, at the
South, the blacks do the business After the corn, not what the
English call cornbut Indian corn is got in; the men and women,
young and old, assemble together, night after night, at each others
housesand tear the husks off from the corn, and weave it, by one
or two remaining upon each ear, into large bundles, when required;
or leave it in heaps to dry, in the garner or barn. It is at these
Husking-frolicks, that most of what may be called
fun
, is to be met
with in this country. The girls rompand laughand sing, with
all their heart and soul, as if to shew the yeomanry what they would
do, if they were wivedlawfully. But there is no
bundling
in New
England. That is confined, if it exist at all,
now
, to Pennsylvania,
New Yorkand to the Dutch and German settlers, or their
descendants
.
And even with those, it is wonderful how little advantage can be
taken of it. I have an intimate frienda painter, of great talent
who was invited to bundle with a very pretty girl, at a house where
he staid, in travelling, by her own mother. He was amazed; but
consented, of course. The girl, contrary to what he looked for
did not undress. She only threw off her outer loose gownshe
was young and wildbut he assures me, and I believe himthat
the girl would not, and did not, permit him to take any liberties
whatever, with her, except such as he might have taken with any
country girl, in open day light, without reproachas kissing and
hugging, for instance; and, that whenever he grew troublesome, she
cried out, or threatened toand the house was full of people, who
would have received any insult, as a breach of honor and decency.
Such is custom!

I will!the light that beams from thee,
Burning in hallowed purity,
To poetsis pure poetry,
And inspiration too!
What then?though I may often swear
To write no moreI can't forbear,
When playing round thy lids, I see
That light of sweet sincerity,
That light of tearful blue
AwayawayI'll sing to thee
Whate'er may be my destiny

So thou wilt lighten while I sing.
On looking at them againI begin to lose my patience.
Wallace
has made the publick so familiar with his imitations of
Hammond
,
that, even to my own eye,
they
look like imitations of
him
.
To me, there is nothing left of their original freshness, to atone for
the violent nonsense of a poet. Howeverthere they are.

Hamlet.
Pray
, said Elizabeth, to Hammond, as we all sat
together, the very first evening that he appeared below,
his lovely hostess, in a loose wrapper, and in a most
captivating
humour. Pray, answer me two or three
questions
more about that insolvent law.
O, noin mercyno!Let us have no agrument
to night, said Mrs. H, Come, come, you
are an invalide, you know; and all our arrangements
are made---wrangling aside---for a lively, cheerful
evening
.
I looked up in her face, while she spoke. Her voice
was melody itself; but there was a littlea very little
affectation in it:yet, nevertheless, not forgetting a
dash of coquetry, and an occasional sally of the eye,
showing a familiarity, with early and uninterrupted
dominion
.She
was a singularly beautiful, and engaging
woman for her age.
Nay, Miss Adams; remember that I
am
an invalide.
Let your questions be few, or some of my blood vessels
may give way; for Mrs. H. I perceive, by her eyes,
look!is foraging already, in our cantonment of
hearts. We shall soon be brought to battle.
You mentioned something of
analogy
, in our last
conversation. I have looked a little into the matter,
since I saw you, said Elizabeth.
Shall I tell you why? said Hammond,
interrupting
her.
If you please.
Because I flattered you. It turned your head.
Elizabeth colouredbut there was less of anger, than
of surprise, in the expression of her face.
Upon my word! said she, I cannot deny it. But,
you have taught me,
by that remark
, how to estimate
your compliments.
He was touchedI could perceive
that
for his lips
trembled, and his brows worked, as he replied. Pray,
what were you saying of
analogy
?
I would have saidbut for your timely interference,
which prevented me from
exposing
myself--
Nay
now, you are angry with me!
Nonot
angry
, she replied.
But
hurt
, I suppose. Well, well, let me have it.
Prove to me, that you are
not
angry. If you are not,
you will proceed.
Elizabeth recovered her good humour immediately
and continued. Where is the
analogy
, of which you
spoke, to justify your opinion, that each state, had
the power to pass an insolvent law!
Othere is no longer any question about
that
, you
know.
That
is admitted. The supreme court, does
not deny it. But what is an insolvent law? That is
the point. I say, that it is a law, protecting the
citizens
of that state, and no other, where it is passed; and
not interfering with any other state. I find sufficient
analogy for this doctine, in the concurrent powers of the
general government, and the individual governments.
Each may pass laws for the punishment of crime: each
has had, and may still have naturalization laws:and
each has the right of levying
taxes
. But, observe, in
every case, this power of the state, must be limited,
not only, so as to operate
exclusively within its own
jurisdiction
,
but so, as not to interfere, in any way, with the
neighbouring states.
No evil
can
arise, where no interference can take
place, of this nature; and it cannot, under a state
insolvent
law, whatever be its provisions.
Very well. I think that I can understand that;
continued Elizabeth. But, what of the
policy
of the
law. What of imprisonment for debt?
One word of the latter, first. If a man will
contract
to be imprisoned, it is all very well. In one way
or other, it will be effectual at last. But, it is a useless
VOL. II. E 2
and barbarous remedyan effectual one. I admit; but
so would torture be. I hope that it will be abolished,
in this county; and I do not doubt that it will. It has
been in every civilized people upon this earth, by one
qualification and another. And what will be its
consequence
,
here? This, and this only. The creditor,
if he think the risk greater,
without
the right of
imprisonment
,
than
with
it, will charge a higher price for
his merchandise. That will be all. We shall protect
ourselves
then
, by enlarging the premium or profit, a
rate of interest, till it weigh down the risk. You can
make a contract now, that you shall
not
be imprisoned;
but, you must pay in proportion. You will do no more,
when imprisonment for debt is abolished.
Of the policy of an insolvent, or bankrupt law, I
have little to say. It is, emphatically, a national
blessing
.
Look into the history of all the nations of the
earth. Just exactly, in proportion to their commercial
importance, has always been the liberality of their
insolvent
and bankrupt law, toward the honest debtor.
In England, they punish the fraudulent one, with
death; but allow the honest one, a support for his
family
,
in the shape of commission. In France, they send
the first to the gallows, and the latter to the Elysian
fields.
Without it, you make slaves of them, that God hath
afflicted. Observe what I say. Make a fraudulent
bankruptcy criminal. But punish it, as you do other
crimeswith severity, in proportion to the difficulty of
proof, and the greatness of the temptation. But,
before
you punish, let the guilt of the offender be
formally
established. At present, a large part of our most
valuable population; enough, I
know
, if they would
confederate, to shake the union to her foundation, if not
to a dismembermentmen of wisdom and experience
literally schooled in adversity, are left in a condition
more deplorable than our slaves. They have no right
to propertytill they have paid all their debts; but how
many can ever do that? Their slavery descends to
their posterityin the worst shape; they are unable to
to educate themand are made to entail ignorance,
poverty, and wretchedness upon them. Their liberty
is not their ownnay, nor their lives; for they may be
immured, their young hearts beating for valorous
achievementand left, to rot away, piecemeal, in a
prison house, worse than any grave; for they can look
out of it, and see others walking about, unfettered; they
can
hear
too; and the musick of men's affairs, the
voices
,
of the free, and hearty, and happy, torture them, like
the taunting of devils.
Hundreds and hundreds of human creatures lie idle;
for, they
cannot
worknobody will trust them; or
will
not workmerely that their sweat and blood may not be
counted out, drop by drop, to their task mastersto
undergo a transmutation, in their sweltering hearts
to gold. But nono!I will not think of these things.
The time has not yet come. But, by the living God!
if there were a few such men, as our fathers were, they
would soon find a Canaan and a Joshua. We would go
out, from among the Egyptians, and form an empire of
our own! DastardsDastards! These insolvent
debtors
would stand by, I do believe, and see their wives and
daughters profaned; and their children made into mince
pies, for thanksgiving dinners, to their patrician lords,
without lifting their hands.
But suppose that a natural bankrupt law should be
passedor a law, protecting the
person only
, of
insolvent
debtorsthat isa law compelling a man to be a
scoundrel, under the penalty of starvation;for how can
he get any propertyhow support himself, if nothing
be left to himand his earning, for a time be not
protected
?(when
his
nest egg
is taken from him every
morning) unless he became a rogue?
What would be the consequence? This, and this
only. People would protect themselves more carefully
by their contractsdemand higher profits, prices, or
interest; or security. This accursed evil would then
pass away, for ever.
Judge Marshall grants to each state, the power of
passing a statute of limitation. Give them
that;
and
what more do they want? They may, as
effectually
,
shelter
the insolvent, by that, as by any law of insolvency. It
would be only necessary to pass a law, declaring that
certain contracts should not be available at all, after a
certain
event
had arrived, unless judgment were
obtained
before, which judgment should be good only, till
another
event
should happen. Why may not this event
be insolvency? Such is the law, in relation to
judgments-on
simple contracts--it is precisely
that
. I see little
difficulty in it. There is no reason why an
event
that
operates as a limitation, may not become a
rule of
pleading
, as well as a
period of time
, which is so
called
,
because it so operates.
Or suppose thatfor, several of the states, profiting of
his hint, that they may make such
rules of pleading
as
they please, have done so-suppose that a state should pass
a law, not for
staying execution
, as they call it, for
one, two, or three yearsbut to all eternity. If they
have a right to do the onethey have a right to do the
other. And why not go further?and say that, in
certain cases (which may correspond with our
insolvent
cases) no execution at all shall issue?
Would this be impairing the
obligation
of contracts?
Certainly not; for Judge Marshall says; and he is
supported
by Lord Mansfieldthat the
obligation
of a
contract
is one thing; the
remedy
another. A state may
regulate the
remedy
at her own discretionbut she may
not, and shall not touch the
obligation!
I like these distinctions. They save a thick headed,
plain man abundance of trouble. Soinstead of
quarrelling
with Judges Marshall and Mansfield, about
definitions
;
I will only say to the state authority:
Protect
me, as you have a right to do, against the
remedy;
and the devil may take the
obligation
. Just, give me a
rule of pleading
, by which my creditor shall not be
permitted
to meddle with me for the next fifty, or one
hundred
years; and I will give you no trouble about the
obligation
.
I have done.
Upon my word, I am glad of it! cried Mrs.
Honeywell
,
rubbing her eyes, and yawning. You say a
great deal about Lord Mansfieldis Lord
Chesterfield

Lord!how I should like to see you

Nopositivelynonever.
But you made it before hand?or have said it

She nodded, and laughed.
I could have sworn it, said Hammond, by your
blundering about the
butter
so long. You meant to
make a pun of that too, I suppose. What was it?
I forgetit
slipped
through my fingers.
Ha, ha, ha!you are incorrigible. I see plainly.
Your last visit to Philadelphia has spoilt you, utterly.
I began to have some hopes of you, till then. We must
send you to CambridgeHarvardthere is a man
there, who puns in the pulpitin his prayers. I have
heard him.
I looked at Hammond with astonishment. How
came it that he was such a favourite, and with
beautiful
women too?He never flattered then. He was
abrupt
,
loud, and imperious. Yet they bore with him,
ugly as he was. They seemed to forget that he was a
dwarf. How natural he was! With what an air of
readiness and sincerity.with what a heart, he said
every thing, even the most trivial! Where had he learnt
to trifle so gracefully? It is the most difficult thing in
the world, I have heard, to do it,without lessening
one's own dignity. Yet
he
did it; and there was such
an agreeable raciness, pungency, flavour and juiciness
in what he saidthat indeed. I can well understand
now, what a woman of great wit and accomplishment,
once said to me; that the nonsense of a great mind was
more tolerable, than the good sense of an ordinary one.
It is so. We love to see straws and violets handled
gracefullythough they
be
handled by a strong man,
in armour.
I saw Elizabeth whispering to Mrs. Honeywell
just after thisand heard her say, provoke him
bring him outWilliam does'nt know himwe are all
alone, you know. Do,
do!
Mrs. H. nodded; and a few moments after, began
to quote poetry. Her manner was happy; her memory
good; and one of her old friends, a maiden lady, of
strong understanding, but too abrupt and decided in
the expression of her likes and dislikes, sat near her
and cut in, now and then, herself. Let us tie up the
bell, said the latter,(her name was Miss Emmitt,)---
and make ourselves at home this evening.
Lest some of your
favourites
may intrude? said
Mrs. H. spitefully, I thought.
Upon my word, said Hammond, I feel a
presentiment
,
that the Frenchman, to whom you were so rude
or the lawyer, whom by the way, you do not
understand
,---the
creature of your abhorrence and
detestation---will
.
The
reptile!
---answered Miss Emmitt, with a
scornful emphasis.
Allow me, said Hammond, turning about and
facing
her-- allow me, to do that man justice. You are
disposed to underrate him. He is no fool; no
reptile;
---
he is a man of sound, homely, good sense; and a good
heart. Believe me---I know him.
You do not know, I am sure that you do not, the
reason of my dislike;---the contemptible creature!
Nay, Miss Emmitt---
that
is unworthy of
you---beneath
you. It
proves
that you do
not
think him
contemptible
,
when his very name disturbs you---(with
passion
, he would have added---but---he stopped short
---and his eyes dwelt, for a moment, upon her face, so
steadily, that the colour mounted there.)
If you knew
I do know it, continued Hammond, interrupting
her. He behaved in a shameful manner. It was
unpardonable
.
But you owe it to your own dignity, not
to show that you were outraged by it.
Then you do know---who told you?---Mrs.
Honeywell---or
Mrs. Carter---or Miss Julia.
It was purely, accidental;---and, upon my word, I
have forgotten
who
told me.
No---you are unwilling to tell me.
Miss Emmitt!
said Hammond, with great dignity.
I understood him; and the blue eyes of Mrs.
Honeywell
,
dashed abroad for a moment, with a sort of ma
licious pleasantry. Elizabeth sat near her; and their
arms, I observed, were intertwined---a little of that
sweet coquetry, which beautiful women, when they are
in the presence of men, are never utterly without----
caressing and affectionate---they prepare our hearts,
inwardly
,
for the nourishment of those silken tendrils
that, if torn, will bleed for ever---when they shall once
have been knitted to us.
Hammond was in the opposite corner; I, in the
middle
,
so situated, that I could see the working of every
countenance about me, without being seen. Over my
head, burnt a beautiful lamp like thin moonlight---the
milky coloured globe on the top, shedding a pale
vapour
,
as if it were a great pearl, with a lamp of
revolving
fire in the centre.
I took a survey of the company; and, leisurely,
entered
their features upon my memory. First, there was
Hammond, his great, pale, swarthy face, under the
shadow
of the mantle piecehis broad knotted forehead
written all over, with phenomena, like the skywith
the annals of God: his long lithe arms, folded and
intertwined
,
as if there were no bones in them; and one
of his ugly legs drawn up so, that, at times, his knee
almost touched his chin. His eyes were nearly shut;
and they were vivid and fearfulterriblewhen he
opened thembut about his mouth, there was an
expression
of intense beauty, that all feltbut none could
account for. It was the terrour of his wrought lip;
the deep, and instantaneous electricity of his thought;
the sallying out of his imagination;and the bold,
strange eloquence of his heart, that issued there
that
it was, which made his mouth the rallying point of all
eyes and thoughts.
In the opposite corner, was Elizabethher delicate,
undulating figure wrapped up in the ugliest shawl
as
I'm alive
, that was ever worneven by a fashionable
woman:her countenance, full of anxiety and
expression
but
subdued;her hair, profusely, and
negligently
wound up, like dark coloured, rough gold
upon her finely turned head,her blue-veined hand
covering
her temples; and half buried, in the loose,
abundant
hair. She was leaning upon the arm of the sofa
and when she spoke,it was seldom indeed
that
night
, it was in an unknown tongue. I knew her not
the action of her mind seemed to be suspendedthe
substance dissipated. It was all flavour tone,
beauty
colour
and essence.but without body. Twice
when she was most forgetful, there was a timid and
strange movement of her eyes, toward the opposite
corner
as if their haughtiness had been, some day or other,
rebuked there. They
were
haughtythat's the truth on't
even when down-cast:and shed, even through the
shut, cowering lids, a sort of intellectual light, that,
with the sweet wisdom of her mouth, a fellow would
be very unwilling to disturb idlyI should think.
And once too, when Hammond was in all the heat
and hurry of his mind, during an accident, which I shall
just mention. I caught her eyes rivetted upon him, with
an expression that alarmed meI know not why:I
should have said that it waslike jealousy, if
Elizabeth
had not been my sister,or envy, perhaps; but I
do not know. The sensation was death like, quick and
hotlike the sting of a little serpenta sickness and
scalding at the heart, and a trouble in my blood. She
saw me looking at herand coloured all over;and
her delicate fingers played, with an agitated, incessant,
involuntary activity, for some minutes after, among the
dim tufted gold upon her white temples. Hammond
toohad he seen it?his teeth were set,his glittering
white teeth, and his red lip, writhed bitterlyBut---
let me describe the others. Our number, in a little
while, had augmented to seven, or eight; but, as they
came in, one after the other, during the debate, I
mention
it now, that I may not be taken off, by and by, when
I am better employed, by repeating the conversation
that followed. I wish to do it accurately; and, I believe,
that I canto the very wordsfor never did any thing
of the sort make such a distinct impression upon me.
Everything that Hammond uttered, fell, as if it were
weighty and hot, upon a heart of wax; and sunk
deeper
and deeperat every sobtilltillno matter
for the rest. You understand metill
their
most
worthless
tablets became heavy with
his
thought, without
their suspecting itpregnant with his
spirit
, believing
it their own,rich, with the melted ore that
he
had
poured into them, with a prodigal hand, without (for
they saw that it did not impoverish
him
)
thankfulness
,
that it enriched them.
Next to Elizabeth, reclining, like Cleopatra, in her
barge, was Mrs. Honeywell; a lightly wreathed
turban
,
like drifted snow, wound about her beautiful
forehead
,
and dark, glossy hair; her blue eyes, young and
passionate as ever; and lips, even in their
over-ripeness
,
shedding a warm and voluptuous exhalation.
Next to her, sat one of her two daughters; a fair
haired
,
noble looking girlwith a superb person, tranquil,
blue eyes; a most beautiful neck; a sweet, red mouth;
and a mild, doubtful, uncharacterised, but amiable
manner. She had a newspaper in her hand.
What is the meaning of that? said she; reaching it
to me. I cannot understand it.
It was the census of the United states. I told her,
looking at a part of the sheet, where I thought her eyes
directed.
No, noI do not mean
that
. I know that. But
where am I to look, for thethe
For the
total?
said I
there
it isthere, by your
hands...nine millions, and
What!nine millions in Philadelphia
is it
possible
!
(Her eyes were upon the word Pennsylvania.)
O, no; said I. Nine millions in the whole
United
states.
Is it possible!
said she, in the same tone of
astonishment
,
precisely!
The population of our
city
, is not mentioned here;
said I. It is, I believe, however, somewhat over one
hundred thousand.
VOL. II. F
Is it possible!
she exclaimed.
I looked at her, in astonishment. She had just been
amazed, that there were nine millions in the city; and
was, now, just as much amazed, to find one hundred
thousand. I smiled, and spoke of it afterward, to
Hammond. You cannot easily understand that
woman
;
said he. She has a noble, and feeling heart;
but, she has been spoiled by her mothera coquette,
without knowing it; great good sense; and a quick,
but deep and hidden sensibility, which she, herself, is
ignorant of. Her observations were perfectly natural.
I know the very tone and look, with which they were
made. She has caught them of her mother; a
remarkably
well bred woman, who is
mightily
apt to
anticipate
your thought; and answer, without
understanding
itnot because she
cannot
understand it
but, because her mind is away. Her daughter,
amiable
and mild, like her mother, is sometimes playful and
witty; but,
not
like her mother, she wants practice, and
experience. It takes a longer time, to make a well
bred woman, or man, than people generally imagine.
Children do well enough, to stand up with, in a
cotillion
party; but, if you are to parade a ball room, or
walk about, in the presence of majesty, your only
companion
is the gentleman, or lady, of the last century.
Gracious heaven! how unlike, in their courtly ease,
superb
self possession, and stately promptitude, to the
ribald patch-work gentry of the present day; compare
the graceful impudence, and easy trifling, of the old
school, with the awkward pawing, and pleasantry of
the new. I cannot endure the latter; and, for that
reason
,
I never go into what is called good company, or
well-bred society, unless it be into that of the well bred,
of the last generation but one. I hate your loud,
vociferous
merrimentyour unmeaning tartnessyour
lubberly easeyour starch formality; at parties, for
example, with powdered black footmen; such, as I have
seen taken from the plough, set into shoes, like wooden
dishesand employed in carrying round, not a loaded
waiter of turnips and beets, carved into the shape of
cauliflowers, and white and red rosesbut each one,
with his great sprawling, cracked hands, a single
sugar-bowl
one
of white, another of brown. No
curse such flummery, I say.
Next to this daughter, was another; a younger one;
utterly unlike her sister, in person, heart, and
character
;
a sour looking, pale faced, thin girl; with a
spiteful
,
old-maidish expression in her eyesand a great
sharpness of tonestaidstiffrudeimpudent and
busy; with a singularly quick, active, and good mind;
but, destitute of sensibility, originality, charity,
enthusiasm
,
and sweetness of temper. Had she been
properly
disciplined; and properly whipped, now and then,
before her frowardness had become established; or her
bad temper, so very acrimonious, as it was, unless
continually
soothed and flattered, she might have been
made into something like a superiour woman. I have
seen her, when she was quite an interesting girlfor
a single moment;when the tears were starting into
her eyesand the blood was lighting up her fine
forehead. And I have known her to say, not only
some tart and pleasant, but some really witty things.
The best part of her character, however, was her
regard
to the truth. She had a great deal of probity and
moral courage; and she was the only one of the whole
family, that had any at all; and, if she were actually
in loveas I do believe that she might beit would
sweeten her temper, change her whole constitution,
physical and intellectual; till, I dare say, she might
hope to die a much happier woman, and a much fatter
one. Her sister was rather pleasant and
companionable
.
She would bleed at the heart, if she had hurt
another
,
even by accident. But this one, without any
evil disposition, would be very likely, if not awed at
once, to carry a stain away upon her weapon, even
while playing with it.
I remember once having met with one of these good
natured, credulous, unthinking women, like the other
sister, who, when I had ended a sally of extravagance,
in which I had been maintaining, that young
terrapins
,
which the people of the country ate, sometimes, alive,
were neither more nor less, than negro babies, with
shells on.
O, Mr. Adams! cried the girl, lifting her hands, and
looking me innocently, up in the facehow you talk!
you will never make me believe that!
The elder of these daughters might have said the
same thing, a few years before: and so might the
youngerbut if
she
had said it, so different would
have been her tone, that you could never have mistaken
it. It would have been witty in onechildish
inattention
,
or surprise in the other.
Next to her, was a beautiful child, who, the chief
part of the evening, had kept her little eyes, upon the
knotted joints; and rough, hairy skin; and ridgy nails
of the Dwarf's hand, that lay upon the table near her.
Nayin the very heat of his discourse, while she was
touching it, just as she would a pet toadand
whispering
about it, to one of the ladies, Hammond let
it lie there, just as if it had belonged to somebody
else.
Beside these, there was a woman, of whom I have
already spoken, a proud masculine creature, with
a powerful understanding, and full of high blood
independent
and strong of thought; fearless and bitter.
She was called Miss or Mrs. E. I liked her
afterward
;
I had many reasons for it; for she flattered me,
continually; and flattery, from a strong minded woman
of any age, though not
very
adroitly
administered
,
is apt to lull the dragon of the worst heart.
But
then
I did not like herI would as soon have
encountered
a woman with mustachoes, as one that dared
to say, to men, what I have heard her say to men; and
what had
she
been a man, she would have been run
through the body for.
There was another; a French woman, with a plump,
round, beautiful personstill youthfulgraceful
spiritual
with
a handsome faceremarkably
intelligible
eyes---lofty heart---familiar with the best society of
the European courts; and at
home
, in her spirit of
accommodation
,
wherever she was.
And there were two gentlemen of the bar there; one
a small man, with a pleasant, mild countenance; and a
singularly chaste, amiable, and clear mindmodest,
retiring, yet strong of heart and high of purpose; and
another, the mortal antipathy of Miss E. a mild, pious,
unassuming man, who, for his quiet unobtrusiveness,
was prodigiously apt to be underrated.
Such was the company that, before it was time to
separate, for the night, had collected in the parlour.
Mrs. Honey well, as I have already said, with a
spiteful
disposition to bring Hammond out, had begun to
lavish her playfulness all about, like one flinging light
and vapour from a censer.
Hammond sat, thoughtfully, studying the
countenance
of the child, that I mentioned, as if, already, he
could see her red lips blackening; her delicate
transparency
sullied, with the calamities of life:the fierce
light of his orbs, waned, quiveredand the lids filled;
but, just then, his thought was forced back, by a
violent
convulsion, like one that starts broad awake, from a
terrible dream, by the stopping of his own heartjust
as if a ball had passed through it.
What was that? said he, that quotation.
Mrs. Honeywell had just been quoting a phrase that
struck on his eareven in its abstraction, like a knife.
The ravelled sleeve of careshe answered.
The what!pray, what do you mean by it?
Mean! why it is Shakspeare, you know.
I know no such thing, I assure you.
What! you don't read Shakspeare, I suppose. You
throw him aside, with the
lumber
and
rubbish
of old time
the
classicks
.
No, pardon me; I
do
read Shakspeare; but I do
not
quote
him; and I scorn to remember the trash
even of Shakspeare. I cannot pardon,
will
not
tolerate
,
nonsense in
him
.
How dare you!
you!
you will not tolerate or
pardon
Shakspeare! Would that he might appear to you!
he and Johnson, and Milton, and.
Would heaven (not would
to
heaven.) they might!
Aye, that they sat there

, upon that seat, at this
momentwhat! are you alarmed!they would agree
with methey would say, that
Well done!
Why you would not dare to touch the
hem of Shakspeare's garment
you!
vol. ii. F 2
Would'nt I! I should tremble and sweat in his
presence
I suppose!nonsenseWilliam Shakspeake,
himself
,
would laugh at our ridiculous, and indiscriminate
enthusiasm;aye, laugh at us, for our veneration of his
nonsense. Do you believe that he would permit any
one of his plays to survive his indignation, if he could
hear it read, now?No, he would trample them all
in the dust.
You dare not surely reprobate his
plays?
Dare I not? Listen to me. I dare to do more. I dare
to say, and to prove it. I dare to give my reasons for
it. I dare to say, that he never wrote a play, which
would be tolerated upon the English stage, if it were to
come out now;
now
, for the first time, from an unknown
author?
O, blasphemy! why have they been so worshipped.
Why does he hold such sway over all our natures?
Why is he so followed and imitated? Why has there
never been such another genius since?
Never such another genius!
There
is
there
has been
, many a one, his match,
in genius: many, superior to him in dramatick talent
why worshipped? Because an army of commentators,
criticks, and actors, have swarmed out of his
corruption
and fire; and become partakers in his
immortality
.
His
immortality!
I thought that he had no genius.
NoI have said no such thing. No human being
had ever more genius than he; and none ever had more
reverence, for his genius, than I have, It is
that
, which
makes my blood boil, when I hear his name mentioned
in this way. Shakspeare, himself, would be indignant
at it. You would read him, as you acknowledged to
me once, that you read the biblethrough and through,
again and again, from a
sense of duty;
though you did
not pretend to understand some of the chapters, you
said. Tut! You might as well have read it in the
original
Hebrew or Greek. Shakspeare is the god of the
unthinking. His dramas, are their bible; his
blundering
ignorance, their unimpeachable gospel. He wrote
without design; an uneducated, rash man; full of
thunder
and tempest; wind and flame; musick and
brightness
;joying
to emit them all, in his own way. He
struck off his impressions at a blast; never believing in
their valuenever caring for them; beginning his
dramas
without any outline; too lazy to look back; or to
read over; or remember, what he had once written; and
therefore, blundering continually; but, even in his
blunderinglike a giant, stumbling over mountains
supplying his own forgetfulness, by violent and
crowded
incident, unnecessary characters, and setting at
naught all the laws of the drama. Why? Not because
he was above them; but because he was ignorant of
them. Had it not been so, he would have outraged
them, with a bolder hand; like one that crushes an
enemy
with his mailed foot,
knowingly;
or respected them
for they deserved itto a certain extent. His mind
was a treasury of precious things; musical instruments,
shattered and broken; and coloured, brilliant, burning
imagery; but all in disorder. Hence their rapidity, are
splendour of his mental operations; they were
perpetually
revolving phenomena; a mental kaleidoscope,
where the greater the disorder, the more multiplied,
beautiful, and varied, are the combinations. But, all
that he has done, is consecrated. By heaven, if the
cursedest nonsense that was ever coined, had been
trumpetted about, century after century, as his hath
been; studied, all the while, by men whose only hope of
immortality consisted, in finding, or imagining, some
secret, deep intention, in his veriest gossipping, that
all others had overlooked; it would be hallowed, at this
moment, like his. O, how he would laugh, were he
living
now, at your veneration for parts, that
never
had
any meaning in them!parts, it is ten to one, taken
from his loose manuscriptfrom scraps of paper, where
he had merely tried his pen! How little of it would he
endure at this moment! How much significance had
been hunted out; how much spirit distilled; how much
mysterious depth of meaning imagined, by actors and
criticks! O, he would wonder at his own Hamlet,
could he see it performed, at this hour!
I have heard it said, that Garrick understood
Shakspeare, better than Shakspeare understood
himself
,
said Mrs. H.
That would be nonsense, madam. Yet, I do not
doubt, that the creatures of Shakspeare
his
Richard,
Othello, and Hamlet, for examplewere utterly unlike
the Richard, Othello, and Hamlet, of the stage. Every
actor has his own conceptions of the part. It is for
others, to say which is the best and truest. The
original
is only an apparition; and, it is likely, that he, who
first called it up, by his tremendous sorcery, and taught
it language, saw with as clear an eye, and as
understanding
a heart, what were its attributes, as they that
have conjured it up, again and again, at second hand,
by their baby incantations, out of book, till it has
become
an automaton, practised to move and talk, after
a certain fashion, when regularly dressed, interrogated,
set, and wound up.
But Shakspeare, madam, like other men, has
blinded
himself, sometimes, by dashing too heedlessly among
the stars. What think
you?
Is he an example for a
dramatist? You speak of Garrick's veneration for
him. Garrick has left the best proof, in the world, of
his
veneration, by the manner in which he has garbled
every drama of Shakspeare's, that he touched. Not
one of them, however, even yet, could a modest woman
read aloud, in company; not one
ought
she to sit out,
upon the stage; and yet it is the Bible of your libraries;
nay, to be found, where no Bible
is
-to be found; ready,
with its poison and death, for the unstained hand, and
unpolluted breast, of every child; and so spoken of,
that it is more terrible blasphemy, to speak as I have
spoken of it, to-night, than so to speak of the Bible.
What are our children to think of such things? Do
you hope that they will pass over what shocks and
thrills themlike brilliant little serpents, nestling, in
the way to their bed roomupon their dressing tables
without any sensation, either of loathing or horrour,
or fascination. Which is most likely? They are trained
to regard Shakspeare, as the unapproachable one,
whose web of rainbow and beauty, drenched with flame,
and sprinkled with blood, is little else than the
wayward
,
unsteady weaving, of one wasteful of his mate
rials, and drunk with genius;the great gossipping of
one, whom, on account of his lonely beauty at one time;
and passionate conception at another, we cannot
reprobate
,
even when he deserves our united malediction.
Your moralityshame on your independence!shame
too upon your decency!
You wonder at my presumptionI can see that you
do. You think that no such genius as Shakspeare hath
ever lived. Yet, what did he?look at his dramas
I can recollect but two, where there is one master
passion
,
delineated with a steady eye, throughout. One is
jealousyOthello; and even there, we are not certain,
that jealousy
is
the master passionand the play is
damnableunnaturalbeastly. Another is
love
Romeo
;
and so utterly hath he failed there, that, to this
hour, men are in doubt of the authorship. In all the
others, there are compounded passions; a variety of
characters; violent, ridiculous and huddled incidents,
showing the labour of an inexperienced mind, ignorant
of its own power---incapable of hoarding its riches---
lavishing, immediately, whatever came in his way,
however
fooolishly; lest, when he wanted, it might not be
found,---and making up for his ignorance, by startling
transitions---stage trick, indecency, buffoonery, and
contradiction. Madam, you think that no man has
written
like Shakspeare. You are mistaken. You ask who
ever wrote like him. I answer---nobody---or nobody
but Ireland. Yet it were very easy. He did---a mere
boy too---and succeeded so, that the criticks were
cheated
.
I could do the same---I could write a play, that
criticks would swallow for Shakspeare's
.
Hush! hush!said Mrs. Honeywell,colouring
to the eyeswith pity and consfernation
I understand you, continued Hammondleaning
toward her, and smiling,I am not madyet, I
would undertake to write a play, in forty-eight hours
after I had got a few materials ready,that should
pass for Shakspeare's.
The tears almost filled her eyes. She was
ashamed
and terrified, at his earnestness; and, while she
blushed
,
for him, to her very heartshe would have
prevented
him from exposing himself.
But nohe repeated it. You think that I am vain
I do not blame you. I do not wonder at it. Again
and again, I have been told so. Yet, it does not change
my opinion, one jot or tittle of myself. I know what I
say. I believe that I could do it. I repeat itthough
it pain you, to show you, that it was not said merely in
the heat of contradiction. NoI have done with that.
Yetbelieve me, I thank you for your compassionate
feeling. You would prevent me from making myself
ridiculous. It was kind in youand, though I have no
fear that I could be so
in any case
still I thank you.
Many persons have said to me, that I was mador
insufferably presumptuous and vain; yet my own hear
does not tell me so. If it didor, rather, if it did not
tell me that I was not mad, I should have discretion
enough, I hope, to hold my tongue. There was one
man---a very respectable man too, who was once civil
enough to tell the publick, that something which I had
written was full of paltry egotism, and childish
vanity
.
That was very well. It was partly trueyou
know whom I meanI could have lacerated him for
it.
Mrs. Honeywell shook her headrather
emphatically
.
Yes, I
could!
said Hammond, in a voice, that
came from his heartand nothing saved him from it,
butmy respect for his daughter, and the interference
of Mr. Morton. You smile, madam. You wonder
more at my vanity
now
, than ever. By heaven! I could
have cut that man to the bones and marrow!
Her blue eyes were lighted up with fire---and her lips
trembled.
No---no!---you could not---he is too
great
a man.
A
great
man---
he
a great man!---O, no, he is an
honest, respectable, decent sort of a good man---but
far enough from being a
great
one.
No---no---not to the
marrow
---not to the
bone!
she repeated.
Aye---aye! reiterated Hammond, evidently, I
thought, to bring her to battle---aye---and I could
have shortened his life,
great
as he is---for ten
years---I know it---I feel it---he knows it.
You---
you!
---repeated Mrs. Honeywell---the blood
rushing over her forehead again---the veins all swelling;
and her agitated hands rattling upon the tabledo
you know who he is, and what?
Indeed I do not---who is he?
A persecuted, good, and great manI have seen.--
I know what you would say. I have heard of it
some plate that his townsmen gave him.
A man, continued Mrs. Honeywell, that has
educated
his daughterssolook at
them
---.
Yes, Madam
there
I agree with you. I respect
him for that---but he is not a
great
man---nevertheless;
and pray, now that we are upon the theme, how know
you, that he is so
good
a man?
I have known him for ten years.
Well, does that prove that he was good,
before
you
knew him?
No---but I have heard his history.
From whom?---from himself, I suppose---or from
his daughters?
No---from others.
Ah!---from others then, that---how know you, that
they
did not have it from him, or his daughters?
Pray tell me, plainlydo not let it disturb you
I do not mean to injure him.
Well!
Have you ever inquired of
strangers
about him?
his early life?---his character?---at home?
No---why should I inquire? I knew him---have
known him and his family, for ten years. No---I would
not listen to anything against him---I would not
believe
it---I
Is that prudent?is it wise?
I care not whether it be prudent or wise---I speak
from feeling. I will not hear him slandered.
But how can you love one, without knowing him
fully?---ten years, twenty years are not enough for this
---a man may be honest all his life---and a scoundrel
at the last hour. One fact will
prove
a man to be a
villain; thousands and thousands will not
prove
him to
be honest. How know you that he did not leave his
country---perhaps---for his country's good---suppose
that some one should come to you, and tell you that I see that you are excited---that he.
I will not hear you. No man shall speak
disrespectfully
of him, in my presence.
I like your spirit,your feelingyour generosity.
But is it
prudent?
Would
he
thank you for itwould
I?you have never inquired. Why?because you
were satisfied. But what right had you to be satisfied
when you had heard only one side?---You would not
listen to the other. Had your dearest friend come to
you, and said---that man is a scoundrel---I have heard
---that
Yes---yes, said Miss E, moving forward
eagerly---I have heard too---that is charming---is'nt
it Mrs. Monette?---what a treat it is!
No---said Hammond proudly---I know nothing
at all against the man. I spoke of him, accidentally,
merely because he had been severe upon me---not in
revenge
,
I am sure; for, had I been revengeful, there were
other ways to punish him. He was utterly in my
power
.
You smile, madam. Let me give you one instance,
among many. I had said that, we, in America, had no
names
except
Washington's
, worthy of poetry. He took
it up; and, with a great waste of fuel, began to ask,
what!---have we no Franklin's, no Jefferson's! No
Adam's, &c. Bless his heart!---I had been speaking
of
names
---and had even
italicised
the word, that I
might not be mistaken;
and all the fuss that he was
making---whizzing and whirring, like soap suds in a
gutter---was about
men
. That was one instance. I
could name others: but---I respect the man. He paid
me some compliments---but they did'nt go to the right
place---he did'nt feel, he could not feel what I had
written; and, therefore, his praise was worse than his
condemnation.
But Shakspeare! Shakspeare! said Miss E.
edging
in.
In one moment, said Mrs. Honeywell.
You have had a severe trial, said Hammond,
hobbling
out his chair, and offering her his ugly claw
a very severe one: but you ought to thank me for it--you
were never so eloquent; and, as I told youyour
unwillingness
to hear me open my lips against your friend,
looked suspicious. Had you been half so
sure
, as you
pretend to be, you would have dared me to tell, all that
I had known, or heard--instead of preventing me.
O no---of what use would it be: it would only make
me unhappy. There is evil enough about us. All the
world are too ready, now, to hearken to, and repeat it.
For that reason, I would have
my
friend listen to
it, were I in a like situation. It would enable her to
vindicate me, with knowledge, as well as zeal. The
innocent grow brighter in the very trial, and scrutiny,
that destroy guilt. I thank nobody for such
inprovident
confidence in
me
. If you have aught against
metell me of it; make me answer to it. What mean
your eyes. You
have
heard something against me.
Tell me, plainly, before all these people---tell me; or
you are not my friend.
Mrs. Honeywell smiled---a quick glance passed like
an electrick spark between her and one of the
ladies
.
I turned, and Hammond repeated the question.
Why---what is the meaning of this? said he, you
look distressed.
As he said this, his eye flashed upon the distant white
wall---when---Oh! it must have been terrible! he saw
what had caused their meriment and confusion.
They were looking at
his
shadow;---the unsightly
blackness was like a plastered devil, upon the white
wall opposite---and a large pointer, upon the rug, lay
eyeing it, with strong symptoms of terrour.
All eyes were turned toward it. And the room was
silent as death.
Hammond set his teeth---his eyes dilated---his lips
writhed---he put his locked hands to his forehead, for a
moment---a mortal paleness followed---the disorder of
his heart was soon gone---his lips parted, and
quivered---and
,
when he took down his hands, there was a
melancholy lustre, as of a noble nature, outraged to
tears, under the lashes.
VOL. II. G
Elizabeth, I perceived, had retired behind her
beautiful
neighbour, and I could not well see her face; but, I
observed that her hands, which I
could
see, were
agitated
,
in her lap.
You had been
kinder
, Madam, said he, in a lower
tone, and with an altered front---all its lordliness had
gone---he stood, like a broken hearted man---had you
been more
sincere
. I forget myself. I do not blame
you for laughing at, or quaking before the horrible
shadow. If it were the shadow of anything that God
had not made---and breathed his divinity into, I should
laugh, too. But, I cannot mock at his doing---and I
will not weep, while I, alone, am the sufferer. You had
done better; it would have been worthier of your
gentleness
and humanity, at first, to tell the truth---the shock
would have been less humiliating and sudden.
There was a pause; and not a breath could be heard;
yet I thought that there was the soundvery faintly
of some one, sobbingI dared not moveI dared not
inquire who it wasbut I had my suspicionand I
grew faint with it.
Yet, this is not the first timeno, not the
first
,
that the distorted shadow of one, made, it hath been
bitterly
said of me, in the image of God Almightyhath
been the cause of distress, or merriment, among brave
hearts; and once, it left me bloodybloody! I have
not yet atoned for itII am naturally kind of heart
but, there was a child too; a lovely child, that I so
frighted once, as to make its mother hate me. She was
like
that
oneI strove hard against my nature, and
with the devil
here
, not to strangle them both, for it.
Another pauseit was yet more terrible. The room
was getting darkthe lamp wanedand there was
nobody to remember
why
. All looked, as if they thought
it preternatural.
I do not wonder, continued Hammond, with a
voice, like one parleying with a spirit, at his very
elbow
.
I do not wonder, that Richard was a devil
that Lord Byron is a devilbut O, (clasping his hands,
together; and wringing them, till the joints cracked)
Merciful Father!let me not live to be a thirdlet me
live to overcome the demon!to digest the bitterness of
my own heartto forget this inward scalding.
He then went to Mrs. Honeywell, whose face was
buried in her hands. Come, Madam, comeit is all
over now. The cut went to my heartbut, it was the
cut of a sharp kniferather deep, than painful; one
word more, however. You are wrong, not to listen to
both sides, where a friend is concerned. Tell me, will
youwhat it is that you have heard of
me?
Do you insist upon it?
here?
said Mrs.
Honeywell
.
Yes, Madam. Really, it is a poor compliment
this hesitation. It shows that you have some
doubt
.
Oh, nonot at all.
I beg your pardon. If you had
no doubt
of my
innocence
,
you would mention the report, fearlessly;
whatever it were.
Were you ever acquainted with a Captain Seyton?
Hammond startedwas silent for a moment, as if
struck with a sudden painand then answered.
Yes.I shot him
.
In a duel?
Yes.
Not in a duel!---HammondMr. Hammond! I would
say; said Elizabeth, with a faint cry.
Yesin a duel. Hereafter, I will tell you how it
happened, that I was so wicked, and foolish.
Well, wellnever mind the duellet us hear the
argument finishedsaid Mrs. E. It is the greatest
treat in the world, to me, to hear you and Mrs.
Honeywell
converse. Let it be
finished
.
Yesso I saylet it be
finished
said Mrs.
Honeywell
,
laughing.
Renewed;
you mean, Miss E. said the younger
daughter; arguments are never
finished
.
The oldest daughter here rubbed her eyesand one
of the lawyers left the room.
YesI am willing to
finish
it, I assure you; for, I
am anxious to convince youand I am
sure
that I
could, said Hammond, to Mrs. Honeywell.
Convince me! of what? that I ought to hear my
friend slandered? Nonevernever!
MadamI do assure you, that I couldnayI
will
if you will listen to me, for five minutes.
What! if I were a wife, I suppose that you would
come to me, and tell me all that my husband had ever
doneand break my heartand.
Yes!Yes!
Yes!
If you were my sisterand
he
had been scoundrel enough
not
to tell you! Yes!
Yes!
if I heard a slander, that I
knew to be false
, I would
tell you of itthat you might not hear it from another;
if true, that you might profit by it.
Yesand destroy my confidence in my husband
set me, as a spy upon his action; fill my heart, with
distrust and apprehension! O, these are the people,
that drug the cup of heaven, with death!
Beautifully said, Madam; but, hear me, for one
moment
.
Our attachments, to be valuable, must be the
growth of knowledge. Is it not so?
How?
I mean, that they should be founded upon
examination
,
study and enquiry. It is our duty to know our
whole nature, if we can, before we are intimate, in any
degree. But your doctrine would lead you to shut
your eyes against the dearest friend on earth, though
he should come to you, and say. You are intimate
with Mr. A. or Mr. B. You believe him to be a good
man. You are deceived.
I would not listen to him.
I
would
, upon my honour---very patiently---though
it were uttered against the dearest friend that I have,
on this earth.
You would! said Miss E.
Yes---and I would then go to my friend, and tell
him what I had heard---show my confidence in him, by
giving him an opportunity to vindicate himself; search
into the truth of the whole matter; never rest, till I
came to the bottom of it; that done, if I found it
true
,
though it cost me my own life, I would go and thank
the man; nay, if it were
false
, and he, who had set me
upon the track, had acted with a manly, or innocent
feeling, I would still thank him; and put it into his
power to contradict it; but, if it were coinage of his
own; malicious or vindictive---wo to him---
wo
to him,
though he were my own brother. But you, Madam,
you
would not listen to him.
You
, yourself would not. I am sure of it.
Noyou would not, perhaps, if the person were
addressing your daughter.
O, that would be a different affair.
Or yourself!
Why, in such matters
they
are extreme cases! I
might be willing to listen.
You ought to be, in all cases. Who knows what
would become of us, if we followed your doctrine, even
in the common intercourse of life? What would
console
you, if, after you had refused to listen to a friend,
you should find that some villain had been, for years,
the companion of yourself and children? No
do
your
dutybe cautious, circumspect, and distrustful; if you
would make your good opinion valuable. Do your
duty; and, whatever happen, you will be happy. I say
to you, as I did to Mr. Hullwhen he came to employ
me, in behalf of his son, who was afterwards hanged.
You cannot save him, said I. You must not expect it.
But, do your duty; leave no stone unturned. You will
be happier then, though he be
hanged
, than you would
be, if he were pardoned; and you had neglected
anything
,
to procure his pardon. In the first place, a
consciousness
of having done your utmost, would sustain
you; in the latter, your heart would reproach you, for
ever, with having hazarded your child's life, by your
omission.
But, let us examine the business, fairly. If you
were married, would you, or would you not listen?
O, then, said she, tenderly, passionately, like one
that
had
suffered; I would be ignorant. Where
ignorance
is
bliss
, 'twere folly to be
wise
; you know.
I commend your recollection, my dear Madam; but
ignorance never
is
bliss. And why might not one tell
you of any hidden evil, in your husband's nature
any.
VOL. II. G 2
What good could it do?
Much
I can imagine many cases.
No, no! It is impossible. You never shall
convince
me.
Madam; said Hammond, leaning toward her, his
large, black, glittering eyes rivetted upon her; and his
hand thrust into his bosom, up to the elbow, as into hot
embers, in search of his own heart. Madam!---I
can
convince you. I
will!
Suppose that your husband had been intemperate, in
his youth---a madman; and that a glass of wine would
drive him again. to fury; suppose that you knew it not;
that he had kept the secret; and that you had wondered,
for many years, at his abstinence, but never knew the
cause; that you had, for it might well be, in the
festivity
of your heart, determined to make him overcome his
dislike to it, though you were obliged to mingle the
wine with his food. Suppose then---
then!
Madam, that
some friend, who knew your husband's infirmity--knew
that it was a secret, to all the world, but the sufferer
and himself, should come to you; and lay his hand upon
yours, and cry out
beware!
would you put poison into
his cup? How would you bless him! It might save
you, and your little ones.
Yes!---and make me die, ten thousand deaths, by
apprehensionset me to watching every movement of
his countenanceevery tone of his voicein the
horrible
thought of madness.
Nay; but it would enable you to aid
him
, in his
self-denial
:
to spare him the agony of explanationto
sustain
him, under temptation, and trialand to prevent
others from playing, as you were about to play with
his life---and
soul!
Yes---but it would kill
me:
---it might prolong
his
life---but I should die of a broken heart, frighted away
from him.
And what death would be so welcome to an
affectionate
and devoted wife?---to
die
in preserving
his
life
---to
She was silent---and her deep eyes were clouded
with passionate emotion:---and Hammond continued,
in a voice of such unutterable pathos, depth and
mournfulnesss
,
that, when he had done---we all drew one long
breath together---and were silent for many minutes.
Suppose another case---said he. You are
married
,
and happy, beyond the lot of women. Yet---and
you know it---there is a terrible, untold calamity, in
the life of your husband, upon which it is not lawful to
speak. No matter how you have come to suspect this.
You know not what it is---but---when the sea roars---
and the wind blows---and the rain beats---or the noise
of shipwreck---and the cry of drowning people are told of
---you see his forehead work---and the sweat coming
out of it. Would you not bless the man---kneel down,
and bless him---who would come to you, and say
Lady---beware how you talk of sudden death---or of
drifting bodies--or of the wild sea breaking, in wrath,
upon the wind,---for your husband once lost the dearest
things on earth to him---a wife and child!--by shipwreck
---and went mad upon the spot. He loves you---hath
always loved you, to distraction---but he dared not tell
you this, lest it should drive
you
mad. Would you not
bless him! You yield. I knew that you would. You are
always right, when you permit yourself to think. I
would risk my right hand, that I can bring you to agree
with me, wherebless my soul!I had no idea
that it was so late.
Yessaid Mrs. Honeywellbutyou will give
up, about Shakspeare?
Whatabout that nonsense which you quoted.
What was it?repeat it, will you?
I forget how he brings it inbut the thought
is
beautifulhe speaks of knitting up the ravelled sleeve
of care.
And what idea have you of it?said Hammond. She began to explain, but he interrupted her. NoI
never saw it beforeand if you did not assure me, that
it was in Shakspeare, I would deny itI would swear
that such intolerable trash could not be his. I wonder
at you. It is a confused, ill-managed, laboured
conceit
.
Why not say, sew up the scarlet elbow of care
or new cover the buttonsor try-out the cuff. There
is no fitness in the thought. You laugh. But, upon
my honour, I can see no difference between themit is
theI beg your pardonbut no other word will
express
itit is about the damnedest nonsense in the
world.
There was a general shockas if a thunderbolt had
exploded in the ceilingand his voice were a trumpet
call.
But it is Shakspeare; and that is enough. I
remember
once travelling through Boston, and meeting
with a paper, called the
Centinel
, in which some fool or
otherI don't mean the
Editor
had hit upon a new
reading in Shakspeare. You remember where Hamlet
meets his mother, and compares the pictures. Hamlet
is speaking of the usurper, who, like a thief, the
precious
diadem stoleand
put it in his pocket
. Now,
said the critick, the words in italick are only a
stage
direction
which, in transcribing, came to be
incorporated
with the textand mean that Hamlet puts the
picture
into his pocket! What! he criesa diadem to be
put in a king's pocketWhat a pocket his majesty must
have! It was in a friend's counting room, that I saw
it;and, so indignant was I, that it was for some
minutes
a question with me, whether I should break into
the Editor's house, and curse
him
for his stupidity, in
admitting such a criticism, or reply to it. But I
resolved
on the latterand there, as I stood, scribbled a
few lines, on two or three scraps of execrable paper: and put them, with my own hands, into the box, as I went
by. They were published. The blockheads!They
knew not, what they ought to have known---before
they presumed to approach Shakspeare, except, upon
their naked hands and feetthat till John Kemble's
time,
that
part was always played with two portraits,
hanging side by sideof the two kings;as if the
murderer
could abide the painted spectre of the dead
monarch
or
his incestuous queen, the awful reproach of
his lifeless shadowperpetually smiling upon her, it
may be, even while she was in the arms of his
murderer
.
It would have been, to the full, as easy, one would
think, to put the diadem in a pocket, as one of the
portraitsand quite as natural.
But againthe ghost appears---and then, if the
critick be right, Hamlet is directed to
put the picture
into
his pocket
, before he takes his positionhis attitude
of horrour. By heaven! it were about as rational to
give a stage direction to Hamlet thus
Hamthe precious diadem
stole
.
And
(Ghost enters---Hamlet blows his nose)
as to give it in the manner that the critick requires which is this---
Ham the precious diadem
stole
,
And
(Ghost enters---Hamlet puts the picture in his pocket.)
But what meant ShakspeareShakspeare! the
anointed
one! He meant this---and none but a commentator,
a critick; or an Editor---
could
have misunderstood it.
He meant that the scoundrel king
stole
the crown, like
a shop-lifter, from the majesty of buried Denmark that he did not
conquer
it!--in harness and steel--blood and
dust. But---heaven forgive me!---he added, halting
toward the French lady---who sat mute with
astonishment
;---for
he had not permitted a living creature to
open his lips, that evening.
Ah madame, Je vous demande pardon
, said he----
Pardon!---pourquoi
?---she replied.
He touched his lips---and she understood him---for
she smiled, wickedly, and added---now! I vill-zay
to
you, Mr. Hammon, vat-zat zee queen say---zee queen
Elizabess---she-zay to zee ladee zat haf not gif, to er

O, the
ring
, said Hammond, bowing---I wait
the report---this battle of the eyes over; it is a part of
your
duty to give in the killed and wounded---but what
said Elizabeth?
O,----zee ladee haf-keep zee jewail----Monsieur
Hammon---cst egal; vous avez fait la mme chose you haf keep ze

.
O, ho!---said Mrs. Honeywell, tapping Hammond
on the arm,---I understand the drift---you have given
us
words
, and kept the
jewelry
to yourself.
Throwing pearls beforeahem said her
younger daughter---colouring at the sound of her own
voice.
Hush---hush!---answered the mother---well what
did the queen say---madame?
O, she-say----Dieu peut vous pardonner----mais,
moi!---Je ne vous pardonnerai jamais!
Bravo! cried the elder daughter, laughing
outright
,
till her large blue eyes ran over, bravo! Mr.
Hammond, I think you
have
got the
bague
now.

. There can be no doubt, I think, that the author
has introduced this page, for no purpose in the world, but, as an
excuse
for repeating a few words of French, which, it is highly
probable
,
that he does not understand. I have met with such things before.
There is a Spanish phrase in

which is the motto of the first chapter. Shame on such childish

Pray
, said I, as soon as we were sufficiently
alone togetherit was a week after this conversation,
that is related in the preceding chapterPray
Hammond
,
tell me about the duel.
Which one?
Which one! were there more than one?
YesI have been well nigh. engaged in four or five;
but never actually in the field, but oncefor which, I
pray God, to forgive me.
What! that you have never been in the field but
once?
Nothat I have ever been out, at all.
Did you kill your man?
Yes.
On the spot?
Nohe lived three years afterwardswent to sea
for his health, and died.
And how do you feel about it?
Feel!
so help me God! that it had been better for
me
, had I been killed upon the spot.
As he said this, he thrust out his long arms, at their
full length before him; and shut his eyes, with such a
look of unutterable desolation, that I felt my blood run
cold. Surely, thought I, the dead body must have
passed at that moment; and he must have felt it.
There was a silence of some minutes, that I was
truly
afraid
to interrupt. But it grew insupportable, at
at last; and I made some noise with my feet. He
heeded it notstirred notbut his shut eyes were
quivering
in the socketsthe water oozing and trickling,
drop by drop, from under the heavy lids, down to his
mouth, while all the rest of his face was immoveable,
and pale as marble. It was terrifick.
Hammond! I cried, in unaffected alarm.
Fire! he answered, instantlyuncovering his
breast, as if to receive a shot.
Hammond! Hammond! I cried, again.
He opened his eyesthey were blood shotsaw
mestarted upand instantly recollected himself.
Tell me how it happened; said I.
Be patient, he replied. Bear with me. Let me
walk a few minutes. I have much to tell. It is not
a proper time. I would have you know all about me;
and tomorrow nightif you are better not employed,
I.
Tomorrow night, be it, then, said I.
After that, he sat down again; and we chattered
away the best part of the evening together; and a part
of the next day, in a most pleasant and sociable
manner
.
But, on the night, agreed upon, when I entered
the room, I saw that he had been writinghis features
were pale and stiff. You should know all, that you may
be prepared for whatever may happen. But I shall
expect
the same confidence from you.
You will be disappointed, said I. No human
being
shall ever know
how
I have passed nearly one year
of my life; or where. I have no disposition to conceal
the fact that, there is blood upon
my
hands too:blood,
less innocently shed than yoursbut where---and when,
and why shed, I cannot tell. Three years of my life, are
dark to me; so dark, that I dare not approach them
in thought. There was a black ocean about me, then
---another being and I, passed each other; like two
privateers---at
night---in a gale of wind. There were
shrieks---and fire---and smoke---and a cannonading,
or something like it---it might have been thunder.---
And, when I was fully myself again, there was the smell
of blood, fresh blood about me; on my hair; upon my
clothes; upon my hands! O Christ! I cannot, cannot
go on. That is all that you will ever know. It is
nearly all that I, myself know. Are you satisfied with
it?
No.
It was revenge, perhaps?
No matter.
Jealousy?
Aye---jealousy, perhaps.
Was it the blood of innocence?
No matter. It shall not be told. I know not.
He shook my hands, and turned away his face.
I know not, said he, why I have undertaken to
judge you. There is One, that hath authority. We
have both sinned; I, probably, with the least excuse,
for jealousy never shook my heart---never will.---Of
whom, can such a creature as I, be jealous? Three
years!
you say---that cannot be---there is not more
than
one
year in all, in which I have lost sight of you; and
the longest period, where there are no
certain
traces of
you, is about only eight or ten weeks. But no matter.
Both of us are red transgressors.---Let us repent.
Let us be compassionate to each other; and, now that
the world are willing to let us alone, guilty that we
are, let us be wary, for the future; and repent
betimes
.
In one word---Let us be
good
. What say you.
We embraced; and I wept upon his bosom---What
was there, in his strange voice, that so mastered me? I
could not resist it. It was like the wizard summoning
of one, that looks into a cavern, haunted with unclean
spirits, and brave princely creatures, and bids them
separate and come forth. Mine obeyed him; and my
hear tfelt warmer, cleare, once rid of the pestilent
warring
tenantry.
Are you ready for the tale?
All ready, said I, throwing myself back into the
most comfortable chair, that I ever sat inflinging
one leg over a pile of books, at my right hand; and
resting the other upon a high fender---willing to make
myself at
home
.
Well---you know something of the difficulty, that I
had to encounter in my boy-hood; and enough of what
passed, till you disappeared. Soon after that, I began
to hear you spoken of, sometimes with affection; often,
as one capable of great things: and I began to learn
that, if one would know his own strength, he must go
abroad. We cannot learn to swim upon a table. We
must go among the breakers. A man may stand
forever
vol. ii. H
upon a precipice, if he trust to nothing but his own
limbs. But, if he rely upon a cobweb, in any degree;
and it should snap,---he is gone!
I determined to go abroad; to seek you, if I could,
my friend. Elizab---your
sister
had taught me the value
of my faculties. I began to study her character, before
I did yours;---for I considered you as a petulant idiot,
particularly after you half strangled your uncle, and
blew up his boys with gunpowder. But your sister, I
could study for everand she taught me to know you
better. As we grew older, my respect for her became
awful---it was religious---the duel was on her account.
She does not know it---and I would not have her know
it. It is a secret to all but you. Let it remain so. You
know that she is resolved never to marry. I am sorry
for itfor she cannot live so long as Iand I should love
to toil for her children, when she is in her grave. Such
a woman---that will not marry---from loftiness of heart,
delicacy of sentiment, and genuine independence, ought
to be set up for men to wonder at.
I have always loved to hear the name of Elizabeth
spoken reverently; and, particularly, when it was by
them that had power and beauty of mind enough, to
understand
her; enough of that strange affinity, which
nature
has established, between creatures of the same rank;
yet here was a man that could understand hera man
of exceeding potency, and very honest, speaking of her,
in the language that I most loved to hear; yetyet
I cannot deny it; the swell of my heart was unlike any
that I had ever felt before, when Elizabeth was
praised
;
it was bitter, painful, and sorrowfulalarming:
I would have asked him to tell me why; but I dared
not; and I know not whether he observed any alteration
in my countenance or not, for he continued, much in the
same tone, to relate to me. the following particulars of
his life. I was amazed at the resemblance in a part of
our history, and disposition. Yet, his had been the
less calamitous, and the less varied life; and
his
, the
nobler, and more patient temper. I felt it; and what
I feel, I am always ready to acknowledge. His
rebuking
went home to my heart; and, when he had done, I
do confess to you, that I felt ashamed of many things, in
my life, upon which, till then, I had been accustomed
to look only with a feeling of complacency; and,
sometimes
,
of exultation. But nohe dashed them to the
earthlaughed at mequelled me, and taught me, ere
he had well done, that to be, in any degree
great
, is to
be
good
. He did not teachwhat is not truethat
there is any irretrievable or unpardonable sin, either
before God and his angels, or before men;but he did
teach, what
is
true, that blackness and death are, for
ever, upon that part of the soul, where transgression
hath but once, and for a single moment, laid her
burning
hand; that Repentance, and Contrition, and
Sorrow
,
may pour their oil and wine into the bruised heart,
or the broken foreheadbut that, for ever and ever,
the scar will remain, and the agony of remembrance.
He did not teach, for he was wise and honest, that one
may
not be the mightier in his uprising, who hath
suffered
longest under the accumulation of evil: nor
that one, who stumbles, and yet touches not the earth,
or touches it, if he touch it, like Antus, for renovation
and invulnerability, may not, thereby, exhibit to the
world, powers that, if he had
not
stumbled; or had gone
steadily along the precipices of life, had never been
developed
or suspectedno!but he taught that, to
stumble at allupon any precipice, is putting your
immortal
soul, unpreparedly, at hazard.
You know, said he, that I went behind a
counter
,
just about the same time that you did; but, it was
never after my taste. It appeared to me
dishonourable
,
for men to take upon themselves a business, so
entirely
fitted, as retailing, for the support of helpless
women
,
widows, and orphans; and so much easier, more
profitable, and more respectable for them, than the
occupations
,
to which they are generally driven, by the men
that have monopolized
their
trade. Commonly, when
a woman is left destitute upon the world, she is obliged
to keep a school, or to take boarders
[4]
[4]

.
neither of which
will leave her a provision for her old age, or permit to
her the commonest enjoyment of life. I soon became
weary of the business; and thought of some profession.
I looked about me; but I was friendless and destitute.
The church had its temptation; but how was I to
disinthral
myself from the world?how, to become initiated.
I was neither abject, dastardly, nor willing to go
apprentice
to any man's religious opinion, as to a
trade
,
I say
apprenticeship
, because, it
is
one. How happens
it, that the pupils preach the same doctrine, when they
set up for themselves, that their masters taught? Can
it be
conviction?
Is it likely to be?No! When a
father wishes to make a minister of his boy, he always
put him to learn the trade of some person, who thinks
as
he
does; or whose mode of thinking is fashionable
and profitable. What is he then, but an
apprentice?
Where, then, was I to find a man, who would educate
me; converse with me; reason with me; and when he had
done, leave me utterly to God, and to my own
understanding
,
for my choice of religion? Or where was I
to find a theological seminary, where I could be
educated
,
in
any way
,even by sweeping the rooms, and
waiting upon the table, of my fellow studentsrunning
their errands, and abiding their jeers and taunting,
meeklyfrom which, or from the creed of which, when
I was ready to go out into the world, if I ventured to
dissentwhere was there one that would
license
me?
one that would not brand me as an apostate? Ah, my
friend, (let me begin to call you so) I had such dreams!
Could I have but set my foot within the church
though there were no college of Jesus; no Jesuits about
meno bishops, nor archbishops; cardinals, nor popes,
within the reach and scope of my ambition, I do feel
assured
assured
William Adams, that the Dwarf
would have wrought powerfully among the nations;
and left a name behind him, that would not readily
have been forgotten
But no. This career was not for me. The church
was walled round with triple brass to me. I had no
rich friends; was no fawning beggar; could neither
sell myself to this congregation, nor to that; nor to
any missionary society; and so---I was fain to abandon
that hope. In time, there were people, who affected to
understand my heart; but they deceived themselves.
They granted that my doctrines were those of
morality
;
but,---and
I never pretended that they
were
;
that they were
not
those of
religion
. No sect claimed
me---there was no communion for
me
---, no creed.
Why? Let me lay bare the secret. That
only
, was
religion
, to every man, you know, which every man
followed as
his
. The rest was
heresy
. Of course, as I
followed the religion of no one---blessing my God,
that he had given me some understanding, and
some
wisdom; and praying for more---to
all
, I was a
heretick
.
Successively, I traversed in thought, most of the
trades and professions of men; and, at last, weary of the
search, yet heaving, continually, after dominion, I sat
myself down, patiently, unweariedly, to what I
regarded
as my duty; and, as I saw no prospect of being either
a lawyer, soldier, actor, physician or divine, I
determined
to be, though it should take me half a century, a
great merchant. I knew that the name was honourable;
the power great; and, that he, who was only a
great
merchant
, was on a level with kingsnay, with
statesmen
.
But how was this to be achieved; I was pennyless;
and my spirit had been hampered, and subdued from
its capacity and elevation, by the mercentary, paltry
trifling, of a retail shop. Yet---it is my nature, never
to despairnay, never to despond. I knew that the
greatest men have arisen from the smallest
beginning
;---that
the largest fortunes are but a combination
of cents---the ocean, of drops.
And, while these thoughts were working within me,
I met a young man, unlike me in every respect; but
well enough for my purpose---(I only wanted him for a
stepping stone)---who pretended that he had money and
friends. These, I knew, were the true mechanical
powers of life. With them, you may heave a world,
without troubling yourself for a place to establish your
machinery upon. My first movement, was to
buy out
,
as it is called,
the stock
of an experienced shopkeeper;
in other words, to purchase at
any
price, the
accumulated
vol. ii. H 2
refuse and rubbish of a whole generation, merely
to get what was called a
good stand
, in a country town.
My proposals were very distinct: the terms were
acceded
to; but the stock, which, we had been told, would
amount to only three or four thousand dollars, we
found fast approximating to ten or twelve. This was
not to be born---I had no idea of selling myself, wrist
and ancle, for life, to vend old goods---; and, as the best
way of backing out of the agreement,---I electioneered
so, as to make the owner
insist
for his
ultimatum
, upon
a security, that we could not possibly give! This
concluded the negotiation; and the store, owner and
goods got the benefit of a dusting, and re-arrangement,
which all wanted;---and I, lighter of heart by a whole
world, leaped about, for a month, like a galley slave
set unexpectedly at liberty, by a thunder clap; or some
miraculous melting, or sundering of his chains.
After this, I continued my way, lumbering along
the great turnpike of life, until I found myself doing
business a while, on a very respectable scale, in New
York; and soon after, in a more diminutive, but very
productive one, in Boston; and then, in a city of the
south.
It would be idle to dwell upon any of these
intermediate
stages of my life; and, therefore, I will take you,
at once, into the hurry, and bustle, and distraction, of
that, which shipwrecked me. It was in a southern,
city
.
I need not tell you where; but, with one clerk, I
will venture to say that I made more
money
, honestly,
in a few months, than was made by any three
warehouses
in the city, during the same time; though some
of them had an army of clerks and household troops.
But then, there were vicissitudes. I had become
associated
with two other menmen, to whom, I am
willing
to confess, that I owe everything that is dear to
me---
in business
. One was an adventurous fellow,
understanding
better the
ways
and
means
of financiering,
than any human creature, I believe, except Law, the
projector
of the Mississippi scheme; yet credulous, beyond
belief; a being, who never gave himself any other
trouble
in life, than to sell as many goods as he could, at as
large a profit as he couldfor anybody's note; it
mattered
not much, whose; the other, a high minded man; and
I then thought, of more inflexible integrity, strength of
character, genuine, unadulterated feeling---than any
other, that I have ever known. Not two men could have
been worse fashioned for sober merchandising. The
one was literally a commercial gambler; the other,
ignorant
,
beyond belief, of all the paltry tricking and
detail
of trade; who had been educated to another
profession
;
in which, one day, he would have stood, almost
alone; but God had laid his visiting hand upon him,
and broke him down, utterly, in all, but the integrity
of his heart. He had his share of business, in his own
profession; but, when he got hold upon it, sickness came
upon him; and he was put back, a whole season; for a
time too, that, in the outset of our career, is
irretrievable
.
But he renewed the trial; and persisted, till his
little property was dissipated---and clouds were about
him---and his great heart was heavy---nay, till there
were bidders for him, and his conscience---till men
thought to buy, even his political integrity.
The man who became his partner and mine,
afterward
,
saw the struggle, and dealt plainly with him.
Come to me; said he; enter into partnership, with me.
I do not ask you to meddle with the business. You can
keep the books; and sign checks and notes; and play
the gentleman, when necessary; and write letters for
the house; eat dinners; and that will be all that I shall
ask.
It was a struggle of life and death to him---it was
selling his birthright---his title to immortality, for so
much
trash
as may be grasped thus; but the bread
the
bread
, that his wife and babe were to feed upon
could be bought, only with that
trash
; and that could
he had, only by subjection to men that would just feed
him for his musick; or, by accepting this proposal. He
accepted of the latter; and, it was soon after the union
of these two men, that I met with them; and was, in one
way and another, put
into business
[5]
[5]
Yes, faithso it appearsand a pretty business it was too, that

by them. I was
sent to the south, as I have told you, with letters; among
which, was one, to a scurvy old gentleman, of whom I
shall have occasion, soon, to speak, more particularly,
as the most unrelenting, pitiless, iron-handed man,
that ever wrung the blood out of a human heart.
My business was exceedingly prosperous; and I soon
persuaded my partners to join me, where I was
established
.
But, here began our reverses. We were
three; and, when a question was to be decided, between
me and the financier, it was sure to be decided by our
partner,
against
me. The consequence was, that we
speculated too largelyour goods were detained at
sea, an unprecedented timethe season for business
passed awayand we were left, to pay for our
purchases
,
out of the reluctant proceeds of a tremendous
stock, rapidly declining. Our exertions were
desperate
.
We had two large, wholesale stores, open; and
we immediately established two others, for retailing;
careful, at the same time, like all persons in similar
circumstances, to crowd off all that we could, of our
stock, upon every tolerable pretence of security;
selling
to such as were
recommended
to us, by our
neighbours
;
forgetful that such a recommendation ought
always
to startle us; if the person recommended be a
debtor
of the one that recommends.
We had to renew our notes---as we could---giving
such security
as
we could; and lugging in, as men
always
do, when they are drowning, all those who are
foolish enough in their friendship, to venture within
their reach. It is true, that we believed our concern
solvent to a large amount, notwithstanding all our
losses;---but, we did not
know
it; and were, therefore,
guilty of embarrassing our best friends.
At last, the spring opened; and we strained, like
men heaving for their lives, to throw off the burden
that was leaning upon us; and the better to assist us, in
disposing of an old stock, we sent to Philadelphia for
a small quantity of fresh goods. The scheme was
well; and a partner (the adventurer) carried it into
effect. But while he was gone, I had rather an ugly
process of examination gone through with; and the re
sult was, that I found we were ruined;---and, as
honest
men, could not go on, any longer. He returned;
and, that night, we never shut our eyes. He was
thunderstruck
,
at what I told him.
What would be said of us? said he---These late
purchases of ours will look villainously black. All
our desperate exertions will be regarded as deliberate
villany, to get what we could, into our hands, before
we failed.
We must submit to the imputation, for awhile,
said I. But our duty is plain. The goods must all
be sent back.
But a part are already sold.
Then let us send back what are not sold---and
permit
the creditor to choose from our stock, for the
deficiency
.
That was agreed to:---yet---it is a pity that such
things should not be known!---there was a man, in
Philadelphia, of whom we had purchased largely; and
to whose agent, we had returned the goods, in this
way; yet he has persecuted us, ever since, with a more
deadly and unsparing malignity, for the amount of a
few dollars, that had been taken out and sold, before
I had come to a determination to return them, than
any other human being.
[6]
[6]
I am requested to addthat the Philadelphian was named
Richard
Milre
a man that has the reputation of never having
forgotten
,
or forgiven
any
debtof
any
kind. There was a house too,
in New-York
Bulkley
and
Butler
of the same amiable, humane
temperwith fine prospects before themin this world and the next:
and one, in Baltimore, namedbut no matter for the namea
misfortune has fallen upon them all, and the persecutor is forgiven,
for the sake of his children, cruel and bitter as was the persecution.
We had a hundred other trials to endure. Like
other men, full of blood and confidence, from whose
hands the cup is not entirely wrenched, we were
willing
to make some terms, before we capitulated. We
talked with our friends;---and, particularly, with a
testy
old gentleman, named Galligan, who complained
a good deal afterward, about my
ingratitude
, of which
I shall soon give you a notion;---and the result was,
that he advised me to pay such of our creditors, as
were
frightened
, in goods; with a wink o' the eye, that said
plainer than words could have said it---frighten 'em
first;
and then nab 'em.
This old man was the
first
to give me this advice---
Pay 'em, said he, if they're frightened,
pay
'em!---
You know, my boy, you know---tell 'em you're the boy
what buys goods o' me---make 'em
pay
. At the same
time, he took
notes
, as security for
his
debt, knowing
that, if they were to be sold at auction,
they
would
bring much more, than the same amount of goods,
unseasonable
and tremendously charged as ours were. I
mention these things, dear Adams, because I would
have you understand something, of what you may
expect
,
if you should ever be shipwrecked, or burnt out:
and, briefly, that I may come the sooner to a more
interesting
part of my life.
I beg you to keep him---(the old man) in your mind
awhile. He afterward complained of my
ingratitude
.
The ground of which complaint, I
know
to be this.
My partner, the letter writer, furnished me with a civil
introduction to this old gentleman, in which, adroitly
enough, he alluded to something in
his
early history,
which tickled him. I presented the letter; and was
asked---I believe---but I am not sure---how the writer
was. That was the extent of his civility. Not
another
word passed, having any relation to him, or to me;
and I went away, with a feeling of strong and heated
indignation against myself, for having born the letter;
and against the writer, for having subjected me to such
a mortification; and against old Mr. Galligan, for his
ill manners; nor did I ever go to see him again. But
one day, some months afterward, somebody, whom I
took to be a mendicant; or, at least, some small dealer;
for I had forgotten his face, came into my store; and,
after sitting there awhile, urged me to come up, and
see him. It was Mr. Galligan himself. I smiled at
his civility; for my store was then loaded with goods;
and I was full of business. Ought I not to be
grateful
,
very
grateful
, to one that was willing to sell me a
bale or two of coarse woollens, under such
circumstances
?
Ought I not, when, at twenty-four hours notice,
I could have purchased five times the amount of his
whole stock, in the publick market---
gratitude!
Yes! I am full of
gratitude!
---and here is a proof of it.
Yet, of this, he complained afterward---when we
had paid, or secured our borrowed money, and
endorsements
,
as an ill requited act of
friendship
Alas!---
the impudence of some men!
Well-- as our difficulties thickened upon us, we
began
to follow his advice; and pay off, such of our
creditors---as
were foolish enough to take them, in goods;
but, unfortunately---they would not hold out. And we
were obliged then, to propose an accommodation. We
corresponded with our creditors. All had the
highest
,
best opinion in the world, of our honesty and
excellence
,
and all that---were excessively sorry,
but, really, times were so hard, that they---could
not afford---to say---yes or no, to any of our
propositions
.
At last, however, they promised to accede, one
by one, to an assignment of our property; and discharge
us.
It was drawn up. Months were consumed in the
negotiation; and, when nearly all had signed, the
remainder
held out, the scoundrels! in the hope of
obtaining
better terms for themselves.
There was now, no other way open to us, but to
petition, for a discharge under the insolvent law.
This we had been most reluctant to do---, but, at last,
did
it; and then came the rub. In a short time, we
were so utterly reduced; beggared, that, from having
had the command of almost unlimited sums---we were
scarcely able, at times, except by borrowing, to take
a letter out of the post office. My elder partner, the
married one, fell sick;---and I stood by him, and saw
friend after friend pass away from him---the whole
world go by him---for he had fallen among thieves;
and none stopped, to pour tears, or wine, or oil into his
wounds---Yea!---I saw his family go from him, one by
one; his children; his wife; and himself, left alone,
utterly alone, in the maturity of his years; like a
shipwrecked man---famished and bruised, clinging to
his only rock---a compassionate God; while an ocean
of darkness roared under his feet; and the tide was
rising. Yet, how did he bear it. As one that
knoweth
the Scripture; and believeth, that whom the Lord
loveth, he chasteneth. Yet, there were doubt and
harrowing; and who would not have had them,
situated
as he was---his towering faculties darkened; his
wife and children passing, like pale apparitions, before
him; the noblest sympathies of nature blasted, all at
once; outraged in their luxuriance, as by the ashes and
lava of some inward eruption of the heart! By him,
have I set, when the last spoon of his wife had just been
sold, to pay the rent of his room; and he seemed
deserted
of all
but
God;when his dark, luminous eyes;
and heavy, black brows were like statuary; motionless
and marble like. And there were times too, in the
deep solitude of midnight, when his Bible lay open
before him; and he, it might be, was the only mortal
awake, in a populous city, except the prowling
murderer
;
the roused watchman; or the dying; or the broken
hearted,---when, had he not been a good, as well as a
great man, he would have lain down upon his bed, and
never risen again, but to face his creditors before the
bar of the Everlasting God---red with his own blood.
But enough. I cannot talk of this---it is too
serious
for me. It shakes me too like the passion of a
wild beast. But the trial had its issue; and the sun
broke out upon him; and from the east, there came out
a great multitude to meet him. He is now happy---
God be thanked!---happy, as a mere mortal may be,
among them that love him, and reverence him; and
them, that he has wedded himself, and his
immortality
to.
But, during the time of our trouble---a time that
I now regard as the happiest, and most truly
productive
of our lives,---it was my misfortune to be
employed
in some negotiations, that grew out of them.
Yet my temper was not of the right sort. It would
not brook a great deal of kicking and cuffing, even by
implication, without kicking and cuffing in turn.
Among others that I saw, not to wheedle; not to
intimidate; and, still less to
be
intimidated by, was a
Mr. Termor. Somehow or other, he had become our
creditor; by endorsement, I believe. I waited upon
him, with the smooth tongued financier, my partner,
bearing the assignment in my hand. Our interview
was short: and much in the following fashion. But
you should first understand, that he is an uneducated,
strong minded vulgar, honest man, of ungovernable
temper, and handsome property. Yet, I dare say, with
a
likely
heart, as you say in New England.
Pardon me, said I, we never apply the word in
that way; we say, a
likely
man.
That paper, said I, (Hammond is speaking,)
handing him the assignment, and laying my hat upon
the desk---contains a relinquishment of all our
property
,
for the benefit of our creditors. Those who
sign will get their share; those who do not, must take
their chance, and
Why, how now?---What the devil's this? hey?---
said he.
I repeated the thing, in a very respectful manner----
Don't understand it---don't understand it
must
(spit) sign it---must I? d---d if I do---. By God,
sir(spit.)
This was courtly, to be sure; but I was never
much accustomed to tolerate such a carriage, even in
the rich and ignorant. So I told him very plainly,
that, if he expected to get a farthing, he
must
sign it.
Come here, said he, d'm it---(spit) come here;
(spit)
By---G-d---; come here, and buy my goods---
here---! hey!---
must
sign,
must
sign, hey--damn'd if
I do!
The blood was starting through the man's face, as
he said this; and I, utterly weary of such vulgarity
and arrogance, looked him, I am afraid, in the eyes,
in a way that did'nt much please him;---replaced my
hat, with a flourish, upon my head, as I did so; and
halted, leisurely, out of his counting room.
You can have no idea of his tremendous passion---
after I had gone; and long, and long afterward, it was
near to the bursting of a blood vessel, for him to meet
vol. ii. I
me, particularly, as he swore that I rode the
handsomest
horse in the city, on which I, the
hump-backed
rascal, as he called me, had well nigh ridden over
him.
Nay---he never will forget my parting look, I am
sure; for thrice since, when he had forgotten
me
, the
resurrection of that, hath shaken him like a battering
engine. Once, I was in the theatre, talking busily,
to some ladies, in a box, next to some other ladies, of
the patrician order, upon whom it was not lawful for
me to set my eyes, except at second hand. Mr. T.
was talking with them. I saw that he was struck
with my countenance (he did not see my person; for I
stood in a shadow, and wore a large blue watch
cloak.) He listened to me, also, with evident
pleasure
,
though with some perturbation; and I, like an
experienced coquette, played off my very best
conversation
,
in such a way, thatwhy should I deny ithe
appeared astonished, delighted, and willing to talk
at
me, as piqued lovers sometimes do, you know,
through
a third person
at
each other.
At last, I saw him lean forward to one of the ladies;
and heard him ask my name.
I turned immediately, and lowered my forehead, so
that he could see nothing but the twinkle of my eyes,
with the intention of seeing how he looked, when he
heard her answer.
My name was pronounced; and the man
absolutely
turned pale, and shook with passionand shame, I
am sure.
And, at another time, when he had forgotten me
again, he saw me enter a court room, where several
persons who, one year before, could not have been
made
to know me, were especially polite to me. He
remembered my countenance, but not
me;
and made
me, before he recollected himself, a most gracious
bow. I knew the manand, as I returned it, I
elevated
my eyes slowly to his, with the very same devil in
them, I am sure, that he had seen, years before, in his
counting room. The blood rushed over his whole
face; and his hands shook upon the table.
We have never met since, and, probably, never
shall meet; but, at this very hour, if I wanted a
favour
,
that I would not ask of any other man, I would
go to himpretty sure, for he
is
generous and manly,
that I should not be disappointed.
That would depend, said I, much upon the
nature
of the favour---if you wanted your throat cut
now, or---a halter.
O, no, he replied, smiling; I am very serious.

story, in your own way,
first
.
It
was after midnight, when Hammond concluded
the conversation, related in the last chapter; but the
following night, he renewed the subject.
I have already told you, something of a man,
named
Galligan.Do not forget, that he was no friend of
mine, in any shape; he showed me no favour; and at the
time of our failure, was the first to secure himself, with
notes and paper, in preference to
goods:
Yet, he became
the most malignant, wicked, and unsparing, of all our
persecutors, for having followed his advice. I do not
mention his real name, because he is old and
wretched
,
now; and has a fine family.
We have, as I suppose you know, an insolvent law,
in our state. Of this, I finally availed myself, in a
feeling of desperation; indignant at the baseness, and
shuffling of the men about me. A creditor, under this
law, has, until two years after a discharge granted, to
file, what are called,
allegations
, against the debtor;
and these allegations are usually of fraud, or
embezzlement
,
which, if substantiated, leave the debtor subject
to perpetual imprisonment.
The first thing that irritated old Mr. Galligan,
was the
letter
, of which I spoke; he always felt, when
it was mentioned, as if
that
had wheedled him out of
all his money; yet, in truth, he had little to complain
of; for I do believe, that, including all our purchases, and
payments, he could not have lost by us, though he had
given up the balance of his claim; the next thing, was
the utter ruin of several new houses, whose paper, he
had selected, with a sagacity, peculiar to an experienced
trader; for he knows that,though a man be a scoundrel,
he will generally pay his first
note
.In securing
himself
,
Mr. Galligan had selected the
first
notes, of
several
new houses; all of which, we afterward discovered,
were linked together; and all went by the board,
at once! This fretted him to madness. But there
was another event to increase the exasperation. In
the multitude of our concerns, there was a valuable
estate, in New England, upon which some thousands
had been expended, first and last,out of the joint fund.
Both of my partners were interested in it; one, of his
own right; and the other, in right of his wife. But, in
our season of difficulty, we had tried every possible
means, to raise money upon it; and always in vain; for
it was encumbered by an able conveyancer, with a
widow's
dower, and the maintenance of a large family.
In plain truth, as we had been unable to raise a dollar
upon it, we did not consider it worth a dollar; and,
when we proposed the assignment, for the benefit of
our creditors, we omitted that estate. Yet, soon after,
when it was necessary to give in our schedule, upon
oath, we were more particular; and, although we did
not believe the estate worth registering, still it was a
claim, or right, and we, therefore, gave it in.
But, the indefatigable Mr. Galligan was not to
be appeased in so simple a way. He, therefore,
inclosed
an one hundred dollar note, to a lawyer, in the
neighbourhood, and ordered an attachment, or
execution
,against
our interest in the estate; or so much of it,
as our concern were entitled to. It was sold; and
the nett proceeds, at public auction, were somewhere
about twenty dollars! We laughed heartily; and who
could blame us, when we heard of the matter.
But the old man's wrath still burnt on, night and
day; and, as if it were not enough to drive three men, to
beggary and starvationtwo of them, out of their only
means of livelihood, he set calmly about driving the
whole to suicideby blasting their characters. His
first step was to file allegations against me; of
what!
I was startled at the convulsive, agitated, deep tone
of Hammond, as he concluded these words; and
looked
him up on the face. Never shall I forget his
expression
never!
It was just as if his great heart were
vol. ii. I2
half crushed, all at once, under the thought; as if it were
worse than death, to have been suspected of any thing
wrong, mercenary, or dishonourable.
What did he allege against you? fraud! said I.
Fraud!
fraud!
echoed Hammond, grinding his
teeth, while the sweat stood upon his lips; and his eyes
grew blood-shot, like those of a chafed catamount
and a bitter smile went over them. Nohe dared
not. No!I never knew what they contained.
Never
!
they
were got up in secrecy; and, with the
management
of one that dared notaye, that dared not
confront an honest man;they stood against me, for
nearly two years, without my knowledge. Time and
again, had I heard the rumour, that allegations
were
filed against me;again and again, had I gone to meet
them, but no, they were not to be found. At last, God
give me patience!I discovered the trick. It was
done to blast me;dishonour me, secretly, without giving
me an opportunity for defence. Who would care to
know, whether they were ever answered, or the hand
accursed, and withered, that had written them? Who
would ever have known it? Nobody. Yet, all the world
could easily learn, that allegations had been filedand,
though they never came to trial, that were enough. To
have been arraigned, though never tried;---or, if tried,
acquitted
, were enough to kill a proud heart. Yet, I
have a proud heart, and it did not kill me! I
compelled
the counsel of the oppressor to do battle, over and over
again, until there was no ground left, for him to stand
upon. Thus ended Mr. Gallagan's last hateful
attempt
at vengeance. And what was the effect? To
drive me away, all my life, from among merchants;
to teach me a reliance upon myself alone. I could
tell you more of these thingsmany more particularly
of a scoundrel in New York, who has twice arrested
one of us; and taken from him his very travelling
trunk. O!is it not shameful? Had we been
dishonest
,
we could have kept back a hundred thousand
dollars, from the wreck of our affairs; but no; we
turned
ourselves out into the world naked, pennyless,
literally
pennyless!
But, (his voice faltered a little, and there was
less sternness in it, than before.) They were not
inaccessible
to misfortune.
He
was not. I told him so.
I went to him, once!--By heaven, the spirit of prophecy
was upon me! I went to him, with my proud heart
swelling, to pray that he would not imprison my elder
partner, who was in such a perilous situation, that it
would be death to him. Yes! I prayed to him; but he
was obdurate.
It will be but for a little time, sir, said I, in a few
weeks, he will be discharged. It will be death to him,
and all his prospects, if you send him to jail. He will
not give bail---he cannot.
Then let him go to jail, was the reply.
I felt for a moment, as if I were choking; but I
remembered that I was a petitioner; not for myself;
and I proceeded, so mildly, that he turned upon me,
as if doubting his own ears. He will die there,
said I.
Let him die---then! was the answer.
Old man!
said I, unable to keep down my wrath
---he trembled---
Old man!
I locked my hands, I
remember
;
and I spoke with all my heart and soul.
There is none of us inaccessible to misfortune! Even
you---
you
, may be visited next;---and, when
you
are a
suppliant---nay, I feel it hereI feel it!I shall live
to see youand O, how devoutly do I pray it!
shaking
with the same terrour; humbled in the same
supplication
.
To jail with himto jail, he shall go, cried he,
inarticulate with passion.
By God! said I,
he shall not go to jail!
Nor should he, though I had gone out upon the
high way, with a pistol, to redeem him.
William Adams, look at me; put your hand upon
my forehead; what feel you there?
A hot fire.
No beatingno rushing?
Aye, it beats mightily; and the rush is that of a
sluice, newly opened.
With what feeling, think you?
Wrath and hatred.
You are mistaken. It is compassion. My wrath
is gone by; my hatred is extinct. That old man
has
been visited since
has been
wrecked, even in
reputation
;
[7]

of the man is not

Ed
.
and, if living at this moment, is delirious. Who
would not pity him? I must; for I feel as if my own
prayer may have brought down a portion of this
great sorrow and humiliation upon him, and his
family
.
Then why do I mention it? That you may know
me, truly, and as I am; one that has been goaded
onward
by ambition, with poisoned arrows
one
, who, if
he paused, had died, of a broken heart; and one
thanks be to Him,that hath upheld me; who hath outlived
his persecutors, as he told them, that he would; and
already
stands, where they would never have believed that
he could stand.
But did you not foresee this, certainly, before?
said I.
What! our
failure?
No, and so little did I suspect
the ultimate insolvency of the concern, that, while I
was paying off all the world in goods, I forebore to
pay my own mother; a poor widow woman, a few
hundred dollars, that I had collected for herthinking
it safer for her to wait the issue, than to take goods.
The obligation was sacredthe money was not mine
it was her all. A poor widow woman---my own mother!
Do you think that I would not have paid her, if I had
suspected any danger? By heaven, I would, if it had
cost me the sacrifice of fifty thousand dollars! Aye,
and my heart's blood into the bargain.
But, you would know, it may be, if there have been
no noble hearts in my journeying, to beat loudly with
encouragement to mine. There were. Let me do
them justice. Some have been my friends, through
thick and thin; through cloud and shine. Them
shall I never forget. Some have come out boldly, and
spoken in my praise, while I was unknown to them.
They
shall never be forgotten. Some few have lent
me books, and treated me like a man: and two or three
have been to me like brothers. But, chief among them,
was one who, stout hearted, like yourself, William, had
a hundred times your wisdom; and while he rebuked
memade me better, even while he rebuked me. He has
been my friend through all vicissitude---yea, even where
I have deserved to lose him.
And is yet? said I, doubtfully.
Yes.
Then why seek another?
Because he is older, better than I---married---and,
having duties to fulfil, that are incompatible with such
friendship as I require, at this time.
But let me tell you what he is. He has been my
adviser, counseller, and true friend, for years; daring
to tell me of my faults; shrinking not from authority
or peril, when my rebellious nature awoke too
stormily
before him---setting his foot upon my vanity; and
deriding my vain glory. And whenpardon my
incoherency---when this man, after a change in his
favour, had barely enough for the subsistance of his wife
and babesstill anxious that I should be, what he
always
foretold that I
should
be, if I toiled patiently, for
ithe would have pressed upon me a portion of that
little, till I was enabled to enter my profession. O, my
friendit
is
bittervery bitter, to be pennyless, at my
age, after having been really independent!to begin
the business of life anewat the very alphabetand
threshold; to throw by a trade, that has employed all
the best years of your being, and begin another,
unfriended
and alone! Yet, I dared to attempt this. I
began to study the law. Few people could believe
that I was serious: and fever still, that I would persist
in it. All admitted that I had geniusbut none, that
it would ever be productive. What a pity! they would
say, that he cannot workthat these geniuses never
will work. William Adams!I sat down to my table;
---and for, five years, did I toil, literally, night and day.
I was a poet. And men said that I should live and die
a poet. That was enough for me. I abandoned poetry
for ever. I wanted patience, they said. I sat down to
my profession; and went through a course of legal
study, that was calculated by an eminent and
industrious
lawyer, for ten years. Particular parts of the
law, I was told, I should be unable to master. I
never rested, till they were as familiar to me, as my own
name. Languages were difficult. I was told that I
could never learn one, at my age. I learnt six,
without
stopping. It was difficult to write wellit
required
patience---talent. I wrote books, therefore, of one
kind and another; and supported myself, even in
America, wholly by my pen, for nearly four years of
uninterrupted toil and study---having written and
published
,
within that time, beside all my other studies,
what would make, at least, twenty-five duodecimo
volumes.
Was not this enough? No---come to my study, and
I will show you manuscript; evidence, in black and
white, that, had I done nothing else, for the last five
years, would earn for me, the name of an industrious,
if not that of an unexampled student.
Buthad I no friends?none. Let me tell you.
First, I was haughty; I could not brook an obligation
The time would come, I thought, when it might pain
me, to hear any man say--But for me,
he
would never
have been what he is. It was I that lifted him.
Was that right, Hammond?said I.
Yes---I feel that it was right; but, let me proceed.
I have been put under some obligation, and I cannot
breathe freely, till I have told it. In the first place,
there was a man, who, when I was very forbidding,
cold, and haughty, had the wisdom to look into my
heart, and to seethe truth;that I was proud,
because
I was poor; and would not be mistaken, by any
possibility, for one that sneaks and bows to better or
more powerful men. He was a lawyer; and he
treated
me like a man. To most of his profession; to all
indeed, but one other, I was an intruder. And the
merchants
regarded me, as one that had got above his
business---the lawyers, as one that could never
rise
to
their's---heaven help them!---but was doomed to perish,
between hawk and buzzard! But this man had the
courage to throw open a magnificent library to me.
To him, am I chiefly indebted; for he, it was, that
dared
to do this,
first
. And, next to him,--my friend!my
heart leaps in my bosom, at the recollection of another!
---was a gentleman;---one of the best Advocates of the
United States; a fiery, impetuous, headlong fellow---
with a mind singularly active, brilliant, and keen
sighted---truly eloquent, but exceeding passionate and
electrick. He took me directly into his office;
treated
me like a friend; a companion; imposed no
drudgery
upon me; left me to make use of his name, in any
way that could be serviceable to me;---and, in short,
suffered me to go abroad, with the reputation of
having
studied with him;---and all this, without any
reward
,
bribe, or compensation. Shall I ever forget
him!no. And the time will come---yea, it
shall
come, if God spare my life, when I will
prove
my
gratitude
to him, by better proof than words; and when
he shall rejoice that he did this. I--it shall be his pride.
But---did you receive no pecuniary assistance
none at all? You had a rich uncle.
He offered, repeatedly, to assist me---but his offer
was as constantly rejected; until I was, at last, on the
point of translating a French law work of two volumes,
octavo; which I had offered to do, in sixty days; and
add my own notes, of from fifty, to one hundred pages,
that should be submitted to any lawyer of the county
---for two hundred dollars. He interfered; and
prevented
me from wasting any more time in literature,
by lending me, in one way and another, somewhere
about the same sum. More, I might have had---for
his heart was full, when we parted---his generous
countenance
flushed with feeling---and his hand trembled.
Draw
on me, William, said he---draw on me!
and looked, as if I might have drawn on him, for his
heart's blood.
And was this all!How did you support
yourself
?---how
could you---so long?
Yes---it was all---as I have told you, by making
books.
But how could you make books, and pursue your
study of law, languages and miscellany?
O, there was no difficulty in it. It did not
average
an hour a day, the labour that I gave to
book-making
.
What!---in America,---support yourself with
working
one hour a day, for the publick!
Yes; and at this time, I feel assured that I could
support my self and a family, like a gentleman, by the
same business.
What! by authorship, where we are proverbially
penurious, in our reward of native talent; slavish in
our prejudices; and at liberty, to publish the best of
foreign productions, after their reputation is
established
,
without any expense for the copy right. How is it
possible, for an author here, to enter into competition
with all the authors of Europe?
I cannot stop now, to explain the reasons in detail;
the chief one is sufficient. We are beginning to have
respect for ourselves; and to be,
for that reason
,
respected
abroad; and, it is my firm belief, that the time
is fast coming, when it will be a better name for a
literary
work, to call it
American
, than
English
, or
Scotch
. The fashion of reading what our country men
write, is gaining ground, every day. What was Scotch
literature, twenty-five years ago?the derision of the
English. What is it now? Their terrour and delight.
But what put it into
your
head, to commence
authorship
?---you
had no education.
Patience, for a moment; and I will tell you.
Allow
me first to say, in justice to mankind, that there are
better and brighter; aye, and warmer hearts, among
them, than we are sometimes ready to believe, when
darkened by calumny, or roused by disappointment.
Three or four, have I already mentioned; but,
there are a few others. One, a poor man, whom I
had occasionally seen; a sick man too, who had gone
to an exteme southern climate, for his health; and
wanted, as you may suppose, every dollar that he
could muster, for himself. He had the generosity to
offer me a sum; not very considerable, to be sure, but
much more than he could well spare, to be repaid,
when I pleased. Another, an iron-hearted man, and
a little mercenary, I had thought, before, came to my
office; and looking me awhile, in the face, sat down,
in considerable perturbation.
Pray, what is the matter? said I; you look
troubled. He hemmed and hawed; and adjusted, and
re-adjusted his legs; without speaking.
You have head something unpleasant, that
concerns
me, I said. Speak out; whatever it be, I can
bear it. Do not distress yourself about it. Out
with it.
Want any money? said he.
Money!
I cried; startled at his abruptness;---
money
!
What do you mean?
Do
you
want any money?---that's all---do
you
want
any money? If you do, say so; he repeated.
What could I say? The tears came into my eyes.
No;
said I;
no;
but I thank you. I thank you, from
the bottom of my heart. It has given me a better
opinion
of human nature. I do not want money. I have
undertaken a profession, in the face and eyes of all
discouragement; and I will make that support meor
starve.
Here Hammond paused for a while; and I took up
the conversation, and questioned him.
What! said I, did you abandon
writing?
Yes---altogether, in the way of a support. I
scribbled
,
occasionally, for a journal, or a newspaper; but,
without fee or reward.
Was it prudent? Your profession was precarious.
Your laws are dilatory. Two or three years, I am
told, often pass, before a verdict is had; and, sometimes,
five or six. Clients seldom pay in advance; and
rarely
,
I suppose, to young practitioners. How were you
to live?
I hardly knew; I confess. I thought of all that;
but I knew, that, to be great in anything, one must
confine himself to it. I was willing to be a
lawyer;
a great one---and I knew, that I could not be
that
, and
an author too.
But did you love the law?
Love it!---yea....more truly, than Csar ever loved
war. It was a passion with me:
is
yet: and will be.
I love it, as the school of eloquence, power, dominion,
the fountain of legislation, politicksthe trial place,
for senators and statesmen.
Love
it! Aye, next to
vol. ii. K
my Godas the only thing capable of purifying, and
exalting my naturegiving scope and elevation to my
faculties.
Love
it! What! Could I have sacrificed
every other passion, every other pursuit, every other
desire of excellence to it; and that too, with the chance
of starvation, at the threshold, had I
not
loved it!
---worshipped
it.
But you continued to write.
I did not. I abandoned writing. And, when I
returned
to it, it was when other men were revelling---
when all the world were asleep;--and then, not as to a
labour, or a study; but as to a relaxation. It was
excitement
and intoxication to me---with the eye of God,
only, waking above me. I felt, under the blue
midnight
,
more of that heated and beautiful, passionate,
sweet thrilling, all through me, with my own pen in
my hand, and my paper before me, than other men, in
the banqueting hall; at the gambling tablethe place
of dancing, dissipation, or festivityyea, more than
them, that slept quietly, in the arms of beauty!
How could this be?
I'll tell you. Have you ever been sickor
imprisoned
?
Aye; both.
Well....do you remember the tumult in your blood,
when you first came out upon the hills, and saw every
thing in motion about you....the tree tops....the grass
....the great waters....the birds....and the
countenances
of men. Did you not see a thousand beauties, that
you never would have seen, had you not been sick and
in prison.
Undoubtedly....I felt like a disenthralled spirit
I.
SirWilliam Adams. The man that goes out,
with a right nature, to worship his Maker, after he
has done all the duties of the day, to his fellow man
meets with wonders and miracles, at every step. At
the beginning of the day, he hears armies in motion
the four corners of heaven striking their tents. At
noon, he sees a world encompassed, by embracing
cherubim, whose plumage is what men call sunshine,
rolling over the unfathomable depth of heaven. At
sun-set, he sees the whole ocean, of a wine colour
and more transparent, than any wine; and looking down
into it, with a miraculous organ
down
, to the very
bottomhe sees the golden Serpent, and the green
Water-Dragon, evolving there, continually, among the
scarlet coral, and great rocks of carbuncles.And at
nightO, God! what does he not see, when all the
stars of Jehovah are abroad, upon their mission! How
could this be? Because I husbanded my enjoyment.
It could well befor I made these hours dear to
me, by variety. I bought them with pain, and toil,
and travailthe agony and throes of my intellect
and I husbanded them, like an experienced
voluptuary
.
Did you visit?
No.
Frolick, in any way?
Noexcept on paper, and alone.
Had you no friends to visit you?
NoI would not permit it. My time was too
precious
.
I took a room, in the very outskirts of the town,
where most that knew me, were ashamed to come; and as
for other men, it was too far; and by too bad a road.
There, I lived, alone; walking into town, often, twice
or three times a day, loaded with books, like a pack
horse.
Butbefore I forget itthere were other men, like
theseand one, in particular, who knew me not; but
prompted by his own noble heart, knowing no evil of
me, but by report; and some good, of his own
knowledge
,
he had the manhood to come out, once, and
throw down his gauntlet, in an assembly of men, who
were bitterly prejudiced against me. I knew it not,
till afterward; but
I have not forgotten it
whatever
he may think.
But you spoke of your poetryI have been reading
some of it since our last conversation, said I.
You have! and what do you think of it?
Not much. Don't be offended with me---but
Offended
with you! no, indeed; every man has a
right to his own opinion: and surely, you, who have
written poetry, have, at least, as good a right as
another
,
to express it, with freedom. Beside all that,
you are my friend; and, I might suspect your
sincerity
,
or partiality, or judgment, if you
praised
it.
You look a little angry, nevertheless
Indeed, I hope not. I do not feel angry. I am
only very much in earnest. But you are not the first,
who have mistaken my exceeding earnestness, for
want of temper. However, now, that we are upon it;
allow me to tell you something, that may be of use to
you. You have not a pure taste in poetry; and you
want independence.
Oh!just what I might have expected! That
judgment of me, is in retaliation. You say that I
want independence and taste, because I do not praise
your
poetry!
Yesprecisely. I do not skulk at all from the
inference. I say, at once, that
any
man who can read
my poetry, without being carried away by it, now and
then, is neither a poet himself, nor a judge of poetry.
Don't look at me so. I am profoundly in earnest;---
the more so, I dare say, because, at this moment, I
do not care one fig about my reputation as a poet. I
forget
myself
, entirely.---I am talking of myself,
precisely
,
as I would, of another; as if I were an abstract
idea; and my poetry a mere supposition. Again, I
say, that if you do not tremble, and gasp, over some
passages in my poetry, that you are wholly destitute
of the poetical taste---or miserably deficient in
courage
,
(why do you start?)
moral
courage, I mean; and
independence. Nay---let me tell the plain truth.
You would think far more highly of what I have
written
,
if you did not know me, at all; or, only by sight.
And why? Because you wish to avoid the foolish
partiality of friendship; because you have seen the
senses of other men so blinded and perverted, by their
partiality, for one, whom they knew and loved, that
they could see
no
fault at all, in any thing that he did.
You, in avoiding that folly, have run into a far more
mischievous one. A truly independent nature would
be honest, bold, and discriminating; it would discover
faults and excellencies, alike, in every page, on
account
of its own friendly anxiety and love, which
would never be discovered by the common reader.
I grant that fools praise indiscriminately. But wise
men never
censure
indiscriminately. It is always a
very easy thing to say, that such a work is
wonderful
,
or such a man great; but the difficulty is to point
to the very placeto put your finger upon it; where
the one is great, or the other wonderful. It were
easy to say, that a thing is marvellous; but the
difficulty
lies in proving it---in giving a reason for it. You
are too indolent for either. Did you not know me;
and, were any thing that I have written, to fall in
your way, by accident---or, as coming from abroad,
you would entertain, altogether, a different opinion
of it.
You are mistaken, Hammond.
I am not mistaken. My friends have never been
able to endure any thing that I have ever written---
after they once
knew
that I had written it. My
dearest
friends have thrown by, volume after volume, of
my prose and poetry; when they
knew
it to be mine;
with an alacrity exactly in proportion to their
certainty
of its being mine. It is really true. When I
have been praised,
in every case
, it has been by
people
,
altogether unknown to me; whose faces I had
never
seen; whose names I had never heard. But I
have been most cruelly abused, and admonished---
privately, and publickly, by my
avowed friends
---most
of whom had the impudence, to declare, at the same
time---as if to give their criticism, all the weight that
they could; that they
loved
and
admired
, and
respected
me!
---while they damned my
writing
. Only once or
twice, have I been spoken highly of, by any personal
acquaintance; or any critick, after he came to know
any thing of me, apart from my works. In general,
I have never permitted
them
---and, in no case, have I
ever requested them, or
anybody
, to praise me, or ever
speak of me. NoI am wrong, I have twice
requested
people to show me no mercy.
I could tell you some pleasant things of this
kind. Perhaps they are afraid of spoiling me
VOL. II. K 2
of turning my head, by praise. Ah, they little know,
me, if they think that any body could raise me in my
own opinion, in any way. I wrote a poem once. A
perfect stranger, a man of great talent, but no judge of
poetry, spoke in the highest terms of itand,
particularly
,
of the prefacewhile another, at the same
moment
,
who happened to know me, denounced the
preface
as the very devil, for wretched writingand the
poetry, as not much better. With the former, I
afterwards
became
somewhat acquainted;
and lost his good
opinion by it,while the first, who did'nt happen to
see me, for a long time, came to have the highest
regard
for me! I then wrote a tragedy. The former
looked at ithis heart failed himhe praised itbut,
much as if it went against his conscience. I wrote
several
other matters, most of which he took no notice
at all of, and the rest, he stigmatised, as the most
wretched abortions. Why?because he was my
friend!
because he had'nt the courage to see merit and
power in a friend; because he could'nt believe in the
greatness of a
companion;
and, because he was afraid
to encounter the ridicule of the world, for supposed
partiality. So, with twenty other works. My own
personal friendsthe best of themwould never read
thembecause they know
me
, and love
me
, and
respect
me!
My only sister has done little else, than weep
and blush, for me, ever since I began to write; and my
own mother could never get through a short poem of
mine, written chiefly to please herbecause, she was
afraid of her own judgmentand dared not believe the
thrilling, that she felt in her blood, to be any thing but
a maternal solicitude and partialitythe yearning of
natural weakness, for the offspring of her own child;
while other people, strangers to me, and to herread it
with rapture and amazement. So, with a multitude of
things. I have been most extravagantly praised by
the first men of the ageperfect strangers to me,
in
every case

knowand, in every instanceas they have learned
to love and respect

less and less!by way of
proving their own exceeding impartiality, and
independence
.
You have written a good deal?
Yesfor a man of my agefor I was old, when I
began to write.
Let me know something about this. You have
done
with poetry, you saywhat do you mean?
That I have abandoned it.
Why?
Because one cannot be both a poet, and a lawyer;
andand the fame of the lawyer, is a nobler object for
ambition, than
Than that of the
poet!
Gracious heaven!a
lawyer
!
greater than a poet!
Aye, than any poet that ever lived. I would rather
deserve the reputation of a great lawyer, than to unite,
in my own proper person, all the fame, of all the
greatest
poets, that have ever lived!
You are mad, Hammond. The greatest lawyer
is soon forgotten; the great poet, never.
Poh!nonsense. That is the common slang of
the day. Great lawyers are never forgottenor
Lawyers
,
I might say; for no man can be a
lawyer
,
without
being
great
Attorneys, Conveyancers are
forgotten
:
Lawyers
are not....Counsellers....Advocates are
not.
You have abandoned poetry, then?
Yes
But, how do you mean. Have you abandoned
writing
it?
Yes
It is a shame.
Noit is not. It is right.
It was a passion with youwas it not?
Truebut a subordinate passion; one, that I
immolated
to a nobler one.
Why?
Because, people said that I could not.
The spirit of contradiction, then.
Humph
Had it much influence with you?
Omnipotent. It has made me what I amand will
make me, all that I shall ever be. They said, that I
could
not sit still. I sat, till I almost grew to my seat.
They said that I could not study. I studied, till I
was almost blind. They said, that I was shamefully
deficient in patience. I made an index to a work of
twelve octavo volumes ofofheaven knows what. I
only know, that they contain the substance of every
thing, that had transpired in heaven and earth, for some
years; and would have made about twenty or thirty
common volumes of history; and had actually worn
out the patience of three predecessorsand driven the
most patient man of the age to despairthe most
laborious
work of the kind, I do believe, that was ever
done by man. They thought me presumptuous,
because
I dared to give an opinion, of poetry and
painters
.
I entered the listswrote criticismpoetry,
novels, plays, sermons, law, physick, and divinity.
But you will
write
more poetry?
And publish it?
Yes.
Never. I may write, one day or other, when, the
moon changes, as other men get drunk, for exhilaration;
but never seriously; and I shan't
publish. That
I shall
leave to the consciences of my administratorsor to
their
courage
, I might say.
I do not believe you. You
cannot
leave it off.
Others have told me the same thing. But I have
done with it:
cannot
pshaw!
You,
done
with it! when your very language is full
of itfull, even in conversation.
Is it!---I am sorry for it. You pay me no
compliment
.
It is childish. No---you are mistaken. You
never heard it, in
argument
, from me---never.
I saw that he was perfectly sincere; and yet, it
seemed
to me, hardly possible, that one could disdain a gift
like thatand I said so.
A
gift!
nonsense. Poetry is no gift. It is only a
little quicker sensibility than common;more
irritability
of nervea more inflammatory system.
But the rapidity and beauty of combination, the
O, don't bother yourself about poetry, William. You
know little or nothing about it. It is a disease. Some
minds, there are, into which, when a thought enters, it
is always, with a battalion of associations.All their
peculiarities can be accounted for, by a little more
physical sensibility than common.'
What!Are all men poets, who have this kind of
sensibility?
No, not at all
poets
but poets, painters,
musicians
,
oratorsor of some other profession, where
judgment, patience, wisdom, and perseverance, are
not most wanted;not mathematicians, theologians
logicians, nor mechanicks.
I have read your prefacewhat a rigmarole it is!
He laughed heartily. You are rightentirely
right. Yet it is a pretty fair transcript of my usual
conversation:nay, perhaps, of my character, at that
time. One that knew me welland blushed and
wept, in reading it, said so.
You appeared to talk from your heart; but such
vanity
such
presumption!
TrueI was vain,
then;
and am not much
humbler
,
now. But, I havemore cunning; and
perhaps
, more
wisdom,
now
. One thing, however, I must tell you.
When I wrote that preface, originally, it contained
only
twelve or fifteen pages: but it lay on my table, for
some weeks, waiting for the press. In the mean
time, my eye would glance over it, now and then,
when I was worn out with studyand sat lolling at the
walland I would add an occasional note, on the blank
side; for, in writing for the press, I write only on one
side of the paper.
These notes gradually accumulated to the size of
their present shape; but, unluckily, my
references
were
omitted, as the printer waslike other printers, none
of the wisestand printed text and context, margin
and commentary, pell mell, altogether, page after page.
I am, naturally, the most patient of men; and very
amiable
veryand
full of expedients. So, I went to work;
and, by splicing in a sentence, here; dove-tailing a
phrase there; and lopping off another here, I
succeeded
in reducing the fracture, or dislocation, to its present
shape.
But what, in the name of heaven, could induce you
to tell the story of your disgrace in Philadelphia?
Hark'ee Adams. It has always been a maxim
with me, if I run my head against a post, to be the
first to laugh. If
I
had not told the story, some body
else would, and it would have stuck to me, like a
mortal
discomfiture, to my dying day:whereas, now, it
is altogether the reverse. It is
now
a thousand times
more disgraceful, to the
Athenians
, than to me. Yet,
I cannot deny the justice of your censure. Several of
my best friends were unable to read the preface
through; and my own mother locked up the whole
book, with tears in her eyes, when she received it, and
would not let it go abroad, till she had received good
evidence from me, that the confession was my own;
and that it was no counterfeit or forgery; and had not
been
racked
out of me by terrour or madness.
But how beneath your dignity!
Dignity!
Talk to me of dignity---why! if the
Philadelphians had been left to tell the story, in their
own way, I should never have stood upright---you
smile---I do not mean in body, William Adams, but in
soulagain, while I had life in me:---and so too, if I
had told it with
diguity
.
But what good effect had it?
What good effect! I`ll tell you. It made some of
them ashamed of themselves, and of the city---and
some laugh heartily at themselves, and at the book;
but nobody, at
me
. That was all that I wanted.
Nay, it did more. It made me some warm
friends there; set them to thinking upon their
arrogance
and pretension---and, best of all, drove one of
their reviewers, to a course, that I had been three years
battling with them about---a recantation of a vile and
malignant attack upon the poetry of a friend: (it was
handsomely made;) and a slight, very slight, timid, but
respectful notice of my poem, at the tail end of some
other. I smiled---for I saw what it was meant for---
a playing off---a sort of a dash and somerset to begin
with;something in the way of magnanimity, to set
off a new journal with. Nay---that was not all; for a
man who wrote a satire in
Athens
upon the American
Bards, was simple enough to pay me a compliment or
two, partly in prose, and partly in poetry,
Philadelphian
as he was---for which I thank him;---though I
do assure you that his praise was far less than enough,
to counterbalance the censure of a scape-gallows poet, of
the west, whose book I have never yet seen; though I
have striven mightily; and am told that he has cut me
up root and branch---and that Mr. Southwick, of the
Plow-Boy, had entered the lists, on my behalf. But
I have met with an extract from it; and, really,
painful as it is I am obliged to confess, that---that he
seems a devilish off hand sort of a fellow, though
my
friends wont think of such a thing.
He stopped, and looked at his watchTake a bed in
the next room, William, will you? and, to-morrow, I
will finish, said he. You don't know what to make
of me, yet. I do not wonder. I am so exceedingly
like yourself---contradictory---incomprehensible.

...Vanity...Matters and things in general...Ballast.
We
were scarcely seated, the next morning, at the
table, when the post man brought a handful of letters,
and laid them before Hammond.
You seem to have a large correspondence?
Yessaid he; and one of the least profitable, in
the world; but I shall be done with it. I cannot afford
such pleasure. With the exception of two or three
persons
,
my correspondents are altogether young men,
whom, at different times, I have encountered, in a state
of torpidity; electrified, almost to combustion, by the
contactand put, bare footed, upon the fiery track of
Ambition; of the wholeahwhat have we here
Wallaceby heaven! Well,let me see what
he
says.
He opened it; and, as he read, I saw his
countenance
changelike the tablet of a camera obscura:
every passionevery feeling, every emotion of
his
heart, perhaps of the human heart, went over his broad
forehead, and beautiful mouth, till he threw down the
letter, at lastdashed off a tear, with the back of his
handand cried out
Read itread it, William. I have done him wrong.
He has a brave hearta stout one. I must love him.
Read it! 'tis in answer to that which I showed to you.
I opened, and read as follows:
Boston
.
I have perused your affectionate letter.
Damnation! cried Hammondit is'nt so,he
does'nt call it an
affectionate
letter.
He does indeed.
Well, well, go onI forgive him. It was a good
word to begin a period with; and he does'nt much mind
what the meaning is, in such a casego on.
Your affectionate letter (I heard his teeth grind,
as, I read again; but I went on) my dear Hammond,
with no common emotion. It little matters what the
language of friendship be, so that it
be
the language of
friendship; and I am sure that every word, in this letter
(alluding to
mine
, I suppose, said Hammond, his
dark, melancholy eye, dilating and flashing fire, as he
spoke)breathes it, in sincerity and truth. I must be
allowed
,
however, to differ from you very materially, in
regard to some of the notions and opinions (that) you
have been pleased to express. You have written of me,
as you knew me, two years ago; and as I knew very
well myself. You have continued as others have, to
hold the judgment that, then, was formed;and, as
much of it must have, necessarily, sprung from
prejudice
,
it is not at all surprising, that no inconsiderable
share of it, should have been partial and incorrect.
One of your
classical
periods! growled Hammond,
dashing his arm athwart the table, and sweeping a pile
of rubbish to the floor.
I looked at him for explanation; but he shook his
head, impatiently; and I went on.
I deny altogether, therefore, your assumed
presumption
,
for I cannot believe it to be your deliberate
opinion, that I have been wanting, either in
resolution
or
resisting
power; while I plead guilty to the charge of
flattery
, and a constitutional depression or melancholy.
I have called the former by a very different name; and
its delusions have been so enchanting, that, even now,
it is like the remembrance of a sweet and pleasant
dream.
Beautiful!whispered Hammond.
What you, my friend, have denominated
flattery
, I
have loved as
praise;
and, as I believed it, to be the
uncorrupted
encomium of the good and judicious; the high
and honourable testimony of superiour minds, to
talented
and uncommon merit.
Not English. said Hammond, smilingly
talented!

VOL. II. L
I sought after it with unwearied, and perhaps,
unreasonable
avidity. All that is true. Flattery, if you
will have it so, has made me what I am;
Hammond groaned.
it has been the gilded spur that has goaded
on my ambition, even to the death;
Very
fine! said Hammond.
it has roused me from the stupor of indolence,
and the despair of ignorance.
Well balanced, said Hammond, rather inaudibly;
and with a sneering tone.
it has been my solace, and my support; my
comforter, when the sombre, and heavy clouds of
affliction
swept over me; and my pleasant counseller and
friend, when the sunshine of prosperity blazed and
brightened around me.
More of the heart!more of the heartif you will,
said Hammond, impatientlythat sentence is too
beautiful
,
by half, for one in humiliation.
When men told me, that such an object was
attainable
by me.
What
object?
said Hammond.
though others had failed in theattempt; though,
perhaps, I had never seriously thought of it; from that
moment, the undying energies of the mind were
awakened
,
and nerved to efforts, which even yourself would
have deemed incredible.
Would
I! said Hammond.
Sometimes, I thought (that) this was done in
mockery
;
but, whether mockery or truth, it was an
all-powerful
charm with me.
Written to get in the word
mockery
one of his
favourites
he
never believed any such thing, said
Hammond
.
'Tis most true (that)
I have craved the praise of
fools
.
There!
there!
cried Hammond, locking his hands
togetherthat gives me hope!that is worth all the
rest of the letter. I looked uphis face twitched,
shivered all over, and his eyes were full of moisture.
Because I knew that, in this world, the praise of
fools, is by no means to be shunned. Who are the
many
and the powerful of this world? Who are the
wealthy and luxurious? Who are they, upon whose
unthinking voices, honour and reputation hang?---
Who are they, that build up large houses, and set forth
splendid feasts; and think it no uncommon humiliation,
to turn the eye upon starving poverty
He means
common
humiliation; said Hammond.
though with a mind enriched with a wealth,
beyond
the worth of the stars?
With a wealth had better been left out
beautiful
without that: said Hammond.
I looked at him, in astonishment; so coldly critical,
so utterly awake, to any inaccuracy, though agitated
to death, by his feeling! It was incredible.
Most of all, my dear Hammond; who are to be taught
wisdom? and how is it to be taught fools? We live in
a world of flattery; and, what was true in Sir William
Jones's time, is even true now; that those who please to
live, must live to please.
Poh, poh!contemptible said Hammond.
But I thank God, that I never flattered man, for a
gift; and never sacrificed my truth and independence,
for a single immunity of purse proud venality, or
degarded
high birth.
Nonsense!worthy of Dr. Johnson himself,
articulated
Hammond, through his glittering, shut teeth.
Hang such lumbering melody!
Of the causes of my constitutional melancholy; or
rather, of those which have had a tendency to heighten it.
I forbear to speak. You know enough of them,
already
;
and it is now worse than useless, to scar afresh, the
wounds, and make them bleed, merely for the pleasure
of binding them up again.
Beautiful! said Hammond; that is
natural
that
is the unstudied language of a full heart.
Indeed, one is almost sick of hearing of Melancholy,
now. She is a prostituted divinity; and no longer
walks the darksome grove, clad in purple and pall.
She is disrobed of her attributes; and the beauty, of her
mysterious power, is gone for ever! Every unfledged
babe of divinity

muttering
to himself.
is now called a
melancholy young man
simply
because he wears a neck-cloth of white, wreathed, like
a bow-string, round his neck; and walks with downcast
eye: and has a changeful cheek, of hectick hue. I
sometimes
loathe myself, when I see this morbid corruption,
festering, like a cancer, in the bosom of others: and
when the
affectation
of it appears, I turn away from it,
as I do, from the all fearful imagination of Milton's
hell-hounds, kennelling in the womb of Sin.
The work of reformation that you so earnestly
wish me to begin, from these candid confessions,
appears
to my mind, less necessary than you had reason to
think.
Awkward said Hammond.
The truth is, the more that I have been thrown
upon my own resources, the more palpably Necessity,
with all her dire train of shapes and spectres, have
started up

and presented themselves.
Herself;
said Hammond.
The devil take your interruptions, cried I---losing
all patience. I never shall get to the end of it, at this
rate.
Go on, go on; said henever mind what I say.
I treat myself in the same way.
across my pathso much the more resolute have
I grown; and, like Antus, stronger, from each fall.
Think not, because I have been silent, that your friend
has been idle.
Meaning
himself;
said Hammondbadly
expressed
.
Think not, because he has been slow to confess
the indiscretion of the past, that he can ever be
ungrateful
:
but above all, think not that his professions of
friendship die in an hour, like those sweet and
beautiful
plants, which spring up in the desert, only to perish
under the hot breath of the pestilential simoom.
Very beautiful! said Hammond
very!
I know
something of that blasted herbagethe vegetation of
the wilted heartgo ongo on.
There was a depth and mournfulness in his tone,
then, that made me stop, and throw my eyes upon his
countenanceit was very solemn; but, I obeyed.
The hours of darkness are passing rapidly away; I
think I may truly say, that your best hopes, if not
realized
,
are fast approximating to their goldenest
fruition
.
I rejoice with you, my friend, that you are
rising
so high in popular love.
Pshaw! cried Hammond;
popular
lovepshaw!
I pray God that none of your brilliant visions
may be disturbed by the shadow of doubt; the
abreviations
of time; or the failure of hope. For myself, I am
able to endure, if endurance be for good.
If!
cried Hammondreverently
if
. Does he
doubt that endurance
is
for goodthat it is God's own
appointmentand visiting, which we are called upon
to
endure. If!
but, go on.
to drink of the waters of existence, though the
unfolded snake writhes among its flowers
Ha!that
is
poetry; cried Hammond, locking his
hands fervently; and his delighted eyes glared, it
appeared
to me, for moment, like great carbuncles, with
a coloured fire.
medio de fonte, leporum
Surgit amari aliquid quod in ipsis floribus angat!
Though I have often been deceived by the hollow
breath of false counsel; and falser friendship. Yet, I
cannot but rejoice, that it has so been: even from such
wrecks, we may gather much instruction for the
voyage
of our lives; this, at least, they may teach us---to
avoid the shallow and miseries of others: (full of
confusion
said
Hammond:) and to hold an onward course,
undisturbed by the past, and mindful of the future
only.
What! and disregard the presentno, no friend
Wallace: that is a little too classicalhollow breath
won't dothe wrecks of
what
? said Hammond,
inwardly
.
VOL. II. L 2
Like you, I have grown tired of acquaintances: and
still more, of their correspondence. They are well
enough, in every-day life, because they form a part in
that great community, with whom, it is
fashionable
to be
on good terms. In the drama of life, they play the
inferiour
parts of the dramatis person: but, after all, are
very necessary to its representation.
Truly, and sincerely yours,
WALLACE.
Tautology
, said Hammond.
On the side, a P. S. was written, after the following
fashion: In reading over your letter once more, I have
observed your heavy charge, with respect to your
opinions
concerning the poem, which I sent to you, for
perusal
and correction. They are altogether incorrect.
Noble! cried Hammond
that
is the language of
a man.
I little cared how much you played the severe
critick
with the workit was for my good; and it
has been
for my goodthat is the truth.
Thank God!
said Hammond, devoutly. I looked up
his features were agitatedhis nostrils dilated, and
red with his breathing, like a race horse, leaping in the
wind.
And now, what do you think of it? said he.
Me?
said I.
Me!
do talk Englishwhat do
me
think of it!
I was nettledI know not what to think of him;
said I; but his letter is beautiful.
Yesquite too beautiful. However, I have great
hope of him. There are more errours in it, of
punctuation
,
orthography, grammar, and styleand fewer
careful erasures with a sharp pen knife, than in any
that I have seen of his, for a long time. You smile
but I'll tell you what it is, Williamit is in vain, for
any man to tell me, that the writer of a letter
feels
, when
I find his
is
all dotted, and his
is
all crossed. A man
cannot stop, in the tumult of his heart, to tie a shoe string;
or to correct his writing, any more than his
conversation
;
as well might he stop to tie his cravat, or to pick
his nails, at a fine drama.
He then, who blunders most outrageously, writes
most
feelingly
, I suppose.
Pretty much; he replied, with invincible coolness;
I would have a man write as he talks.
That phrase againit is always in your mouth,
Hammond; what do you mean by it?
Just what I
say
, he repliedI would have a man
write, and read and speak, just as he would converse.
What!when some, who blunder eternally in
conversation
,
can write elegantly?
That is false. No man, that blunders in
conversation
,
ever wrote elegantly. Elegance implies ease and
gracefulness; and he, who cannot talk with ease, can
never write so. A man can no more learn his language
by
writing
it, than he can learn to swim, upon a table.
He must always
talk
first.
Suppose him to be deaf-and-dumb.
Hammond laughed;but answeredthen he will
write
like a deaf-and-dumb man. NayI will go
further
;there
is a certain air of ease about what is
natural
,
so remarkable, that I would undertake to
detect
,
at once, any affectation of
style
, in the writing of
one that I never saw, just as easily as you could, any
affectation in his gait or voice. Nay, I do believe that
I could tell a left handed man, or a deaf-and-dumb man,
by his manner of
expressing
himself,
on paper
.
But suppose that one cannot, whether from
invincible
timidity; want of experience; or, any impediment,
in his speechexpress himself in company, would you
prohibit him from writing?
No!but I would prohibit
you
from calling him a
beautiful or natural writer. There is a witchery; an
energy about
nature
, which are irresistible. One man
may captivate you with a movement, which, in another,
would distress you. Why? because it is natural in the
one; affected in the other. Thus it is with language.
You may listen to one that talks naturally; and your
heart will beat audible time to his voice: You will feel
the sap running through it, like champaigne. Another
may imitate him;a third may use infinitely better
words, yet produce no emotion. Why?with
him
, they
are an artificial language. Yet more. Let me repeat
what I have already said. Read to me the
writing
of a deaf-and-dumb mana wounded oneor one that
had an impediment in his speech; and I will promise
you to discover that there is something wrong in it,
more readily than you would, from seeing the man.
You are amazedbut I am very serious. What
constitutes
the beauty of conversation? Is it not a
certain
simplicitycontinual repetition, either of thought
or languageredundancysuch as the scriptures
perpetually
abound with, in matters of tenderness, or
eloquence
,
or pathos. You can bring tears into the eyes
of people, in conversation. Would you do the same in
writing?
How can you hope to do it, but by the same
means? Would you truss up, the broken and
dislocated
language of the heart; and link it together?and
polish it? You destroy the talisman---the magick was in
its disorder. You must write then, as you would talk;
---with this qualification---
as you would talkupon the
same subject---to the same persons
.
How?---you surely would not have me blunder in
writing, merely because I blunder in talking!
Yes I would. It would stand enregistered against
you, till you are ashamed of it. That is one reason.
But I have a better. I would prefer that a man should
blunder,
naturally
, than avoid it
unnaturally;
as I would
prefer the
natural
, lubberly, slovenly case, of any
human
creature, to
affectation;
as I would prefer a
leftlegged
bow, to the step of a dancing master;---as I would
prefer a sweet girl's blundering a little, in the hilarity of
her soul---to her talking superfinely. Of the first evil,
I should have some hope; of the latter, none.
Then, said I, to meet your opinion of a perfect
style, one should address the populace; write for a
newspaper
;
or a friend, precisely as he would talk.
Exactly!---he replied.
Are you in earnest?
Yes.
Hammond, I will not believe you---what, the
gossiping
of the tea tables---the laboured pleasantry of
the
Stop, William Adams---breathe a little.
The flippancy;--said I---would you prohibit
improvement
?---would
you have a fellow stutter on
paper
?
Patience, my dear fellow. No---but I would have
the improvement begin, where Nature meant, that it
should, in the mind and conversation. I would rather
hear a man blunder in a foreign language, than talk to
me in a set discourse, made up in the closet, from a
combination of grammars and dictionaries. Let us put
the matter to a test. Suppose that you were telling a
pleasant anecdote. Would you not tell it; and write
it; and speak it, (if you
spoke
it at all, in publick) in
the same language?
I was much struck with that remark:and he
continued
.
But suppose that you have to relate a
murder
something
that appals the heart,stiffens the hair
would you adopt a different tone, in pleading to a
jury, before the judge of the land, than if you were
talking
to the same men; having the same object in view;
with the same persons listening to you? If you should,
you would become
unnatural;
and your client might be
hanged for it. Yet all speakers do this. The moment
that they are upon their legs, their voice, tone, emphasis,
look, all change. So, in readingmen never read in
the language of nature;and never speak in it, when
they can help it.
What! would you have a man read poetry as he
would converse.
Yesif he ever conversed in
poetry
. If he read
familiar
dialogue, he should read, in the familiar
colloquial
tone, of every day conversation. Do not your
very tone, look, accentnay, your very pronunciation,
change with your subject? You say to me, on one
subject
,
don't
do sobut, on another subject, you would say
do
not---I pray you,
do not
. Solemnity may be heard
now;---and then, a flippant levity---even in the clipping,
and hurrying of your words: now, you are emphatick
deep---collected;---now, passionate, and thoughtless.
If one read a tragedy; let him read it, as he would
speak
, were he, himself, the sufferer; or the being, in
rea
life, whose part he is reading. The rule is simple. I
do not ask a man to read a scene of wrath and passion
from a great drama; or one of deep, sweet quiet in a poem;
or one of magnificence and solemnity---as he would
talk about his bread and butter---but as he would, if
he, himself, were about to be murdered;---or, he,
himself
,
had been hunted, and set upon, like the creature
in the play;---or, were he sitting by the dear one of the
poet,---who, it may be, was going to her grave, heart
broken, in her untasted beauty, unable to move her
lips; or---were he abroad, with the poet,the
everlasting
skies, blue, blue and boundless---rolling over him---
and the North wind pealing among her banners.---
Will not his voice rise---his nostrils dilate---his eyes
lightenhis chest heave, when he
talks
of such things?
---And would you have him, when he comes to
speak
,
and write of them---take down, and, subdue the glorious
colouring of Nature;---put her beautiful limbs into the
habiliments of fashion;fetter, and lock, and clasp down
the giant, wrist and ancle, upon a bed of iron---lest he
should not pigeon wing
classically
.
I was amazed, I started from my seat. I gazed at
him with astonishment, and dismay.
By heaven, I cried---with the tears in my eyes---
By heaven! Albert Hammond, my blood thrills at
your voice, as to a trumpet call---what are you?---who
are you?
A man!William Adams---A
man!
---untrammelled,
and unfettered by the schools: A man!--that lived, in
ignorance
,
thank God, till his judgment was able to
decide
between good and evil for himself!-- A man! who
had never been taught---kicked nor cuffed, into a
veneration
for anything;---and left, in the strength of his
faculties, to judge of all men; old or young, living and
dead---of ancient or of modern time, without any
regard
to the opinion of others
How full of poetry.
Poetry!
call you that. Manyou do not know
what poetry isit, is something, I must tell you, as I
once did General W. after I had been driven from
definition
,
to definition, by him and his rockets. Poetry,
is somethingof which
you
cannot even form a
conception
.
No. It is not poetryit is something better. It is
down right honesty.
But prayhave not you written a great deal of
what you call poetry? I said.
No.
How much?
Twenty pages, perhaps.
Twenty pages! Why, I thought that you had
written
volumes. There are three or four hundred pages
in the book that you gave me.
O,as to thatI have written two or three
volumes
,
of what others call poetrynay, better than
what they call poetry, in many others.
Not publishedI suppose?
Yes, it is
Where?
Faith, it were rather difficult to tellwith one kind
of truck and another.
Why do you not collect it, and republish it
altogether
?
What?
He stared at me, and I repeated the question.
It is'nt worth itsaid he, carelessly; but, with the
air of one, whose unconcern is not affected; who
means precisely what he says; and does not dream of
being doubted.
Really, Hammond, you are an incomprehensible
fellow. What do you think of yourself?
Should you like to know?
Indeed, I should.
Well thenI think, that, if I live twenty years,
I shall have no equal in the United States.'
I looked him steadily in the eyes, for a minute, I
suppose; and then, seeing that there was no change, or
shadow of change in them, I laughed in his face, very
heartilybut not
so
heartily, as I could have wished.
He bore it with perfect good humour. Look you;
said heyou see what I have done. I have but be
gun. So far, I am only in my alphabet. My course
of study, for the next ten years is marked out. I
know what I am capable of doing. I have an iron
constitution
;
and I can work, three hundred and sixty five
days in the year; sixteen hours a day, without sinking
under it. Can you find me another man able to do
this? You cannotmy frame has been hardened by
toil; I was not put to school, before the cartilage had
stiffened; and fed to death on dainties; and crippled
with study. No! but I was sent out barefooted, and
half naked, to face the northern blast; when the snow
and ice cut into my flesh, like a hurricane of
powdered
glass. I was not nourished in a hot house; or
washed with warm water; but accustomed to clamber
the mountains, before day light; leap through the thin
ice; and buffet the torrent, with my Newfoundland dog
at my side. I am damnably ugly, as you see. What
temptation have I to sin? I am a sensualist, a
voluptuary
.
How can I kennel with strumpets? or gamble
my life away, with fools? I am deformedpoor, and
proudI cannot dance; am not sought after by the
women; and who can interfere with me in the way of
my ambition. Look at me. I can write seventy-five
pages of letter paper in a day
[8]
[8]
But the devil himself could'nt read itwith spectacles
Printer
.
and can read a
volume
of five hundred octavo pages through, with ease,
in one day.
And what do you know of it, when you have
done.
Give me one, and try memore than many a
plodder
,
who would be a month about it.
SirI could have read a volume of Blackstone
through in one day; when the book would open of
itself
,
at the place, where a fellow student had been
reading
it for three months.
But how could you do these things? They are
incredible
.
By systemperseverance. I began to carry the
bull while it was a calf.
How do other people study? I'll tell you. They
go to their room, one week with another, through the
year, about four days, in each week; and sit there,
nodding over their book; talking, or smoking, or
thinking of the last night's debauch; or their next
night's ball, perhaps three or four hours of a day;
during
which time, they think it no light matter to read
twenty or thirty solid pages. By heaven! I would
sooner digest my own heart three times a daywith
all its bitterness, than starve my spirit on such a
rascally
diet.
I'll tell you what I did. I
began
with reading
one hundred pages a dayof law, history, and
miscellany
.
They occupied me the whole day, and evening.
In a few weeks, I found, that I could get through, an
hour sooner. I then read one hundred and tenthen
one hundred and twenty, and so on, constantly
augmenting
,
till at last, it became as easy, for me to read
three hundred pages, as it had been, at first, to read one
hundred. And, for about three years, William Adams,
I verily believe, that, apart from all that I wrote; and
apart, too, from the languages, and some time taken up
in visiting my friendsthat I averaged full three
hundred
pages a day, of law and miscellany.
Heaven, and earth!how could you live through
it!
Hear me through. By system, temperance, and
undeviating regularity. I let nothing discourage me;
nothing elate me; nothing disturb me. I first convinced
myself, that, if I followed the course, which I had
undertaken
,
it
must
bring me out, gallantly, at the end;
and then, what cared I?nothing; though I fell, a dead
body, with every artery split, and tornupon the
place of victory. I had blood in me. I did not ask to
feel my progress every hourno, nor every day. I
did not expect to remember all that I readnor would
I desire it. I never bothered myself with names nor
dates; and was willing to read any troublesome affair,
two or three times over. I never held it worth my
while, to do what was difficult, merely because it
was
difficult
;
nor to load my memory, no matter how retentive,
or how accurate it was, with the names of cases, pages,
or chronological tables; when, after all, I should have
vol. ii. M
to refer to the books, themselves, however certain I
might be, if there should be any dispute; and I learnt,
moreover, that, after twenty years of labour, in
accumulating
a capital in legal science, one must study
hard, to keep his original stock good, and hold way
with innovation. I learned at the same time, that the
sum and substance of all legal acquisition is, after all,
not so much a knowledge of what
is
law, as a
knowledge
of the places, where it is to be foundnot so
much, the power of deciding a question, without
reference
to authorities, as the power of referring instantly,
to authorities. I now feel the advantage of it. I
cannot
study now, as I used to. That is impossiblemy
time is no longer my own. But, still I am going on,
one way and another, in a progress, that startles
nobody
while
it accumulates, surely; and, in a
geometrical
ratio.
But, how could you keep alive? What amusement
had you?
Writing
. When I was weary of every thing else;
spent with toil, and sore about the temples, with
abstraction
,
I would fall to writing; and my blood would
ripple and tingle again, like that of a benumbed
creature
,
asleep, in the sunshine, filled to the lips, with
old wine, and charged with electricity.
But, you surely did not confine yourself to law?
Oh, no!that would have killed me.
[9]
[9]
Yesthe law has been the death of many such a fellowand by
confinement
too
Ed.
By
Jupiter
!no
wonder, that you stared. Coke upon
Littleton
,
Fearne---and such light reading, thermometer at
ninety-five, would soon have put out my pipe, at two
hundred pages a day. NoI read, of such gentry,
only
fifty or one hundredthen, of some other, one
hundred
moretaking care, however, always to begin in
the morning, with that study, which was least
agreeable
to me; and to leave off, at night, with that, which
was most so. This kept me always in tunemy
faculties
never lost their edge. Do you remember Dr.
Doddesly, and his boy?
Father, said the little fellowcrying, take me
up in your arms. I cannot walk another step.
O, yes you can, my childsaid the Doctor.
No, Father, no, indeed;
indeed
I cannot.
Here take my gold headed cane, and ride upon it.
The delighted child took it, and gallopped all round
the garden.
Every faculty of the mind is like that child. Girls,
too, will dance all night long to musick; jumping miles
and miles, without wearinesswho are worn to death
by a short walk: soldiers will travel day after day, to
musick; and people will travel all day long, in
company
,
without being sensible of distance, or fatigue;
when, if alone, or in silence, they would be ready,
sometimes
,
to lie down by the road side, and give up the
ghost. All the sensibilities of our natureall that is
lordly and heroick; beautiful, or wise, in man, is like
these dancing girls and travellers. Amuse them, and
diversify
their toil, and they are never weary, nor worn.
But how managed you to learn so many
languages
?
By learning them nearly all at the same time.
What! all your masters upon you, at once!
I had none.
Whatno masters!
Noyet, I ought not to say that. I took a master,
for a time only, just to get the pronunciationin two
or three languages: the rest, I managed alone.
How?
By discarding dictionaries and grammars, and
committing no one rule or word to memory.
But how could you ever learn one grammatically?
Just as I have learnt my own. Who speaks it
more grammatically? Yet, I do not know one rule of
the grammarand scarcely, a substantive from a
preposition
.
It is incredible.
Not at all. Can you give me a definition of the words
that you use?
Yes.
No, you can`tunless in a bungling way:yet
you never
use
them wrong. Children do the same!
How do they learn the meaning of a word? By its use
and association. They learn to qualify it every day. So
do we. Not one word, out of five hundred, that we
use, in our own language, have we ever looked into
het dictionary for. Children learn grammar the very
same wayby good company and good books.
You would discard grammar.
NoI would teach it, imperatively. But I could
not
begin
with grammarany more than I would teach
an infant to walk by diagrams. The one would talk
very well, and the other creep quite agreeably, and
naturally. I am thinking, though neither understood
what part of speech any word was; or in what latitude,
and longitude his porringer of milk lay; or, at what
angle it was to be assailed.
Thus have I studied languages. I have learnt the
meaning of words by their associationand, in time. I
have been able to read many languages. It is another
thing, to speak them. Then, it would be well for a
foreigner
to take up the grammar, soon after being able
to read. We can read, you know, what we can`t speak,
or write. So we can understand all that an Orator
shall say, without being able to
say
it: many can read
Miltonfew could have written like him.
[10]

I hope so, for the honour of human nature
.
Ed
.
Nothing distresses me so much, as the barbarous
doctrine of the age, respecting education. It is said, that
brass is harder to engrave upon, than sandbut that
the engraving will last the longer. It is a very
pretty
conceit; but, unhappily, a mischievous one, in its
application
.
Lest children should forget easily, they are
made to acquire,
hardly!
Experience shows, I
confess
,
that a quick memory is not generally a retentive
one; and so, with the other faculties. They, that
acquire
with ease, are too apt to lose with easethey are
inclined to be lavish and neglectful. But is it wisdom
to counteract that facility, by throwing difficulties in the
way. They talk of making a child labour; and they set
him to committing a large volume of latin gibberish
with rules, to which the exceptions are more numerous,
than the examples under them: and to tumbling over
the dictionary. And what is the consequence. First, you
make study hateful to him; and, next, an unproductive
toil. He searches for a wordransacks the
dictionary
the
grammarthe
Key
--the irregular verbsthe
declen-sions----and, at last, finds it with fifty different
significations. What shall he do? He can only ascertain
the meaning, by another process of decyphering the
definition; till, at last, wearied and ashamed, he goes
to the master, and hears, what should have been
told
him at first, with a pleasant countenance, what the
the meaning of the word is, in that
particular
case.
By heaven, you might as well set a child's feet in
the stocks; or screw up one of his thumbs in a vice, to
prevent the acquisition, from being
easy
to him, as to
do this. Notake your book. Make him sit down
by you, with another. Read each word; and make him
repeat it. Go over it again. Throw aside the
grammar
and dictionary. Do not let him look into them,
for one year, at least. In a little time, you will find
him able to read, and pronounce, with a facility, that
will surprise you; and an understanding of what he
reads, beyond all your hope. But, do not be foolish
do not expect to make your boy a critical judge of
the niceties and delicacies of a language, in forty eight
lessons. Nonor in five hundred. That is not to be
done, but by a long, and indefatigable application.
Enough, it is true, for the common business of life, may
be thus acquired, in a quarter of the usual time.
What o`clock is it?
Half past four, by all that is hungry!
Pleasant prospect! said Hammond, ruefully. We
dine at half past three. But you won't mind waiting
a day or two, I suppose.
Upon my word, said I, you are the strangest
fellow
.
Do you treat every body so?
Every body!no. To people in general, I say
stopgive me a feeno talkI won't hear a word
I'm busy. No, noyou must take
this
, as especially
civil in me. You smile. What ails you?
vol. ii. M 2
I am thinking; said I. I.
Out with itdon't be bashful.
NoI cannotyou'll think me vain.
Think
you vain. O, noI shall not, indeed.
I was obliged to laugh; there was a something
irresistible
,
in his eyes.
What was it? said he.
I was thinking, said I, that we are strangely
alike.
I retract. You
are
vain now. There is no
denying
it. You allude of course,
not
to any personal
resemblance
;
for you are, really, quite a decent fellow;
but Idamnation!I cannot carry on this pleasantry.
It drives me mad, when I look upon my own shadow.
What! You look terrifiedthunderstruckcome,

indeed.
Were you quarrelsome, I should say that you were
almost the brother of my spirit.
I am.
You!O, noI know you better. You are full of
endurance.
You are mistakenthe sweltering tyger, under the
hottest African sun, is not less so, than I

Well then, there is but one thing more.Were you
ever the slave of a woman?
I am!
said the dwarf, in a voice that went to my
heart. O, it was so passionate and thrilling, that I
would not have had a woman that I loved, hear it, for
all the world.
Is it possible! said I. When? where?
Tomorrow, or, this evening, I will tell you allI
have a load here; (striking his breast, like an anvil;)
a heavy load.
This evening, be it then.

We
met, according to appointment.
I promised to tell you, said Hammond, slowly,
after a silence of half an hour; during which, we had
set together in his chamber, till it had grown so dark,
that we could not see each other's faces; and just then,
the door suddenly opened.
A man entered, and began stirring the fireleave
it, said Hammondbegone, and leave it.
Shall I bring a light, sir? said the servant, in a
tremulous voice.
Nobegone.
No light! said I, involuntarily.
No light! echoed Hammondare you afraid of
the dark?
I know not what I was afraid of; but, I confess, that
I did not much like the opening of the story. Was
he
afraid to let me see his face, while he told it? I was
very silent; and he began.
I promised to tell you, said he, in a voice so deep
and sepulchral, that I should not have known it, had I
heard it in another place; and then he stopped.
I waited some minutesoppressed with an
unaccountable
sensationto hear it again;and, at last,
his breathing had become so loud, as to alarm me.
Hammond! said I, going to him, and laying my
hand upon his headdear Hammondspeak to me
what ails you? What has happened?
He tore away his locked fingers, from his forehead;
sprung upon his feet, with a cry of horrour; and pressed
my hands, to his heart; as if he would crush them, bone
and joint. I could hardly suppress a shriekand, I
observed, that his palms were wet, as if he had been
weeping. What!the Dwarf, weeping!Hammond,
the Dwarf; said I, to myselfO, noit is only sweat,
or bloodit cannot be tears.
Hammond! I said, again to him, as I really felt,
affectionately.
He attempted to risestaggered---and fell back
into
his seat. What! what!was it only you,
William
;
said he, only
you!
Give me your hand!
here! here! (placing it upon his temples, among the
damp hair) do you feel any moisture there?
Yesthe flesh is wet, and the hair saturated.
Locks of the raven, boylocks of the raven!
black, and glossy, as her wingyetWilliam Adams,
they have been touchedthere are grey spots upon
themha!ha!
He was choking.
Grey spots, my boy; in the form, too, of a human
hand!
I shuddered at his voiceand I remembered a
strange appearance upon one side of his head, where
there were several grey locks, lying amid the jet black
hair.
`How happened it? said Iwith a feeling of
mysterious
gloom, that I cannot describe.
Happened it! He came to my bed side, at night,
and stood thereand put his cold hand, deliberately,
upon my headand all the moisture of my brain fled
from the pressure. I awoke!and the feeling of the
hand, as of cold iron, was there, yetanddamn it,
how your teeth chatterwhat are you afraid of! Have
you
, blood upon
your
hands? For shamefor shame.
Look at meyou see how I bear it. I went to bed,
with locks black, black as the plumage of the raven
black as death.I arose, the next day, with grey
hair upon my templesI
I remembered, now, that Elizabeth had told me,
never to speak of that appearance; and, dark as it was,
I fancied that I could see the livid hand of the spectre,
there yet, like an impression upon wax.
It was not griefnor sorrownor old age, that
did it, said the Dwarf, almost inarticulate, and
sobbing
,
while he spokenono!but he came to me, in
my sleep, and hooped my heart round, and my temples,
with rough iron, till I feared to breathe, lest I should
be lacerated.---I knew it all---saw it all--the whole
process, through my shut eyelids; and, on the morning,
when I awoke---I was an old man.
Upon my soul, I could have fallen upon the
creature's
bosom, and wept aloud, at the sound of his
voice. It was like something martial, and alarming,
when he began---but, when he endedah, it was the
mournful, sweet, melancholy, wailing of a fond heart,
broken---not the voice of complaint; but the noise of
one bleeding to death inwardly.
I was willing to turn off his thought from the
affliction
;but
nohe spoke bitterly, like one that could
read my thought, and pity it.
Presently, said hepresently. Let us talk of
something else, awhile. Only one thing, upon this
earth can disturb metalk to me---say something---
any thing---talk!will you?
You are disordered, Hammond, said IYou
have studied, till your nerves are all vibrating with
over tension.
Oh, no
no
, you are mistaken. My time of hard
study has gone by.
But you do study all day long, and nearly all the
night. Depend upon itthat
I understand you. You would say that continual,
and temperate acquisitions of knowledge, are better
than those made by violence, and suddenness. Who are
the wise, and rich?they that have been a long while,
in amassing their wisdom, and wealth. YesI
have
overworked myself. I shall do better. My new plan
of study
is
better.
What is it?
To take up a title in the law; and read every thing
upon it, good, bad, and indifferent, that has been
written
;
and make my comments while I proceedthis
enables
me to detect innumerable errours.
But, it will destroy you.
NoI first do my professional business. That is
the
first
thing. Then, I read a certain number of pages in
the law: and then, the rest of the day is my own, to
employ
on miscellany, composition, or languages.
His tone grew more eager and natural, as he
proceeded, like one that tries to keep up some delusion,
and cheat away the time.
But I cannot understand, how it is possible, to read
so fast.
Habitpracticenothing more. I have read a
volume
of poetry through: and written a review of it,
while another was writing a letter, at the same table;
and I finished, before he did.
But how do you get over the pages? You skip
some.
Not a syllable. Give me a booklet there be any
false English, or even a letter upside down; and I
will discover it, as soon as you. I cannot pass it. That
is a
proof
that I not only read every word, but every
letter. You pronounce every word, in reading to
yourself
do
you not?
Certainly.
Very wellthen you cannot read any more to
yourself
, in a day, than if you read aloud. Now, I
can
read five times as much.
`Not pronounce your words!
Noand what will astonish you yet more, my eye
is in advance of my thought, a whole sentence at a
time. You smile. Are not
your
eyes, in reading,
always
in advance of your voice? Certainly. But how
much? That depends upon your practice. I can read
to myself at least, five times as fast, as I can read aloud.
I save all the cadence, articulation and pauses.
The more that you read, the more will your eye take
in, at a glance, from letters to sentences. The child,
when it begins, can never see beyond the very letter,
which it is made to pronounce. After a little time, it
sees a whole syllable, with the same glance; then, a word
and, finally, more and more, until it can take in a
whole line, as easily as it once could a syllable. So it
is with me. I read by sentences; and yet, nothing
escapes
me. You cannot understand this; but, if you
reflect
,
you will find it quite as intelligibleas your
story
would be, to the reader, who is only able to
spell
. if
you should tell him, that you can see whole words at
once. He would not believe you. You cannot believe
me. But why do you look at me so earnestly; your eyes
are full of compassion and anxipty.I.
I am sure, my dear Hammond, said I, deeply
affected
at the mannerit was so like one trying to
drive away sorrow and madness, by an affected
hilarity
,
that you are nervous, from excessive
application
.
NoNo, I am not,
nervous!
Albert Hammond
nervous! Nono, it is something worse than thatbut
talktalktalkas fast as you canmy blood is
curdlingcome neareryes, yeshush!do you hear
nothingAh!what is that? There! there!Hush! I
told you sonow you will believe me!Hush! hush!
As he said this, he leaped uprightand II knew
not where I was! I felt all the childish terrour of a
nursery
.
Hammond! said I, feigning to be indignant,
while in truth, I was frightened; Come back!come
back! and let us reason together, like menwhat is
this?
What!did he not touch you!didn't you feel the
hand?
Some minutes passed, before I could prevail upon
him to sit down. I stirred the fire then; and his
countenance
in the red flashing of the embers, when the
disturbed
sparks rushed, like a torrent of fire, up the
chimney, was frightful and appalling. Had the devil
himself, been there, he could not have set more
naturally
upon his haunches; or looked through his huge
knotted fingers, with more fiery and troubled eyes.
Thunder and lightning!did I not tell you!
As he said this, he plucked out a handful of his hair and
threw it upon the red hot coals; a quick flash followed.
I began to stir the fire.
Let the fire alone! will you, he cried.
I was angry.
Hammond, said I, you are mad.
And you would leave me, he replied, in a voice
that went into my heart.---I did'nt leave you,
William
,
when you were mad. No, I am not mad. Sit
down and listen to me, patiently. You ought not to
have stirred the fire. It is about his hour; and he might
have been near us, you know. But fear nothing, now
---he is appeased---they are appeased---the hair quieted
them:---No, no, never stir the fire, when you are with
me, at this hour. Why don't you talk?
Do
talk,
William
.
I felt assured now, that he was disordered;---but, as
I had been so, myself, I attempted, for half an hour, to
lead him into some kind of conversation, that would
interest
him; but, all the time, he held my hand like a
vice, to his bosom;---and his breath came out, as from
the furnace of an overlabouring heart.
I shall be obliged to leave you, said I, at last
The pressure grew tighter. I am sure that I have
now found the cause of your illness. Law will be your
destruction. Will you write me, after I am gone?
Yes.
May I depend upon it?
He threw away my handMay you
depend
upon
it!ILook you, said he, recovering his
natural
manner, for a moment---I have told you that I
love you---and respect you. Is that enough? If I
appear
to neglect you, it will be
appearance
only. Do
not misunderstand me. I do not say it, to appease you.
You are my friend. I know itI feel it. Would you
not rather see me ten or twenty years hencea
You talk very calmly of ten or twenty years.
I am obliged to talk calmly of it. It is the end of
my covenant. I am ready to die, then. Do you think
that great men are made in less time than rich ones?---
great statesmen, in less time, than good tailors, or
bricklayers
?
Twenty years are little time enough, to make
any
man master of
any
trade; and I won't be an
understrapper
all my life. Would you not rather see me, ten
or twenty years hence, occupying a higher station in
the world, as an
honest
and
able
man (I do not say
lawyer
,
lest you should think it a contradiction in terms)
though I had talked with you, or written to you, a
little
less frequently; than to see me in an humbler
situation
,
in consequence of a more frequent indulgence, in
what is really my chiefest pleasure, conversing with
them that I love, either with my mouth, or pen?
Yes.
Let me go on then, as I
am
going, night and day; and
give yourself credit for the relinquishment of a portion of
your own right, in favour of friendship and ambition.
The moon now arose, in a troubled, and beautiful sky,
full of scudding and tumultuous clouds; hurrying over
the fathomless blue, like a great fleet, driven over the
ocean, in a hurricane. I could just see his outline---
and movement---but nothing of his features, where he
sat. The whole earth too, was covered with new
fallen
snow.
How beautiful! he cried---`the gallant moon, and
the innumerable stars---the deep serenity of the
revolving
heaven---the profound repose of the whole earth----
the hushed and awful spirit of the universe;all
creation
holding its breath before God. Lord! what is man,
that thou art mindful of him.
Never before had my heart heaved, in worship, as
it did then, while the voice of Hammond arose, louder
and louder, in the darkness, like one dreaming in his
sleep; or praying inwardly.
Go on, for mercy sake, dear Hammond, said I, I
could sit, and listen to you, for ever.
No, no, I dare not, in truth, William. I
dare
not.
He is there; there, in the presence of the Almighty,
standing
upon the wind. No, noI dare not uncase my
heart again. I dare not unbuckle the harness, and
ligatures
about it, lest it should sunder, and fall apart,
for ever. No, I must keep it ribbed in armour; ironed all
around; be temperate, very temperate all my days, and
labour
to make up for lost time; and recover, if I can,
the wasted hours of my youth. I am growing old,
William Adams; and I would not willingly die, till I
had done something, to show my gratitude to God, for
all that hath happened to me, whether in affliction,
shame, or humiliation. And if I doO, if ever a man

slept unquietly in his grave, I shall.If ever the turf
were upheaved; and the spirit of a buried man

out, to weep for his transgression, and shudder in the
cold moonlightmine will! So, if for no other reason,
I pray heaven to spare me yet a little while, and my
friends to have compassion upon me.Come! come!
talk!
But why, dear Hammond, said I, why devote
all your faculties to the law? May I talk upon
that?
To the law! No, I do not. I will not. But, by
this I mean, (speaking very rapidly,) statutes,
precedents
,
reports and commentaries. To them, I shall not
confine myself. But to
law
, in its magnificence and
amplitudecovering all the earth
alike
, just as that
snow therethe mountain and the valley, the rich and
the poorto
that
, I shall; for, to my thought, every earthe
ly science and accomplishment may be made subordinate
to the consummation of a lawyer, and advocate. Nay,
other studies are a relaxation; and, the worn and jaded
mind, which might, otherwise, tire itself with inaction;
or slumber away its power, under pretence of recruiting
it, after a day of toil upon the law, will find comfort,
warmth, aliment and exhilaration, in lighter and more
passionate studies.
But why not write? Why not give to us, annually,
some work of the imaginationthe mere revelling of
your leisure hours?
Perhaps I shallI am constantly writing.
Yesbut I do not mean matter of law, or history,
or politicks.
What do you mean?
Poetry.
Poetry!(he laughed scornfully) my oath,
William
,
my oath! No, I shall never publish any more
poetry.
But you will write it?
Perhaps I may.
You have written.
Not a line, since I said that I would not write any more,
Indeed, William, the thought will run through my heart,
now and then, with a sweet, brief ripple, thrilling, that
I might do somewhat for amusement; though I did not
write poetry. And I have nearly resolved, to set about
something in prose, merely as a sort of receiver for the
luxuriant
vegetation, and brilliant herbage, that will spring
up, you know, in hot hearts, when left untrodden a long
time, to fatten with corruption.
I hope you will, by heaven! said I.
Nay, do
not
swear.
That is not swearingit isat any rate, not
profanity
,
but devotion. But you talk of swearing,
you!
Advice comes with a good grace from
you
, to be sure.
Why should it not? said he. Who has a larger
fund unappropriated than I. It has been
accumulating
for years. Shall I regard it as a special deposit,
neither to be
used
, nor
circulated
. NoI prefer
putting
it abroadit may profit my neighbour, though
it should'nt me.
But
you
are very profane, said I, I am glad that
you mentioned it.
You
make my blood run cold
sometimes
.
Do I? I am sorry for it. I used to be terribly so,
William; and I shake when I look back on the fierce
blasphemy
,
that I have utteredonce, in particular, when
the heavens were all on fire; and I saw my own shadow
in the clear water below meI wonder that the blue
lightnings had not rushed into my heart, all at once,
and exploded there. Yesand once too, when I was
rebuked for it, foolishly, by one that had no authority;
and less diguity; and threatened tooI, I remember
that I took out my watch, in defiance; and swore, till
I was hoarse and black in the face; but that was the end
of it. I, afterward, resolved to break myself of it; and gave
them that knew me, full leave to strike me, where ever
I was, as hard as they pleased, and when they pleased,
whenever I committed an oath. They were glad of
the chance, I do assure you; and, before the week was
out, I was beaten black and blue; for I had an account to
settle with
each
, every day; and often for the same oath.
You will write then, said I.
I may.If I should attempt any thing of the sort,
it will startle you, I am sure. You know my ambition.
I cannot play a light game, even with the battledore
and shuttlecock of the fancy. I know not
what
I
may do; my time is constantly taken up; and
I shall
never neg ect my business;
but, as I trifle none of it
away; and write, I believe, with unprecedented facility,
it is possible that I may attempt something in the way
of a novel, or a history, or law, or physick; or divinity.
So don't be terrified, if you should chance to detect me,
in any thing new, at home, or abroad. YesI will
write you, if we partwhenever my heart is full. You
will remember me, as I shall you. Do that, and it is
all that I askWilliam.
I started broad awake. I looked all about the room.
Yes, it was the voice of Hammond; but how different
my blood tingled with it. Say on, said I.
You asked me, if I were ever in love. Let me tell
you the truth. I have been---once, devotedly---and
two or three times, after a fashion.
The old malady! said I; the true love of a woman,
who never loves but one
at a time
. You are a
believer
in first love, I suppose.
Of course.
That they are eternal!
Certainly.Why what a heretick you are!
I was delighted, at the result of my efforts, and
determined
to keep him, for a time, away from the
subject
,
that had brought us together; and, if I succeeded,
never again, upon this earth, to mention the duel or
the hair, in his presence.
But how do you manage, said I. How many first
loves can a person have?
O, the number is unlimited; but then, you can only
love one at a time! Thus, I love to-dayI am a
woman
I
love, with all my heart and soul; that is my
first love
; and, of course, eternal; but, a year
afterward
,
I love again. I love differently; for, the
passion
is never twice alike; O, then I find that I was
mistaken
before. I
thought
myself in love; but I was
not then;
now
I am. But a thirda fourtha
hundredth
happens; and the first love will always be found,
by a beautiful confusion of speech, common enough
among women, to mean onlythe
last
one. You see
that I am profoundly orthodoxthe creed at my
finger-end
tenets,
doctrine and all.
You are very bitter; said I.
Bitter!pohhow can one be bitter upon women?
Is not a woman's
last
love, always, her
first
love?
Shall I tell you what one, that knows you, has said
of
you?
NoI don't desire to hear it. Why did she tell
you? That it might reach me. She might as well
have told me to my face.
Naybe patientit is no mighty matter, after all.
She says that one would think, to hear you speak of
women
,
sometimes, that they were your scorn and
detestation
;
but that, at your heart, no human being was ever
so passionately devoted to themnone so true to them,
in trial, and in
Stop! cried a voice, close to my ear. I looked up.
An ugly shape stood frowning, with his face almost
touching mine. It was Hammondbut convulsed from
head to foot.
Stop!
said he, more mildly. There is only one
woman
,
upon the round earth, capable of saying that; and
I will not hear her named now. I
He stopped for a moment; turned round, facing the
sweet moon; and, crossing his arms over the back of
his high chair, sat down, resting his chin upon them.
I watched every motionhe would twist and writhe, at
such moments, as if he had'nt a bone in him; and,
oftentimes
,
I have wondered how he managed to get his legs
and arms entangled, as I have seen them, when they
were all in a
snarl;
knotted and intertwined, like fat
serpents
.
He had the faculty too, I have half persuaded
myself
,
of dilating; or, rather, of extending and contracting
them, like earth-worms, at pleasure; for, I have seen
him suddenly start up, and swing his arms about, like a
tall manand then, bundle them up in his bosom like
coiled rattle-snakes.
You know, said he, slowly, that I am not
remarkable
for personal beauty. But it has now and then so
happenedcurse it, how I hate to talk of such things
but
you
must know me, thoroughly; and I
will
tell
VOL. II. N 2
themit has happened, two or three three times, in my
life, that women have been in love with me. William
Adams, you are laughing at me.
No.
You areI can tell by your breathing.
'Pon my honour, I am not. I have known stranger
things.
Yeswomen have loved blackamoorsapes
fourfooted
beasts. William, the breath rattles in your
nostrils
butbutone
evening, I happened to meet a
strange little girl, with melancholy, dark eyes, &c. &c.
&c.that
had been
deeply in love.
I was in exactly the humour for trying an
experiment
.
I had heard, that the heart, sore with recent
disappointment, is most susceptible; that, once
inhabited
by lovethe heart of a woman cannot remain
vacant
;
that, the chambers of the soul,
will
be filled, after
one riot has been had in them; that the incense and
warmth of love, once felt, the spirit of woman lies with
its mouth open, and eyes shut, and hushed heart, for
ever and evercontented, with no other nourishment,
than love. Is it so? you have had experience.
It is
.
I believe you; and, so far as my little experience
may go, I would prefer attacking the proud heart, when
first humbled; the sore one, when just crushed, and
smitten---the cold one, in its first thaw; the tender one,
in its first weeping, than at any other time; that is---I
would prefer to be the
successour
of him, that had first
smitten, crushed, thawed, humbled or distressed it.
If you were in pursuit of a heroine---said I.
Aye---or a
woman
.
But not a
wife
. The women of Byron, for instance.
O, no, he replied; the women of Byron---poh!
they are women for mistresses---not for wives. Byron
has no idea of that sweet, holy, mute, fervourthat
passionate stillness of a pure heartthat, which carries
a woman, with the untrusted, untold, unhinted
affliction
of her heart, into the gravethat!---O, I have seen
it!---her heart was breaking, but her mouth was patient
as death.
Go on;
said I; and my own tears fell upon my hand.
Well, well---I frightened that sweet girl. But soon
after, there was such a melancholy loneliness in her
eyes; her hair was so wonderfully dark and beautiful,
in its wet luxuriance---her foot was so pretty---her
round, sweet voice, so touching and plaintive---curse
it, William, I can't go onI
Don't swear.
Well then, I won't. At first, as was very natural,
she shuddered a little, when the flesh of our hands
touched but, after a time, she began to tolerate it. And
one Sunday she suffered me to hobble along by her
side, in company with one other couple, an amiable,
quiet woman, and a red headed fellow; and to sit by
her under a tree, for an hour or two. I contrived---
it was like filing off one's own fetters with a jack-knife
---to cut the initials of her name, and my own (so that
no human being could decypher them) upon that tree,
beneath which we sat. She was marvellously
disposed
to be sentimental; and the dirty green puddle at
our feet, stagnant with vegetable corruption; and
swarming with insects and vermin, we contrived to
pass off, upon our own senses, for a rivulet of blue
crystal; and the damp turf---with the loose earth,
and a tree full of bugs and spiders, over our head, for
all that is beautiful in a country life. You have been
in the countryafter a long anticipationwith the
holiest passion for rural comfort. Did'nt you feel, as
if you had been running yourself to death, when hard
pushed for money, to drive some slow winded fellow,
to an adjustment of accounts---and then found---look
me in the face, will you---that you were the
debtor
.
How like going to enjoy yourself in the country! You
are obliged to be delighted, enraptured with it, you
know---to be orthodox---or you never will be
permitted
to open your mouth again, in the company of
women---or
to talk of a novel, a poem, or love.
Wading through loose earth, high corn, and wet
grass, after berries, said I.
Aye, and visiting, on some great, unmanageable,
and hard trotting horse, or afoot, over cornfields, and
ditches, through bramble and briarsome
neighbour
living in the next county.
And then, led out to take tea, under what is
called
a bower---an arbour, or some such
contrivance
,
dripping with wet, or smothering you with dust, at
every
blast of the wind---and wormeaten leaves, or
worms.
And bugs, and musquitoes, I added.
Catterpillars and cream---colds, catarrhs---and
rain storms---no books---no conversation---no
company---no
news---no fresh meat, no market.
Let them that like it, live in the country
eternally
if
they can, continued he. But, let me
leave it, now. In time, this girl began to exhibit
symptoms that alarmed me, whenever I approached
her.
Agitated---terrified! I suppose, said I---
very
natural
.
What! quizzing me Adams---by heaven, you
had better set your foot upon a bed of live coals.
Patience, mandon't get in a passion.
As I spoke, the moon broke out, all at once, from
the sky, as if she were descending---shone all over his
face; and I sat, with my hands upraised, to wonder at
his countenance. It was pale as death; and his
blood-coloured
lips were wet and glittering.
In time, I began to tremble too. She was
imprudent
;
and I had just come enough to
my
senses, to feel
that I was dancing upon a precipice. Prepare
yourself
.
I am cautious---not easily deceived---care little
for the love of woman---of some women, I mean. Are
you prepared?
I am.
She loved me!
nay, do not move your hands. I
can see you biting your lip. You do not believe it
possible. Butit is true---ugly as I am, that
beautiful
creature loved me, truly, passionately;---not, I am
sure, as she had loved a scoundrel before, that toyed
and trifled with her innocence---breathed poison upon
her lips,---and death into her heart; but, with a love,
such as I would wish to inspire in a wife; with awe
and tenderness. I was very sure of herand I began
to look about me, in right good earnest, and ask
myself
,
if it were lawful to perpetuate a breed of monsters
what will not love do!I persuaded myself that
it
was
. But her heartcould I trust to it? Her head
---was it such a head, as I should be proud to see, one
day or other, ruling my household; educating my
children
?Don't
laugh, William, I cannot bear it---you
are thinking what they would look like.---I'll tell you
like over-grown toads, squatting about the nursery---
I know it. Yet---I doubt if there might not be some
pleasure in begetting toads---as much at least, as in
begetting slaves---like your Virginians.
What do you mean, sir?said I, in a heat
Sir
I mean this; that your young Virginians, when
hard pushed for money, will run in debt, on a credit of
nine months;
and get all their renewals for nine months.
And what do you infer from that?
This---that they may pay in stock
Stock
---what is your meaning?
Their own flesh and blood, man.Damn it,
William
Adams, don't I know the Virginians?Don't
Iknow that the best blood among them, has mulattoes
and quadroons, for half brothers and sisters.
Hav'nt I seen a fellow there, gambling for his own
childrendeliberately sinning, that the fruit of his
sin, might be born in season, to meet a note? Have I
not seen mother, and babe, at the breast---sold---at
publick auction! Gracious God!what a state of
morality? Do you wonder that a man, humpbacked,
and hateful as I am, should have a passionate longing
to perpetuate himself; to give an inheritance so
hateful
,
to the innocent and beautiful, unembodied, and
unappropriated
spirits about us;as that a stout hearted
Virginian, high in blood, and ready to die for religion
and liberty---should sell the fruit of his own loins to
slavery?
Well---wellgo on, said I---how did your love
affair terminate?
I'll tell you. Just when I felt quite secure of her,
that red headed fellow, who, I had told her once (with
her own approbation) was a foolcut me out. She
had engaged to go into the country, about a dozen
miles; and gave me an invitation to go with her. I
could not---for, on horseback, I have an unlucky
aspect
in
the day light. But I agreed to meet her, on
her return, in the evening,
by accident
. I set out, in
season:---but, missing stays on my road; stumbled, and
swore; and finally, came back to a house, that I had
passed an hour before, to inquire the way. I hitched
my mare at the gate, and waddled up to the door---the
dog set upon me, of
course
the very geese and cats
and the poor mare, terrified, perhaps, at my shadow;
for, like Alexander, I had not dared to let her see it,
when I mounted herslipped her bridle, and set off,
on a fine, free gallop, into the wood. Nothing could
have been more opportune. I am quite a philosopher,
at such moments. So,---I set off after her, half
determined
to cut her throat, or beat out her brains; but
how could I?was'nt I in love?and since Petruchio's
time, there has been little efficacy or sentiment in such
freaks. After some difficulty, I overtook the animal;
forgave her; mounted; and pursued my way, just
exactly
in the pleasantest humour, that ever man was in.
I soon met the party---Mary Anne had a beau at her
side. We exchanged salutation---but hers---bless her
foolish heart!----was quite too stately and freezing
---and, no matter what---it sent a chill to my heart:
and, I was half a dozen times, on the point of setting off
in another direction; but I forebore, and, on we rode,
side by side, without speaking one word, till we
arrived
at the gate.
Good night! said I, sullenly wheeling my horse.
Good night, sir, said she, with a cold
peevishness
.
Home I went---and spent, you may be sure, a rather
uncomfortable night. The next day, I was unable to
think of anything but red hair; and good night,
sir
.
Yet, I was not of a nature to be trifled with; and could
I have been
sure
, that she did not care a fig for me---I
should have done one of two things, before I slept
strangled her red-haired loveror looked her, in the
face, once---but
once
---and left her, for ever. But I
was in doubt. Perhaps, I said to myself---O, how
sweet are such wilful, treacherous delusions!
perhaps
,
I have wounded herlet me give her an opportunity
to tell me soand then, if we
must
part---why, let us
part.
So, the next night, I went again. Red-head was
there; and with that beautiful
tact;
that instinct of
coquetry
,
with which women are born;-- that, which
will set a babe at the breast, if a
female
, twinkling
with her eye, and hiding her head, while a great
lubber
of a boy will look you full in the face, with a stupid
honesty---she began, immediately, to be particularly
attentive and delicate to Red-head, after the fashion
of the very few heroines that she had ever read of----
calling him aside, to say nothing to him, in a whisper;
giving him flowers---with a mysterious word or two---
hang him!
All that was foreign to my taste---in
my
situation,
I mean---how it would have been, in
his
, I know not---and
when I had born it quite long enough, I bade her good
night, in earnest.
About a week after, while I was yet
sore---confoundedly
sore, I heard that she had accepted a ring
from Red-head; and was engaged to be married to him.
I staggered, or rather, my heart did---within me,
at the news. It was not that I cared so much about
losing
her---or that another should
win
her. But, it
was, that I had lost her in such a way; and to such a
fool. At first, I thought of counteracting it:---but
that, I soon found, to be unworthy of me; a few hot,
hot, scalding tears fell from my eyes,---when I thought
how mightily I had been abused;---how deeply I had
loved her---and how utterly unworthy of my love, she
had been---and then, it was all over. By heaven!
Adams, much as I loved her; so truly great and pure
was my love, that, I do believe, I should never have
married her---merely that I might not expose her to
ridicule. But, I knew her temper. I knew that she
respected me;---and I knew, that, after a few
irregular
pulsations, her heart would settle down again, if
it had time, into the right place. It did. At the end
of another week, she had returned the ring to
Redhead
;
packed him off; and sent for me---nay, had come,
herself, to see me, actually, at my own store, in her
imprudence; though one, that knew
me
, had
said---beware
of that!---he is not the man to endure such things:
---he would never marry a woman, who had no
respect
for
herself
, however
she
might love
him
---however
he
might love
her
.
We met---it was on the steps of a friendly house:
---a sweet star-light above us. I held her hand. It
trembled. It may happen again, said I.
Never---was her reply.
I felt no rapture. I feigned none. In a little
time, during the visit, I had no opportunity to tell her
my heart. But I neither pawed her about, nor
slobbered
her with caresses---fool that I was---how little
I knew then of her true nature.
My affections are engaged, said she, sobbing, as
if her dear little heart would break.
Merciful beaven!---what could I think of such a
woman! Had she been winning me to a precipice---
only that she might play out the part of some heroine
of a novel, by telling me, at last, that her affections
were engaged.
My manner instantly changed. Both of us had
wept---both. But I arose, like one that had done all
his duty, regarding her as a creature sanctified to
another
,
prohibited to me, for ever.
Again we parted,
friends
the truest friends in all
the world!and tremendously disposed to the heroick,
and unearthly. She had many suitors; but, after
hovering
about her awhile, and scorching their beautiful
wings, they left her; or were scorched off;and I had
another summons. I dreaded to hear it, indeed I did
but I so loved her yet, that, had I heard it coming
up from the bottom of the ocean, I would have plunged
after it.
We met, and were very happy. My arm encircled
her beautiful waist; and, as I sat by her, she put her
wet lips to my foreheadmy blood thrilled, and I
pressed her to my heart---with no rudeness---no
fiercenessnoI loved her too tenderlyso tenderly,
William, that, for awhile, I forgot my own ugliness,
and held myself, as I touched her, to be a marvellous
man, and fitted for companionship with her
loveliness
.
Yet---
a change
followed---what was the cause, I
know not---women are so capricious---my phlegm, or
my philosophy;---my suspicion, for I
could
not feel
that undoubting, unqualified, noble confidence in her,
that I
had
once felt---it required time and trial to
restore
it---and I told her so---these
might
have been the
cause;---but after thought, more experience among
women have explained the mystery. I was not
ardent
,
rash, impetuous, impudent enough. I did not
fendle, nor lip her enough---my manner was too
reverential
.
What woman would'nt have been offended
---to be treated, at such a time, as if she were
not a
woman
. I could scarcely breathe, when her hand was
upon my forehead; and my hair thrilled---I could feel
it, to the root---when her fingers went through it: and
my arm---
that
very arm---which enwreathed her fine
waist, ached with pleasure---and yet---I believe in my
soul, that I never touched her lips---nay, I do not know
that I ever did touch them, during all my love. Zounds!
what a bitter sarcasm upon woman! How ignorant I
showed myself to be---though I was twice her age
nearly, and a thousand times more experienced:---and
how cruel, it was in me, not to understand her. I
loved
her too purely---with a passion too intellectual. I
visited her, as one enshrined, to whom incense should
be burned with our eyes shut---and our hands crossed
upon our bosom. Mine was love; but she knew it not.
It was not that
love
, of which she had read in novels,
and poetry; nor
experienced;
nor seen upon the stage.
I neither whined at her; nor fell upon my knees, in a
set speech; nor pawed her about; but I
loved
her, as
women ought to be loved, with tenderness and truth;
trembling to the heart, when I touched her forehead,
or when our arms intertwined. But that was not
love
not that
love
, which she looked for. She was like
some woman, that has never seen a madman, or a
murderer
,
except upon the stage---or, in a novel,---who,
if she should see one in real life,---would be sure to
vol. ii. O
call it
unnatural
, if he did not talk like the man in the
novel, or act like the man on the stage.
O, said Ihalf delirious with the deep
tranquillity
of my own spirit---how
very
happy I am!
I heard a faint whisper, in reply. It may happen
again, dear, said I. It
may
---and if it should
O, I know not what will become of me!
Her tears fell, like hail, upon my forehead, as I
lay upon the sofa; and she stooped over me. She
assured
me that it
could
not happen again.
Yet it did!---by heaven it did!---in less than half an
hour, a friend of mine, who had been making love like
a two and forty pounder, in the next room, on a sofa
---came to me; took my hand; and, squeezing it
affectionately---and
be hanged to him
Speak! said I---out with it, Joe.
She says that she never can
love
you, Hammond;
that she respects you; andand
O, very well, said I, quite
unconcernedly---entering
the room where she remained, as I spoke---and
addressing myself to her, as if nothing had happened
---good night, ladies!---good night, Miss!----Mary
Anne!---good night.
I left her, but she still haunted me. She loved me,
if ever woman loved man. She loved me, I am sure;
but she, herself, did not know it. She was beset by
fools; and worried to death by puppies;---and I began
to get distressed in my business, about the same time.
My dear friend Joe, my counseller in matters of love;
the most discreet, sage, and virtuous of men,---having
been grievously captivated in the same neighbourhood;
and having seen the sweet Mary Anne weeping, in
consequence of some unkindness in
his
dear one (about
a pair of pretty little slippers of her own, which she
had managed to exhibit, at an unlucky moment, upon
the mantle piece---the little devil!---while the big feet
of
his
dear one were in view) and having gone home
with her---and cried, it is probable, all along the road
with her---began to retract certain notions of
matrimony
,
which he had been repeating, for several months,
for my edificationwhile there was a prospect of
my
marrying.
Let me give you a specimen of it.
The most imprudent thing, in the world, said he---
dutifully, as we rambled along by a mud puddle,
walled in, which was called a
canal
, there---you must
not think of it.
Of what? said I.
Of getting married?
Of getting married!---getting
devils!
Of course, said he, bowing.
Should I chuck him into the canal? I had a great
mind to. Nobody would have missed him, except his
tailor, and washerwoman, at quarter day---and it
might have saved them something---in the long
run
---
at least, in shoe leather.
But what is your objection? I continued,
smothering
my passion, and looking him in the face---the
smirking rascal---Late marriages make early
orphans
;
you know. Dr. Franklin recommends early
marriages.
True---and, at the same time, he says, that a young
widow, with half a dozen children---that was in
his
time;
in the early settlement of America---was considered a
fortune.
The devil take the young widow; and all her
children
;
and Dr. Franklin; and yourself, into the bargain:
none of your ready made families for me! I tell you
what 'tis, Joe:---it's a d----d barbarous thing, for a
man to marry late. He is sure to die, leaving a family
of uneducated helpless creatures, behind him.
True---but with money to educate them---and
estate
to make them sought after, was his reply.
By whom? Scoundrels, and fortune hunters. It is
a curse to leave an estate in a family. The boys are
spoiled by it; and the girls are either married for their
money, or are always miserable, under the suspicion
that they
were
. How can they ever know,
certainly
, that
they have been married for love? For my part, I hope
to leave my wife pennyless. You need'nt laugh, Joe.
---It
is easy enough done, I admit, with such
acquaintances
as I have.
Humph; said Joe, pulling his hat over his eyes:
and put her up for sale, to the highest bidder, he
added
,
to obtain bread for herself, and her little ones.
I shuddered---my heart wheeled about, and threw
two or three somersets, before I could get my breath.
No, said I---I will strangle her first, on my death
bed. Gracious heaven! what can be done? Women
sell themselves every day---to the old and decrepid, and
hateful; and the publick look on, without any emotion--
without one pang; or one cry of detestation upon the
unnatural
crime. Why do they not brand her, who sells
herself
to an old man for his life; a few short years---as they
do her, who sells herself to a young man, for a year; a
month, or a night? O, it makes my blood boil, to look
about this fair world, and see what women have done,
and are doing, in the light of heaven, for money. It is
not marriage---it is coupling. The blessed
institution
of marriage should be sacred---inviolable. No
power on earth should have the right to break it up.
Publick policy requires that both parties should
consider
it eternal; that they may have the better reason to
be kind, and patient, and forgiving, to each other; and
to their children. The law will not permit a conditional
marriage; and society calls it infamy; and the fruit
infamous
;
nay, the law does the same. It may be
doubted
then, whether there be any legislative power,
existing
,
to destroy a marriage---for what the parties cannot
do, themselves, by a positive stipulation, no other power
shall do for them. Whence can there come a power of
divorce? There is no such power. A marriage,
lawfully
had, must be
for ever:
---on what ground shall you
proceed to grant it?---ill temper---unfruitfulness,
adultery
?
You offer a premium, and reward, for ill
temper
;
a crime; and from indulgence---you take away the
chief restraint. And yet---O, how reasonable men are,
and women too---they will permit a young woman to
sell herself; or a young man to sell himself, like a
beast, to the pleasure of another, who is old, and infirm;
sick, and nasty---without reproach, or infamy; when,
from the very nature of the contract, it is only for a
few years. Shame on them!
All very well, said Joe, musing---but I don't see
what it has to do with the subject.
True, said I, but to-morrow evening, I have to
maintain, that our legislatures have no power to grant
a divorce; and I was willing to practise a little in
advance
.
Our conversation ended, with the most vehement
protestation, on his part, against my marrying at all;
particularly,
that
woman---and, more particularly, at
that
time.
That was all very well; but, about a month
afterward
,
I saw him get out of bed, one morning, earlier,
by an hour, or two, than he ever did before; and go
about some mysterious operation; while I lay, and
watched, pretending all the while, to be asleep. It was
of a Sunday morning. Not a thought of his heart had
ever been a secret from me, till about that time. First,
he twisted his legs (
he
called them legs---and used
them, as I am a living man, for the purpose of walking
and dancing) into a pair of silk stockings; and then
stuck the ends of them---the lower ends---into a pair of
tight new morocco shoes, that made him gape as he
did it.
That was enough---I turned over, and went to sleep;
sure that he was in love again, up to his eyes. But
little did I suspect the truth. My dear friend---my
own dear,
dear
friend, was in love with my own
mistress
.
Several little pleasantries had passed between
them---a ring---which he stole from her hand, at the
gate; and which she sent for afterward; a card case---
and some other matters, so that, I was not absolutely
thunderstruck; when, having led him along the canal
again, soon after, I found his memory, or opinion,
respecting early marriages, so cruelly disordered, that
I'll be hanged if he did not take the
affirmative
, and
use my own argument in favour of them, before we
returned
.
So much for Mary Anne.
What became of her?---said I.
Gone the way of all flesh, he answered.
vol. ii. O 2
Dead!---poor heart---is it possible?
No---married
Married!
Why didn't
you
marry her?
For four reasons. I was too poor---she, in too
great a hurry--I would'nt have her---and she would'nt
have me.

Well
, I confess, Albert Hammond, said I, the
next evening, as we sat together, taking our tea on
the same sofathat you have a wonderful
knowledge
of the female heart, for one so little
experienced
,
and sososoahem!
Ugly
out with it!--yes, you are right: but some
women
don't mind ugliness of body; and, give me but an
opportunity to make a woman start, and thrill, with
hatred for me---to make her think of me, when she is
alone---I care not how; well, or ill---let me but sit by
her, when she can only hear my voice, and not see
my face, or person---let me but put my warm lips,
once, devoutly to her cheek---and, no matter---I would
not give up
my
chance, for that of a much handsomer
fellow.
Much
handsomer
fellow! said I.
You are squeamish to night, Bill.Shall I say one,
not so horribly
ugly
---will that suit you?
Yes
---I never say of two short men, that one is
shorter
than the other; but that one is
taller
than the
other:---for I would not obtrude an idea upon the
mind, which I know is unpleasant. So I would'nt say
of you, that.
O, hang your apologies---they are more
insufferable
than your sarcasms.
But have you ever loved another?
Yes---heart, and blood, and pulse?
Whom?
I won't tell you.
Pretty fair---faith.
Yes.
Well, well--was it that widow, in Virginia? said I.
No---but how came you to know any thing about
her?
I heard some strange stories about you, there.
Never mind them---tell me about
her
. What did
you hear?
That you fell in love with her, shockingly.
No, no! that's all a mistake; that
fall
was from
the gig. We were tandem; and one day, I had just
made an agreement with my fellow traveller, that, if
any thing should possess the horses, while he was
driving, he should hold on upon the reins, so long
as he had a limb upon his body; and I would never
leave the whirligig, while there was life in me. It was
a most providential agreement; for, in less than ten
minutes, the rear horse, a powerful fellow, threw up
both of his great, clumsy heels, into my facecut
through our iron dasherstove an umbrella
shattered
my knee pan; and gave me a
fall
that was the
fall
of which you speaknothing more.
Nothere was more bruising than that.
Well then, let me tell you the truth. She was a
charming woman. Her husband had been a charming
man; but had killed himself by hard drinking. I
had heard the finest character in the world of him
but nothing of that
from his own brother
And
when I saw the widow, clouded and sorrow stricken;
weeping, absolutely, as if he had just died---it went
to my heart. I cannot deny it---it did---and I
undertook
to console her. She was a religious woman;
and not to be comforted heretically. I told her that
whatever is, is not only
right
, but
best
. I then began
to follow up my doctrine with illustration; and as the
devil would have it, I stumbled upon this, He loved
you, madam, when he died:--he might have lived, till he
had changed. And you might have gone to your
grave then, of a broken heart; he was a sober and
temperate
,
exemplary man---but if he had lived---the
devil
!
thought I---my consolation has had a most
surprising
effect! It has stopped her breath!and tears! It
was a styptick only for the bleeding of her heart----
but, I looked up. She made me a profound courtesy,
and vanished. She was a lovely woman; and I was
rapidly
obtaining her best opinion!
You must have had some fun, in Virginia, said I.
Yes, I`ll give you an idea of it, he replied. I
trod upon oaken floors, waxed to a perilous but
beautiful smoothness; slept in a bed, where one
President
,
at least, of the United States, had slept before
me:---Showed, to an experienced farmer, the reason
why he grew poorer and poorer, every year, with
eighty slaves upon his plantation; because there were
less than ten able bodied men, whose labour could not
support the other seventy women and children; old
men and sick; I demonstrated to him, that it would be
really cheaper to work his lands, with a breed of New
England farmers. But let me tell you some of our
experiences.
One day, we met with a most kind hearted old
gentleman, to whom we complained bitterly of the
villanous tricks, that had been played upon us, by
persons, of whom we had enquired the road. The
good creature!--he rode three miles out of his way, to
put us into a short cut, which
he
had travelled for thirty
years; and he left us, wishing us a pleasant ride. We
brushed on.
You cannot readily form an idea of
it;
but you
may, of us, when I tell you, that, we were five hours,
part of it in a tremendous thunder storm beating four
miles, with the wind aft; for a whole hour together,
not a wheel would touch the ground; and we led our
horses, where goats would have felt their heads turn,
and their surefootedness in peril Julius Csar! what
a passion I was in, when night came on! But the
next dayon our return, by another road, while we
were talking over the trick; and I was wishing to
encounter
the old man for about ten minuteswe came,
all at once, upon him. He was ahead of ushis broad
hat, pulled over one eyehis whip, held stifly in his
hand,
racking
away(a vile, execrable
pace
, that the
finest horses in Virginia are taught) My first
disposition
was to knock him off his horse, or shoot a
bullet
through his old hathead and allbut he turned
round, so innocently, that I could not, for my heart,
have harmed one of his gray hairs. I thought, sir,
said I, that
you
had travelled that cursed road, for
thirty years
.
So I have, he replied, looking surprised.
In a
gig!
said I.
A gig!O, Lord!---O, I beg your pardon---O,
gentlemen--No---O!---Ohno---I always went a foot,
or on horseback---Oh, no---in a gig! O, Lord, no!
Poor fellow---we had been so busy; and he, so kind,
that he had overlooked our situation---he did not see
that were in a gig, with two spirited horses, tandem!
nor recollected that he had always travelled it, a foot,
or on horseback.
We went into it,
[11]
[11]
It
what?
Virginia
, I suppose
Ed
.
with a kind of carriage called a
Buggy
, horses, harness and equipage, altogether, worth
about one thousand, or twelve hundred dollars; and
we returned, with about enough of the original BUGGY,
to make a snuff box of;it had been pieced and
patched
;
mended and painted; till it looked more like
something
put together by chance, than with any
preconcerted
intention. At one dash, we carried away the
top; shattered the whipple tree; snapped one arm off;
and dislocated every joint in it. At another, (I was
driving, then,) we leaped both horses, at once, in their
harness, with the gig at their heels, out of a ferry boat,
upon a solid bed of rock. Neither of us had ever
driven tandem before; and it was the luckiest thing, in
the world, that our bodies did not arrive, at the end of
every day's travel, shattered as badly as the gig. I
went for amusement; the gentleman with me, upon
business. You have been in Virginia. You know
something of their sawney way of drawling out their
words, like molasses candy; and you know that I am
somewhat impetuous.
Somewhat!
said I. I believe you. I
used
to
think differently; but you are mightily changed since
you were a boy.
O, my whole nature has altered, since I was a
boy; the gibing and taunting, of all the world, have
turned the very heart in my bosom to gall. I feel it
dissolving at the core, and the mortal poison dripping
from it. Yet I do hope---I
do
, William Adams,
fervently
,
that I shall be able to make them tremble yet,
without being a bad man. O, had heaven been
pleased
to give me shape and beauty, like other men, what
might I not have been?
And would you give up your talent; your inward
superiority, Hammond, in exchange for beauty?
Would I! Ah! I cannot tell. Some times I think, that
I
would
---that it would be better for me, were I a fool,
in spirit, with the outward proportions of humanity---
than to be---what! a destestable thing, that men avoid
---and children cry out at---and women---O heaven---
that
is
hard to bear---that women cannot love.
Yet you have been loved.
True, true, I have been; but how! not as I should
have been, were I less powerful of spirit, and less
horrible
of body.
I doubt it; women that are worth subduing, are
not to be won by shape.
Nonsense, William; shape and beauty have power
with all things in heaven and earth. God meant that
they should have it. The very beast cowers before
them. A beautiful woman might go naked among
lions, unhurt; a naked man might pluck the young
leopard away from its mother's dugs---were he still
the lordly, imperious, undegenerate, noble creature,
that God put into paradise!
I pressed his hands. I leaned my forehead against
his face. I loved him; and I wept.
And what have I to console me? he continued---
his melancholy eyes shadowed; and his mouth
quivering
:
my intellectual superiority? How know I that
the veriest fool about me, might not have been
greater
,
had he been spit upon, and trodden upon, as I have
been!
Forgive me, Hammond; O, forgive me, said I, for
my heart smote me, and I remembered where and by
whom, he had been spit upon.
From my heart and soul, do I, said he. I knew
you then, William, even then; and blessed you for the
love that I had for---for.
For whom! said I, lifting my head.
No matter, he answered, quickly---proudly; no
matter---men will deceive themselves. The ugliest
will sometimes forget their ugliness; and when they
see beautiful eyes change colour---and a beautiful
mouth struck pale, at the sound of their voice; when
they hear another, in reply, so sweet, that this sound,
like the continual ringing of a thin silver pipe, through
which water is running swiftlyno earthiness in the
colour of the one---nothing mortal in the smooth
melody
of the other; yet fainting away at their approach--
O, men will deceive themselves! What wonder then
that I did! that I, who had locked into angel eyes, till
my own shadow seemed beautiful there; till the deep
blue
of heaven, itself, while I stood rapt and wondering
at it; warm with a light so like her own---seemed
peopled
,
like her eyes, only with brilliant and lovely
shapes. What wonder that the
blue
flower; the
diluted
sapphire; had all a sweet population, just like what
I had studied so intently in the
blue
of her eyes. O,
Jehovah! but I did forget thee! myself---the world: ---
all but her!----Look where I would, I saw nothing but
her halfshut eye lids, and wet mouth opening and
trembling
.
My books were full of hermy drawingsnay,
my very flute had caught the tone of her voice; and, for
my soul, I could not make it utter any other sound!
What wonder, William Adams, that this delusion and
death were fatal to me. What wonder, after I had
forgotten
myself and all my ambitionthat I prayed only
for some dark solitary place, where I might lie down,
far away from men; and die, with my eyes fixed upon
her! I did not pray to wed herO, I did not think of it.
I might have shuddered at the thought; or prayed for
barrennessbut oh, my friend! my friend! may you
never
feel that sorrow; that of all others, which is most
deadly, and enervating; that, of having loved tenderly,
passionately, devoutly, with the holiest and purest
feeling of all your heartwithout daring to wish for
gratification. I cannot go on---you are affected,
distressed
thank
youmen should not weep at trifles,
William; and such men as you, neverII.
I felt, as ifzounds!it was just if some one were
pouring cold water down my backat the lamentable
soundaaahem!
You were speaking of Virginia, said I, as soon as
I could articulate audibly, let us change the subject.
Yes, yes, said he, endeavouring to laughYou
remind me of a man that I saw on trial once. The
clerk read the indictment to him; and he stood mute.
Guilty or not guilty! said the clerk.
He was silent.
Speak sir, said the Chief JusticeAnswer to
the indictment. What do you say? guilty or not
guilty?
Spose we change the subject;
[12]
[12]
JOE MILLER, 1st. Ed. p. 13, and 14,
Ed
.
said the man.
You were at Harper's ferry, I continued. Is it so
very wonderful?
No---no such mighty matter, I assure you---the
war of the rivers and mountains---the scene, which
was worth crossing the Atlantick to see.
As Mr. Jefferson says
Is nothing at all. So little is there, of what you
expect, that, if you were taken up in your sleep; and set
upon the top of the highest hill there, you would think it
a very common affair, when you opened your eyes upon
it. But, stay; I can give you some notion of the
Virginia
manner.
Their hospitality; said I, eagerly.
No---that has gone out of fashion, now---I saw
none of it. I spoke of their travelling manners.
Why, I thought that they were the most princely,
and hospitable people in the world.
Nojust like all others. Among a thin and
scattered population; a stranger, of course, is caught,
and treated as a prince; but that does not deserve the
name of hospitality. It is only a cheap way of
purchasing
the news; and seeing the world, at second hand.
Thus, you will find the hospitality of all civilized people,
on the earth, exactly in proportion to the fewness of their
visiters; and the unfrequency of their meeting with
strangers
.
A courteous old gentleman from the country, the
first half hour after he arrives in the city, will go bare
Vol. II. P
headed through the street, bowing to every body that he
encounters; but, he soon learns, by the people staring
at him, that he is in a latitude, where such courtesies
are impertinent. Half a century ago, you could not
ride by a Virginia plantation, but, at the hazard of
being
made captive, by the slaves; and feasted and stuffed,
man and horse, for a week; but now, you must carry
some other recommendation, than your looks; the
appearance
of a gentleman; or the name of a stranger; to
get admittance. I have experienced this; ha!---you
are laughing at the idea of any man getting admittance
with such looks---even to the den of a wild beast.
No, said I, endeavouring to look droll. Not
exactly
that
.
The devil! Adams, I understand you---such looks,
you think, would be a certain passport
there!
I should
get in, unmolested, undisputed; Hey? should'nt I? Is
that what you mean? said he.
Well, well, Hammond, never mind---it is your fault.
You are constantly inviting such allusions; but, go on
with your story. What were you to tell me of their
travelling manners?
In the first place, let me give you a notion of
their taverns. Except in the considerable towns---
which, by the way, are very inconsiderable; they are the
most wretched things upon this continent. All the
landlords
are
gentlemen
---the prices, perfectly
genteel;
and
their fair, damned genteel; split chickens, smoked over
the coals; and fried bacon, morning, noon, and night.
The business of inn-keeping is held to be rather
disreputable
among them; and, as it is hardly yet the
fashion, for a gentleman to stop at a tavern, if he can
get his head into a cow house, or a hay rick, they
make the few that are driven there by hurricanes; or
quartered upon them, by sickness, pay for it
shamefully
.
[13]
[13]
That isthey make those who
da
come, pay for those who do
not
come.Ed.
I could tell you a thousand instances of their
extortion
,
impudence and nastiness; but one will suffice.
We had been apprised, for twenty miles beforehand,
in a hot day, of the next tavern
the major's
. Every
body talked of the major; he seemed to be a sort of
guide post; and quite a rival for the
Court House
, the
place for reckoning latitude and longitude from, in
every county of Virginia. At last, we arrivedthe
house was all open; every window in it. Upon a bench
outside, lay a sick negro; turning white, before our
eyes, with some horrible disease; in the next room, lay
the
major
, with both feet swathed, sticking out of the
window, and drying in the wind; the whole house
scented with vinegar and burnt rags. Is this the
major's
tavern? said I, reining the leader round, gallantly.
Tavern!
echoed a peaked face booby, six feet
high, at the door, thrusting his hands, both together
into the waistband of his breeches. No sir. But,
seeing that I was about to turn awaywe sometimes
take in
gentlemen.
O, that is quite enough! I cried, leaping out
that
is the form, I take it, of your Virginia licence.
I was overcome with heat, and fever; and went into
the house; and laid my head upon the table, sick at the
heart and stomach; with the smell of death, like a
reeking
hospital, all about me. They had nothing to eat,
nothing to drink; no oats, nor corn, nor grain, for the
horsesand no servant, except an old woman, to
untackle
them; so that, when I went outby heaven and
earth, there was`nt a piece of the harness, as long as
your arm, hanging togethernot a buckle, that she
had`nt unbuckled; nor a strap, that she had`nt pulled
outfor all which, the major charged only two dollars;
and left us to harness our horses for ourselves.
Faith! said Iit was like pulling the fellow by
the tooth, all round a barber's shop, and only
charging
sixpence.
Joe Millar;
he replied.
We were at Harper's ferry, too; at a celebrated
tavern, which I would recommend to all the world,
when they are so hungry, that they can eat
anything
,
at
any price
, cooked in
any way
, without vegetables.
I chose to have some lemonade; and we had just set
down to the table, when the host entered; and, ducking
vehemently, two or three times, informed us that a
gentleman wanted to dine with us, if we were
agreeable
;
as he was in a hurry.
Our compliments; said I; send him in.
We are
very agreeable
.
A few moments after, a middle aged man, dressed
in black, was shown in; and took his seat, without
further ceremony. I was rather amused with his
countenance and bearing. He sat bolt uprightand,
always dropped his knife and fork, and turned his
head about, with a brisk motion, whenever I spoke to
him. I took advantage of the propensity; and once or
twice, led him into an awkward scrape, by asking him
some question, while he had a bone in his mouth.
He would let his hands fall, as if they were struck
down with a bar of iron, and face me, with the
bone between his teeth, unable to articulate a word;
till he recollected his situation; when he would lean
over the plate, without stirring a finger, and let the
bone fall out of his mouth, into it. I kept my
countenance
,
and so did my companion; but he well nigh died
of the distress that it caused him, to hide his
laughter
.
However, I soon found that we had a
disagreeable
,
thick headed, vulgar fellow, instead of a
gentleman
,
with us; and I determined to get rid of him,
that we might he alone.
At length, he grew quite intolerableand reached
out his long arm, with a slow movement, in a direction
toward my tumbler of lemonade.
I looked at the arm, for some time, wondering
what it was after, and where it came from; and when
I saw the true object, provoked at his stupidity, I
turned
my eyes toward his, with an expression, that
arrested
him for a momenthe hesitatedhis arm was
motionless
but
still, on the way to the tumbler.
I'll take some o' that are; said he.
No you wont;
said I, in the same tone.
He stared at me, for a momentdropped his hand;
and drew himself up, much as if I had been guilty of
some violent outrage upon decorum; and my friend,
colouring to the eyes, immediately gave him his own
glass; into which, the brute stuck his tobacco stained
lips, at once, without the slightest ado, as if it had been
the table beer, provided for every guest. In such a
ease. I would, with pleasure, have ordered him a glass
of his own; but I could not---my courtesy is not so
complying
suffer
a greasy fellow to thrust his nose into
my glass; or put his paws into my plate. Some
soldiers
passed the window, with two or three black
musicians
.
Them are niggers
, said the Virginian,
makes nice sogers
.
There was a dead silence. I had half a mind to
bring on a quarrel; but I could not. All that I could
say, would`nt stir his blood. How your eyes flash,
William. You would`nt suppose that I impute such
forbearance to all the Virginians. O, nomost of them
are, as they say of themselves, chuck full `o fight;
fellows of high blood; and damnably true with a pistol
bullet. It is their chief accomplishment; and their
only
chance of notoriety. But, let me finish. I looked
my companion in the face. Did you ever see such cold
blooded impudence? said Ithese are your Virginia
mannersDamn it, I should as soon think of saying to
a man, I'll take your tooth-brush, or your shirtas
I'll take your tumbler
. But nothing would do. The
man would not quarrel.
But that is the custom of the country, said I.
No, said he; you are mistaken. A well bred
Virginian
,
is generally, one of the best bred gentlemen to
be found. But, the lower orderand nearly all of the
Kentuckians---will take the glass out of a stranger's
hand, then squirt his tobacco spittle upon his boots, and
drink in his face.
Truebut they mean wellthey would have you
treat them, in the same way.
Yes, hang themI remember a case. A fellow
wanted to make me drink a half pint of their detestable
whiskey,
raw
, once. I remonstrated. There was a
room full. They cursed me for a gentlemanand got
round me; and swore that I should do it. I
expostulated
;
pretended sickness: told them how I loathed it
nay, took out my pistols: but, they were not to be
intimidated
and
You drank it.
No
---I tasted it.
You
did
....I would not have believed it.
vol. ii. P 2
Yes.....but the moment that I did, I dashed
the vessel into ten thousand pieces....leaped into the
corner, and swore, by the Everlasting God, that I
would put a bullet through the first man's heart, that
came near me.---The savages! One advanced---I took
deliberate aim. Fired....and saw the cloth fly from
his jacket.
By Gaud! said the fellow....gee us your hand....
Do you know
what
I am? Steam-boat!run agin me,
run agin a snag....jam up....got the best jack-knife,
prettiest sister, best wife, run faster, jump higher, and
whip any man in all Kentuck, by Gaud! I stood, stock
still, wondering what the creature meant. But, he did
not suffer me to remain long, in suspense. Come,
said he, come out, if you are a man....rough and
tumble
.
Gouging? cried one of the gang.
Look ye! said I... scoundrels, (thankful,
nevertheless
,
that I had
not
killed the fellow: for, I can bear
death, better than the upbraiding of my own heart....
anything---even to the spatter of blood in my face....hot
from the heart of a man....lips and nostrils reeking
with it.)
I shuddered...Go on....go on, said I, faintly.
He continued---Hammond, I mean---pardon the
confusion
of my narrative.
Look you, said I, I do not well understand you.
You are a large man. I am a small one---yet, you
will not find me so feeble as you suppose, if you all
set upon me together.
A pause.
What say you; are you for a quarrel?
They all nodded, and began to rub their hands.
Well, said I; choose any one of your number---
promise me that you will not interfere, any of you,
and there is my pistol.---Saying this, I discharged it;
and the ball rattled against the chimney, and came
back to my feet.
One of them took it up. Hell fire, Nat---it was
loaded---it's hot now, and blackened with powder,
said he.
Loaded
, said the fellow---that I had shotyes,
that it wasrunning his hand into his bosom, and
pulling it out, all bloody---see there!---
loaded
---yes---
and we must ha' it out.
I looked at him, for a moment. Then you, and I
are to take the tossle?
Yes, yesready!---ready! all ready.
There was a general outery at thisand all present
set up a shout; and flourished their hands and feet.
Nonot yetwait a moment. I heardyou speak
of gougingare we to gouge?
Aye, gouge! and bite!pull hair! and scratch!
they yelled all together.
And
strangle
too? I suppose, said I, as
unconcernedly
,
as I could;---for I thought, if any thing would
intimidate
them, it would be such self confidence, and
coolness, in a creature, so diminutive as I.
As I said this, I tore off my neckcloth, with a jerk:
the collar, and bosom of my shirt followed.My
breastyou have never seen it---it is frightful; all
covered
with a coarse, black, shaggy hairand the
muscles
,
in their agitation among it, look like a living net
work; like exasperated, trodden serpents; rattle
snakes coiling, and writhing.I had seen more than
one stout heart quake, when I stood naked, from my
waist up, before him; and even this fellow drew back,
for a moment, when I strippedas from the clutches
of a bear.
Come on, said Istretching out my arms.
He shut his eyes, and leaped at me. I sprang aside;
and he struck the wall, so that it stunned him. He
fell; and I waited for his first stirring, to level him
again. I could do it, William Adamsthat man
never
lived, I do believe, whom I could not bring down,
like a dead manwith a fair blow of my naked fist---
nayI have felled a horse with it. He arose, and I
gave him twoone at the
mark
(the pit of the
stomach
,
you know,) and one that made his nostrils gush
out like crushed blood vessels. He staggered against the
wall; and stood there, heaving, and retching, for a
minute
;
with the whiskey, and blood running together, out
of his mouth:but, the next moment, by heaven! I would
not have believed, that mortal man had such strength;
I was under him, helpless as a babe, stunned; and as I
thought, suffocating; when, suddenly, I felt his great,
strong hand, wreathed into my hair; and the thumb
approaching the socket of my right eye; and digging
about my temple. I remembered, what I had heard;
that was
gouging
. The thought was madness; death.
God gave me sudden strength. I grappled at his
throat, just as you saw me the other day; and I never
let it go, though several struck at me, and pulled at
my arms---(they were black and blue the next day)
till his swollen tongue lolled out of his mouth---and
the breath rattled in his throat. He rolled from me,
blind, and senseless; deathstruck; and the savages
danced round me. I had conquered their champion;
and they were ready to worship me.
This was in Kentucky, said I---I have heard of
such things.
Yes---the fashion is gone by, in Virginia.
You are distressed?
Yes.
Disturbed?
No.
You have great command of countenance?
Yes.Wonderful.
But not of your
hands
, said I, glancing at them;
for, while his face was immoveable as death
vibrating
a little, only in the surface, like some
coagulated
fluid; or like molten ironhis fingers, and
hands, and feet, were all convulsed---and shaking.
Right, said he, (holding up his hands)right! at
this moment; they feel as if they were wrestling yet,
with the fellow! I have no command over them, at
timesiron cannot deaden themblades cannot sever
them, when they are sprung; and though my arm were
broken to dust; and they severed at the wrist, I do
believe, that they would fulfil their office; and cling to
the throat that they had griped; instinct with vengeance,
and wrath, like living things. Their hold was never
yet broken(and I have had their bones broken) after
they were once sprungbut it was too late then, too
latetheir prey was throttled; and no mortal help
could release it!
But I thought you patientvery patient.
I am, under insult, reproach, derision; but not where
wild beasts are upon me; or woman hath need of me.
Woman! said I, what woman was in that affair
at the prison? that, at the court house? that, on the
The
duel!
you mean.
He grew calm, all at once. Let me tell you, said
he, how that was.
Not now.
Yes
now;
now or never.
Well then,
never!
said I, unwilling to see him go
mad before my face.
William Adams, I can read your heart; you have
nothing to fear. You know nothing of my self
command
.
I can sit and talk to you, calmly, with my
heart on fire; with serpents breeding in my brain. Take
hold of my wrist---put your hand upon my pulse---
look me in the face; (I obeyed him)---now, hear me---
but beware how the joint springs; I have no command
over them; and you were in less danger, to be caught
by the hand of a strong man drowning; or under
amputation
,
than by mine, when I tell the story.
I had been challenged more than once; but I had
generally laughed it off; and I never found any body
fonder of fighting than myself, when the truth was
known; but this man, he whom I shot---softly---softly
---let me begin with the first affair.
First then, stay, there is one pleasant affair, that
occurred
to me in Virginia, which I
must
tell you. We
had risen at day light---nay, sometime before,
meaning
to make a great day s work--but took a wrong road;
and discovered it, just when we were, man and horse
fainting with fatigue and hunger. After much toil,
we came to a house, lined all about with the devilish
things, called embroidery and painting, done by creatures
that have been brought up at a boarding school; this, of
course, did not much help my appetite, or temper; and,
after getting the whole house about my ears there; we set
off again, and arrived---O! with my blood all on
fire---at
a
tavern
, kept by another
gentleman
. I could
neither
eat nor speak; the fever and ague were upon me;
and all that I wanted upon this earth, was a bed to die
upon. Do you think the infernal rascals did not put me
into a garret; the wall six feet thick, at the least inch;
and whitewashed inside and out, as if they meant to
bake me alive; two windows only in it, exactly east
and west, so that the sun was in it all day long, (if not
all night) with a bed hot enough to roast, any thing
but bed bugs, and they were gasping for breath.
And when I had got fairly into adose? no, into a
rare done
state; do you think the sons of bitches didn't
send up a negro wench to wake me, with a plate full
of green pears! pears that you could not bore into, with
a gimlet! It is true, by heaven.
But, let us have the duel, said I, laughing; or
that, which you say led to it.
Well then, to begin at the beginning.
First, there was a scoundrel here, who pulled out a
pistol, and snapped it in my face. I beat him for it;
and he insisted on satisfaction; and, when I met him, I
had no idea of fighting. I meant to get an apology if I
could, if not, to make one. He had'nt the strength to
level the pistol.
But the affair of the court house, said I.
O, there was another scoundrel, he replied,
arraigned
in court for counterfeiting---I was all on fire to join
in the prosecution; but my better feeling prevented me.
I knew that I hated the wretch so bitterly, that, if I
opened my mouth against him, the jurors would
probably
acquit him, from a mere principle of humanity.
When the trial was through, the Judge called him up
to reprimand him for having suborned a witness, a
fact that nobody could doubt, who heard the trial.
I have been injured, said the rascal,
misrepresented
,
your honour.I am an honest man, your honour,
an honourable man
a man of family
.
(A blunder that he always madehe did not, and
could not, understand the difference between a man
with
a family, and a man
of
family.)
There are fifty men in court, that know mecall
any of them, your honourany, I do'nt care whom.
The Judge was standing upon the stepthe
scoundrel
below him; and I, just at his back, unseen,
unheard
;
but my patience could hold out no longer. I
knew that he was one of the most wretched swindlers
that ever lived; and I tapped him gently on the
shoulder
call
on
me!
I am readycall on me, I know
you, said I. He looked round, and turned pale as
death, when he saw me; but willing to brave it out;
that is the man, said he, Albert Hammond; he is the
man that has gone about telling.
I was afraid that he might say some word, which
would make it necessary for me to knock him down,
upon the spot. And, lest he should, I just put my face
close to his. I could not speak; but my lips moved,
and he saw my eyes.
He stopped short, gasping for wind, as if he were
ready
to give up the ghost; and, the next moment was
dragged out of court, by his own counsel.
There was a silence then, for some minutes, as if a
murder had been committed. The judge took his seat,
utterly amazed and confounded.
What is the matter, said one of the bar, to me, in
a whisper, across the trial table.
Nothing! said I
nothing
and then I proclaimed
in a loud firm voice, that William R. Smiley, (that
was the man's name) was the most damnable scoundrel
that walked this earth!
I then turned, leisurely round; and walked out of
court: expecting every moment, in the awful stillness
that followed, to hear the judge say---Officer! take
that man into custody. But he forbore---God
bless him for it! he forbore; and, as soon I had leisure
to think of the outrage that I had offered to the temple
of justice; and to a respectable magistrate, I sat down,
under the remonstrance of a friend, and wrote a letter
of apology, to him.
How was it received?
Well, I dare say---I heard nothing of the affair
afterward
;
except that Smiley had publickly threatened
to whip me; and I was warned to take care of knives
and pistols.
Were you not afraid?
No, not in the least. When men mean to do such
things, they do not threaten; and I knew that he dared
no more face me, nay, with Peter Raymond, Charles
Gordon, and Samuel Saubiere, and half a dozen other
just such cowardly, sneaking rascals at his back, than
he would a starved lion. I had been often threatened;
and never without feeling much more secure than
they
,
when I looked at them and said nothing. Once, there
was a great six foot fellow came to my office, late in the
evening, with the avowed intention to flog me. (I did
not know of it, till afterward.) That he might be the
better able to do it he had filled himself, up to the eyes,
with whiskey; in which state he was, as I afterward
found, one of the most brutal, blood thirsty fellows, that
ever lived. He had maltreated his wifeabused her;
beaten her; the mother of many children; and,
literally
,
kicked her out of his doors, and I had undertaken
to make him furnish her with a support. Once, and
with great difficulty, I had reconciled them; but this
was the second time.
As soon as I opened the door, I saw in his eyes,
what would have made almost any man tremblethe
purpose of a murderer. Yet, I pointed him, calmly,
to a chair; sat down to my writing; and pretended to
wait for him to speak.
He had come on an errand of death; but he dared
not break the silence; he dared not open his lips. If
I could keep this awe upon him; I knew that he would
have no opportunity to work himself into a passion.
Three or four times, he looked up, as if about to throw
himself upon me, at once; but, my apparent unconcern,
and perhaps helplessness; or sense of security
disconcerted
,
and, probably, intimidated him. It was not
what he had expected; and had
prepared himself for
. He
had all the business of
screwing
up his courage, to do
over again; and so, like every man in such a case, was
disconcerted and frightened. I arose, at last; opened the
door, and pointed him out. He obeyed me; by heaven he
did! and it was not till I heard his step upon the
pavement
stoppingand
I had bolted the door, that I
was fully sensible of the escape, that I had made.
The sweat started from my forehead, when I came to
think of it. I was all alone; with no living
creature
;
and no arms near me, thenbut it was the last
night that I was unarmedthe very next day, I was
prepared for him, or anybody. He never knew how
he got out of my office, and never will; and, I am
sure, from his stopping, and coming nearly back, to
the door, again, which he found shut against him, that
he had not entirely given up his purpose, till he saw
that he could not perform it. The next day, his wife
came to see me, half frightened out of her wits; but,
when she saw me, and heard me speak; and found that
I was not only a living, but a well man, she could
hardly believe her senses. I was the first, probably,
that ever escaped him, when he was drunk, and in
wrath,
How like me! I exclaimedupon my word,
Hammond, you are infinitely less of a hero, than I
thought you!
Thank you, said he, smilingyou are very
candid; I do not pretend to be a hero. I hope never
to be one. But, I do believe, that the time will come,
when I can bear to be buffetted, and spit upon,
patiently
.
Nay, I could bear it nowI am sure
If all mankind could look into my heart, and see
the true motive of my forbearance---if they could see
that it was not
fear
, but courage; not meanness; the
spirit of a dastard, but magnanimity.
You knew a young man of our neighbourhood,
named Lewis?
Yes.
I have been nearer having a case of life and death
with him,
deliberately
, than with any other human
being---I thought of it for several days. He had
taken
advantage of a weak and sickly young fellow,
whom I had known; and beaten him shamefully, once,
with a cowhide.---A friend told me of it. I made up
my mind, upon the spot---to beat him, blind, at any
rate; and, if he should be peevish, or troublesome, to
beat him to death. I went to his house, while the
vol. ii. Q
thought was upon me; but heaven prevented me--I was
a stranger; and, by accident, he happened not to return
till later than usual that night, not, indeed, until I, as a
stranger, had left the house. Before we met, my
disposition
nearly changed; and he escaped. Yes! Adams;
there, I was like
you
. Had I met that fellow, I should
have slain him, I have no doubt; for he was strong,
perhaps as strong as I; and I should not have endured
any
resistance.When I think of that, I tremble. It
was too black, and deliberate, for any man in his
right senses to undertake---may heaven pardon me
for it! It was a deep and dreadful meditation. Many
a poor fellow has been hung for less guilt.
Had you not some unpleasant affair once, about a
murderer?
A murderer!noO, I remember!yes, yes. No,
it was'nt any matter of seriousness. A man had been
taken up on suspicion of murder; and the people, about
him, were putting questions to him, on all sides. I
went to the miserable creature, and told him not to
answer
themto answer nobody; or nobody but the
judges, who were about to examine him.
Am I
obliged
to answer
them?
said he, piteously.
NoI replied.
A man who saw me in conversation, with the
prisoner
,
and was afraid to speak to me, himself, spoke to
another; and he, to another; till, at last, it came to the
ears of the judge.
He
spoke to mecalled me up before himput on
all his terrours(how little he knew me!)there was a
dead silence.
You have been talking with the prisoner? said he,
sternly.
I
have
, said I, rivetting my eyes upon his, to show
him what he was about to encounter.
Andandand what did you say to him? he
continued
more complaisantly.
I repeated it:adding: I did my duty, sirno
more nor less; and I know what
my
duty is(and his
too, I might have added, as well as he didand better
than he
did
it.)
O, sir, he replied, graciously, you were
perfectly
right
perfectly!
Yes, sir.So I was
. I knew it as well as he did;
and, while I was yet smarting under a sense of the
meditated
indignity, that had been offered meone of the
officers of the court, put his hand upon me, and pushed
me.
I glanced at himhis hand fell, as if it had been
struck with a bullet.
Stand back, said hefiercely, stand back!
Not an inch, said Iand hark yedon't put your
hand upon me, againif you do
Why! said he, what would you do?
Do!I answered, breathing in his facepitch
your carcase down that stair casethat's what I'll do!
try me.
I'm an officer of the court, said he, shrinking
back, somewhat appalled.
`The court!lay your hand on me again; and I'll
pitch you to hell; and the court after you.
He smiledand I believe, began to feel his courage
coming back; but he did not know me. I touched him,
and pointed to the yard below.
No, said heI cannot leave the court.
I could not wait all day, for an opportunity to whip
him; and I came off; but two or three days after, I
encountered
him in the street. I went up to him directly;
but, the moment that he saw me, he turned pale; shook,
from head to foot, and made me, just the apology that
I desired. I knew not what I should have done with
him, else
Were you able to beat him?
Beat him!yes, to death, before he could utter a
crybut I would, rather have been beaten to death
myself.
Is it possible?
Possible! he exclaimed; you do not know meI
am all over boneI can plunge my arm, up to the
elbow, into the side of any man that ever breathed.
I
But the duelHammondI am weary of holding
your pulse.
I am coming to it, he added, haughtily. Let go
my wrist, then; I cannot do it at once. I have kept it
off as long as possible. It cost me some preparation;
and as I never yet told it to a human being; and it is
only known, lately, to the relations of the poor fellow
(his voice falteredand he turned away his head)
IIlet me begin with the first affairI was
shockingly
insulted; but I bore ittill I was no longer
master
of myself. We fired across a table; and I found
then that neither of our pistols were loaded:the
powder
singed my facewe were so near.
That
was the
first. I was young then; but the story got wind, and I
was
put upon
, the more for it. At last, after two or
three trifling matters, I had one, that had well nigh
been serious. I was in a little country town. A
beautiful
girl, who had once been very dear to me, sat
working
by my side. A noble hearted fellow stood near
me; and, after some pleasantries, wrote upon a piece of
paper, with a lead pencil: I promise to pay A. L.
(the girl in question,) one kiss, value received. She
took it, and laughedsaying, what shall I do with
it?
O, it's negotiable, said Iendorse it over.
Endorse it! how?she asked, eagerly, her blue
eyes winking with pleasure.
Give it to me, said I---and I wrote upon the back,
pay to
Sally
(somebody)---about whom the poor
fellow
was especially sore, though I knew it not---I had
only heard her
name
---Sally
was a black girl
.
His dark eyes flashed fire:his lips turned to the
colour of white ashes, and trembled. Do you know,
said he, that
that
is an insult?
I did not, said I---turning immediately to the
girl, and begging her not to imagine any such thing.
He was still in wrath,---but turned haughtily, and
said, very well, sir, and left the room.
As soon as he had gone, the lady of the house told
me
why
he had been hurt. I was very sorry, for he
had generous blood in him; and I would not, for my
right hand, have wounded such a nature. But what
could I do? I had said all, that a gentleman could say:
---true, but not all that a
man
could say. So, I
followed
him to his room; told him the whole; and gave him
my hand. His eyes filled. He shook through all his
frame---we were friends from that moment.
Of course! said I, of course!
The next day, he carried my answer to a
note
, from
another quarter!
How was that?
Why,---I was hard pushed in company, one
evening
,
and proposed, merely for talk's sake, that we should
ship off a load of New England girls, with pattern
cards, for the southern market.
I had previously been pretty free with the
southern
character, freer, it may be, than I should have
been, had I not supposed that all in the room were from
the northern and middle states. But a young man,
whom I had all along supposed to be a Bostonian,
at
least
, asked me, with something like a sneer---for what
purpose
I should ship women to the south? I did not
like his manner, and answered with more bitterness
than I intended
To
marry gentlemen
---if they could be found.
Soon after, the company separated; and, after I
returned
to my lodgings, I heard, to my astonishment,
that the young man, to whom I had addressed the
remark
,
was from the south.
Then, said I, if he have blood in him, I shall
get a note during the day, to-morrow. I said this,
because
I knew the Virginia character, prompt for
quarrel
or reconciliation; frolick or deathlion-hearted
fellows---with bosoms like a powder magazine---and
excellent targets.
I was not disappointed. The note came, with all
due ceremony, asking two or three civil questions,
which I, as civilly, replied to---maintaining, however,
stoutly, all that I had said of the southerners;---but
honestly confessing, that I had no especial allusion to
him
, in my remark; for the true reason, that I took him for
a yankee. Not that, had I known him; and he had said
what he did say, I might not have been quite as bitter;
butI should have been more careful, of course, how
vol. ii. Q 2
I sported with the feeling of a stranger, among a
people
,
who were naturally jealous of southern strangers,
and, by whom, they were held in a sort of thraldom;
like proscription and antipathy. What I said, was
perfectly satisfactory
. He was glad enough to receive
it, I dare say; and I cannot deny, that I was very glad
that he
did
receive it. I was kept in suspense,
however
,
for about an hour, by the gentleman that bore my
answer: the very man who was about cutting my throat
the day before;but, in that time, I had made up my
mind exactly how to behaveto
receive
the challenge
accept itfight him with
broad sword
, and
Ah! said Iare you a good blade?
Very, was the replyare you?
Broad sword, tolerablecut and thrust tolerable
small sword, very good.
Well, how did it end?
Oh, just as I tell youwithout blood-shed; but
hardly
was I well out of that, when I came near cutting
another fellow into mince-meator of being cut into
mince-meat, by him.
There was to be a ball at the house where I was; and
a young Hotspur from the south, a dwarf too, not taller
than I, but prettily put together; and much younger,
had promised, if timely notice were given him, to run
away from college, or feign sickness, for a day or two,
and take a hand in it.
I had been employed, all the forenoon, in writing
notes of invitation; and, at the last, wrote one to him.
He has read your booksaid one of the girlswas
delighted with it;and so, I would have you treat him
as an old acquaintance. I yielded, and wrote him a
pleasant, familiar sort of a note, just such an one, I
know, as would have brought me from the furthest
end of the earth;then there was a little dispute about
how his name was to be spelt; and, therefore, I wrote
it half a dozen different ways, punning with it, at every
step. To add to all thiswhen I bid her look into the
almanack, and see what day of the month, the next
Thursday was(the day fixed for the ball) so that
there would be no mistakeshe looked in, at the wrong
month; and, when I said Thursday, the fifteenth,
instead
of appearing, what I meant it should be, a
particular
invitation, it looked confoundedly like a
hoax;
for,
he would find that
Thursday
was the seventeenth.
And, finally, before it went out of my hands, some boy
in the family, wrote under my name,
author of so,
and so
.
The stage coach came in, on the appointed day; but,
instead of the gentleman, it brought me an impertinent
letter, which, alter asking how old, and how large the
writer was, I crushed with my hand, and threw into
the fire; saying, as I did so, that, if I met the boy, I
should box his ears for it;that I should pass through
the town where he was, on a certain day,but should
not go out of my way, to meet him.
In five minutes, I had forgotten the affair. The
letter was a childish thing; but saucy and affected;
and so ill a return for my politeness, that, I really
pitied the fellow. On the day appointed, I arrived at the
regular hour in the town where he lived; waited some
time, and was rather in the hope of escaping, without a
scuffle; for which purpose, I had actually thrown
myself
upon the bed, to wait for the next steam boat. But
growing tired of the suspense; and, half ashamed of my
own timidity, I went below. There, I found a black fellow
waiting for me, with a note. I read it. It was rather
insulting, but boyishand, by such a messenger,
of course, I was not bound to take any notice of it
according
to the laws of
honour!
Where is this man to be found? said I.
I will show you, was the reply.
Is he alone?
No, sirMr.  is with him.
Go on. said I, putting my cane under my arm,
lead me to the place.
The etiquette of duelling, you know, I suppose, left
me several chances of escape. In the first place, the
note was brought, as I have said, by a black fellow;of
course, I was not bound to answer it;in the next place,
I was alone; and had no
friend
in the city to call upon;
and, thirdly, my antagonist was a boy in age, and
strength, compared with myself. But, on the road, I
made up my mind to act with great patience, and
deliberation
;
and then, if I could get any decent excuse for
it, to beat the principal and second black and blue, till
they challenged
me
, when I should have the choice of
weapons, and could hack them both at my leisure, with
a broad sword; or run them through, with a small
sword.
The black fellow led the way, through a long, dark,
narrow street; and then, into a house; up a dim stair
case; at the top of which, a door stood open, with lights
burning upon the table; several glasses partly filled;
and cigars yet smoking, as if a number of people (whose
voices I heard in the room above) had just left the
table, as I came in.
I had scarcely passed through this room, and asked
for the writer of the note, when a tall, handsome
looking
young man appeared, saying that he was the
friend
of the party; and that, any communication which I
might have to make, was to be made to him.
I was very serious. I threw off my surtout, and
laid my cane upon the table, looking at the door, at the
same time, the better to prepare myself for what I was
determined on; to give both of the young gentlemen a
handsome beating, at the peril of my life, though they
were backed by the whole college; and, that I could have
done it, I have no doubt---
doubt!
No---I could have
whipped the whole college, one after the other, I dare
say.
The
second
appeared a good deal struck at my
appearance
.
He had expected to see a much younger
man, I am sure; and a countenance, probably, much
less determined.
We had some conversation about the last note.
Your friend is a boy, said Iwhat excuse can I
offer to society, for cutting the throat of a boy?
O, if that be all, said he, composedly, I am ready
to step into his shoes!
I smiled; and who would not, at such youthful
gallantry
.
It made my heart feel warm, and beat high,
to look upon him. I had determined to provoke him;
but I could nothe behaved with such perfect
propriety
.
We then began to examine the matter; and
found that the whole had been a misapprehension;and
the result was, that the principal was called in, a
fine, spirited looking young fellow;and we shook
hands together; drank a glass of wine; and parted, the
best friends in the world!
Infinitely better than fighting! said I.
Butsaid heWilliamII
I looked up. His countenance fell; and his nether
lip worked; and red streaks of passion shot over his
frightfully bald forehead.

We
have come now, said Hammond, leaning
sternly on his hands; and looking. O, heaven and
earth! as if there could be no forgiveness, for what he
was about to relate. His temples were swollenhe
was black in the faceand his features were like those
of a dead manimmoveablewhile the bones of his
hand kept rattling, with an incessant motion, upon the
tablewe have come now, to the duel.
They had all toasted their women, said
Hammond
,
abruptly, locking his hands, with a convulsive
effort:
all!
and then, he
he
he uttered the name of
Elizabeth.
The name thrilled through and through me, said
Hammond. They all drank it, standing.
Elizabeth
!
Elizabeth!
echoed through the whole room. I
covered my ears, with a feeling of profanation. But
that was nothingnothing! Elizabeth who? cried one
aye, cried anotherlet us have it.
Elizabeth Adams
answered the madman, in a
loud voice, throwing off another bumper, which was
followed by the whole company. Your blood boils. I
see, William Adams, to hear me
tell
it; judge then
what I felt, to hear her blessed name uttered by such a
man, in such a company; associated with the lewd and
blaspheming. I stood thunderstruck, for a moment;
and then tried, two or three times, to get my breath; to
gasp; to cry out; to speak to him; but, I could not.
I could not see plainly; I could not utter a sound. The
company began to take notice of it; and all the noise,
and laugh, and song, and riot instantly died away, into
a stillness, more awful than death; while every eye was
turned upon me.
I was leaning toward himand I whispered, very
faintly, so faintly, that I did not hear my own voice
but, it came from the deepest place of all my heart
and he understood the motion of my lips
he
heard
me!
Elizabeth Adams, of D? said I.
Yes!
he haughtily replied: Elizabeth Ad.
You are a scoundrel! said I, jumping upI would
not let him finish itdwelling on every syllable; you
are a scoundrel, and a villain! A glass decanter
whizzed by my head, as I spoke; and narrowly missed
dashing my brains out. We both rushed at each other;
and he grasped a carving knife; but it was wrenched
from him; and we were separated, till the room was
cleared; a circle formed; and swords put into our hands
but mine was a miserable cut and thrust; and, in
receiving
one of his blows, before I could make a pass, it was
shattered to the hilt. We closed; and I was very
severely
cut in the hand. No other sword could be
obtained
;
and we stood, leaning against the wall;
panting
,
like spent tigerstill the company had agreed to
escort us to a wood, just out of the town; and leave us
to our fate, with pistols. Some objected to this; but
at last, the business was arranged; how, I know not;
and the next thing, that I recollect is, that, we were
together
his
friend with usthat it was just day light,
and that I had just levelled and fired at his heart; and
that, I saw the ball strike himbut he stood still.
You are wounded; said his second, approaching
me.
No, said I, I am
not
but your friend islook
to him. When I said this, he fell. It was wonderful
how I escaped. He was a great shot. But, when we
levelled, there was a strange darkness about me, for a
moment; and I felt as if, already, a ball had passed
through mecoldness and numbness:but I caught
his eye just then, and observed that, as I dropped
my
pistol, his eye followed it, till it was just opposite his
breast. I firedbefore he had recovered himself; and
the result was, what I have told you.
Thus ended the tale of Hammond; but the tones of his
voice!
O, no language can describe them. They went
through and through me. I felt myself constrained to
give him my hand, and to press him, in silence, to my
heart. I didand I felt his flesh quiver at the touch;
and contract, as if mine had been the hand of a
spectre
.
Look here, William Adams, said he, lifting his
black matted locks; look here!it was'nt grief that
did itno, nor old age. But his hand! Three
thousand
miles were we apart. Yet, at the moment; the
very moment when he died---the very moment! these
locks turned white! I felt his hot hand there, in my
sleep. I awoke, with a scream, that startled the
household
,
broad awake. It was midnight---but not a soul
could sleep again that night. You may smile, William,
but no---you do not---you look serious. Are you
really
so? Speak to me. Can you believe me?
I do
.
It is impossible. You cannot. You believe that I
am disordered. What! that, at the moment of his death
the very moment! he should appear to me; and put
his hand upon my temples; and awake me from my
sleep. O, you cannot!unless:William, have
you
had any experience in such things?
No.
I cannot believe you. Nothing else would make
you credit me.
Then, said I, I will tell you the truth. Two
things have happened to me, during my life; two, of
which I never think, without feeling my blood run cold
yet, I cannot believe them.
What were they? Not
believe
them! Not believe
your own senses! How know you that you are talking
to me?
I'll tell you what they were. I once saw a child's
face, without any
body
to it, as plainly as I now see
yours; pressed against the outside of a glass window,
thirty feet from the ground; no
body
no support to it;
nothing but the face. Ha! what ails you, Hammond?
By my life! I have seen the same thing! but, I never
mentioned it in my life! It was in your father's house,
at the head of the high stair casewas it not?
I stopped chilled to the very heart. I laid my hand
upon his arm; but, it was too late. There was no
disputing
with him; and that strange, icy thrill went
through all our arteries, at the same moment; and our
eyes filled, and our lips trembled, with horrour and
eagernesswhat a strange feeling it is!
And again, said I. I saw a cradle,
standing
in a floorno human being near itno wind, no
jarring, to disturb itno living creature near it
begin
to rock, with a slow, regular motion, and continue,
till I stopped it, pale and breathless, with my own
hand. A woman saw it, who at the same moment,
fainted. The child was sick, and lay across her lap.
And died; said Hammond.
No, it recovered. But, had it died, we should
have regarded it as ominous.
What caused it to rock?
I know notI never could find out. I have no
doubt that the cause was a natural one;but, so help
me heaven, I would give one of my fingers at this
moment
nay,
almost my right hand, to discover
what
that cause was, to be
satisfied
about it.
Let us change the subject; it is getting dark; said
Hammond, peevishly. And I cannot well bear to
talk of such matters, when my own shadow, upon the
wall, frightens me.
I was struck with his manner. It was really solemn,
white there was an
apparent
carelessness in it.
It cannot surely be, said I, to myself, that this
man is given to such superstition; but still, his
manner
betokened it too strongly, for me to permit myself,
at that time, to investigate the truth.
On the whole, then, I added, in a cheerful tone,
how were you pleased with Virginia? Let us return
to that, if you please.
Agreedmightily. You have heard of strolling
players. There were a set at Harper's Ferry, while I
was there. The bill announced
Octavian
, and
Rais
vol. ii. R
ing the Wind
; and, in the evening, I sought out the
theatre. It was the upper part of a barn; a sort of
cock loft, with only one window to it, (a hole sawed in
the boards) and paper hanging, for scenery; but, the
dresses were from some larger theatre. I was
delighted
I
had seen Octavian as badly acted by the best of
tragedians; and, had he not, in two or three mad scenes,
when he tore his wigthrown the hair into our faces;
(but such was our nearness to him, that he could not
well avoid that)  had there been fewer fowls at roost
over me; and fewer country criticks beside me, I should
have done very well. But the farce! O, it was inimitable.
They called it
Raising the Wind
; and it really
deserved
the name. Every one recollected what he
could of his part, (without any copy in the company,
I am sure,) and put it in, without giving or taking any
cue, whenever he could.There was no plotno
dialogue, as it was playedbut a series of repetition;
whatever
took
, was sure to be repeated; and Jeremy
Diddler ate, at least, (and who would have wondered
at it, if an opportunity offered) a dozen of eggs, with
the shells onshells, and allsound or rotten, and half
a peck of bread; merely that the audience, who relished
that
joke exceedingly. might see him snatch it out of the
London booby's mouth. I laughed, till the tears ran
out of my eyes. I had never seen a piece played,
when every man appeared so
easy
in his partso free
from stage fright. This served me for a week, at least;
and, every time that I thought of it, during that week,
I would throw myself back in the buggy; give up the
reins; and roar, till my sides ached. But after that, I
had recourse to another expedient. We had mended
and patched our gig so often, at a particular place,
every morning;
and I had gone so regularly to
breakfast
,
at the tavern, opposite to the place where the
mender
lived, to wait for it, that I found it a subject of
regular
calculation, an item for every day's
expenses
mending gig
,so much. Arrive when I would,
I never could take them by surpriseI was always
expectedthe table was set---the blacksmith ready
the painterand a boy up the road, to announce my
coming. You would have laughed. We would get
it repaired, in the morning; break it again the same
day; and, returning in the evening, limp through bye
paths, till our course could be traced by the havock,
that we made among the small hickory trees, that we had
hewed down and lashed, every mile or two, to the arms of
the gig, to make it hold together, till we could have it
repaired again. Indeed, I had well nigh contracted for
my board at the tavern, by the week; notwithstanding
the bed bugs, and musquitoes, and a creature that the
landlord called a
bar
, which I found to be a
bear
.
Pray, said I, speaking of theatricalsIt
appears
to me, that I once heard a story about you. I
do not rightly remember what, butwere you not once
upon some stage?or.
Yesfor a single night.
And how did you succeed?
Wonderfully. The people laughed themselves
blind.
Tragedy
, I suppose, said I.
Certainly, he replied. I never pretended to
make people laugh, with any thing else. O, I was
very
finevery!
But what put it into your head?
I'll tell you. I lived for a time, once, in a small
town, where an awkward little lawyer, who had a
strange notion that he was of a tragedy turn, because
he had been permitted to blunder through the part of
young Norval, at a country exhibition;proposed to
get up a
corpse
of amateurs. The thing was
pleasantly
arranged. We took a large dancing hall;
chalked off the pit, boxes, stage, and orchestra; sent to
Boston, for some of their tattered scenery;chose
Douglas
; and, as an especial compliment to
me
, who
had never seen a play performed in all my life, at that
time, gave me
Glenalvon
. You will smile at my
conception of it. I had never seen a play; but I did
not like to own it, particularly, as I had been very loud
and positive, for a long time, in canvassing the merits
of sundry distinguished actors, of whom, I had heard,
through the publick papersand I had no idea at all
of a soliloquy. I should have made a beautiful Hotspur;
and, perhaps might, in time, have barked through the
character of Richard, or Caliban, without the trouble
of dressing for the parts. Never shall I forget our
first
recitation. Burning hell! said I,
this
were
thy centre, if I thought she loved him!whereat, I took
a sort of straddling leap, and such an attitude! O, it
would have done your heart good, to see me. You
would have thought that I had just been thrown
overboard
in my sleep. But that was pronounced
very
fine! very
only, as the exhibition was not intended
for the whole town,
gratis
, it was delicately hinted to
me that a little less powdera very littlewould be
quite as natural. But, in the soliloquy, where I had to
say By and by, I'll woo her, as the lion woos
his
bride. O, I was irresistible! Not a creature could
keep his countenance. But alas, alas! the envy and
uncharitableness, of men! I was utterly supplanted
by a man, who had a knack of snapping his eyes, and
making faces, like George Frederick Cooke;and,
after
some shuffling; dragging; and one rehearsal, where
three different Glenalvons stumbled through the part,
with the book in their handsthe affair fell through.
But, I was not satisfied; and, not long after, I
waited
upon the manager of a regular theatre, and offered
my services for one night. They set me to ambling,
before them, as if to try my paces; and, at last, gave
me, would you believe it! the character of Zanga.
Never shall I forget my reception. At first, the
audience
were mute, as if death struck. It is no
exaggeration---I
say it, seriously. I never saw any thing like
it, for breathlessness and awe. But it lasted only for a
moment.---At the first sound of my voice---what I was
told the next day, was
not
my own voice---nor any
thing like it---but a gasping, inaudible sound, like
the smothered cry of a wild beastthere was a
sort of sick shuddering through all my frame; and a
suppressed exclamation, through all the audience; and
a loud, impatient, universal breathing, made up, I
thought, of derision, pity, amazement, contempt, and
compassion. God! I thought that I should sink into
the earth. My heart was in my throat---my knees
yielded, and trembled under me---a dark confusion fell
upon me--a million of dizzy lights, and eyesglittered
and danced about, and about me; and there was a
confused
murmur coming up from below me, as if I were
upon the sea shore:--and a ringing in my ears, and a
tingling in my blooda blindness and giddinesssuch
as I believe, no other human creature, would ever have
lived through. I had heard of the
stage fright;
and sea
sickness; and death, from poisonconvulsion
drowning
of
faintness---and downright suffocationbut I
never heard of any body, who had survived all of them
together---yet I did. But, just when I was about to
give up the ghost, the murmur of compassion died
away---and I heard one distinct and audible hiss. Lord,
how it went through me! It electrified me.
They
say,
that my hair stood upright---and that (I was not
painted
)
my face grew frightfully black; and I know that I
felt my blood ripple and
hiss
---I'll swear to
that
---my
anger arose, like fire in a high wind. I forgot
my terrour, in the indignity; my own ugliness, and
the grave encouragement, that I had received at
the last rehearsal, to persevere; for that, in all
probability
,
if I did, in three or four years, I should be
sufficiently
advanced to carry messages. Yes, I forgot it
allfools!and in less than twenty minutes, the house
was all, once more, still as death. I left out a whole
scene, but they did not perceive it; and went on without
any interruptionany outcryuntil I heard the voice
of people sobbing.I turnedI lookedmy heart
heavedmy own eyes filledI could have knelt down
upon the spot, and shouted to my God. I had
prevailed! I had made them
weep
that had hissed and
hooted at me. What more could I desire. Nothing. I
left the stageeven where I stoodshaking off the dust
from my feet, in testimony against them all. Since
then, I have never set my foot upon any boards.
Yet you speak, even now, as if there had been a
passion
,
and deep feeling, in your nature, for it, said I.
You are right. There
have been
, was the reply.
The stage wants reformation. I could have
reformed
it.
vol. ii. R 2
I smiled, and laid my hand upon his arm, kindly;
but with a look of gentle upbraiding, that I wished him
to feel; yethe would not feel ithe could not.
I understand you, my friend; he answered, you
are distressed at my vanity; are you not?
I am.
Yet, what do you call vanity?
I began to define it; but, he interrupted me, with
great earnestness, and authority.
No sirthey, who charge me with vanity, had
better
hold their tongues, or speak more plainly; and
say that I have too good an opinion of myself. Then,
we should be at issue. And time, the trier of all things,
would, one day, or other, determine whose judgment
was the truesttheirs or mine. I tell you, that they
do not think well enough of me.
William Adams, he continued, rising proudly, with
his haughty lip quivering like that of some young
sovereign
,
about to lift a flood gate to his army and lay
waste a province. William Adams! I despise, more
heartily than any man that ever lived, the love of
notoriety
.
I venerate, as truly; and am as steadfast an
idolator, as ever breathed, of dominion, and power; of
genuine ambition. I love praise, but not the praise of
ordinary men; and, best of all, do I love the praise of
my own heart. I love the good opinion of good, and
wise men; but, most of all, do I love my own good
opinion
.
Their
reproach, I can bear
their
upbraiding. I
can bear; but I cannot bear the upbraiding of my own
heart; the sorrow and shamethe burning shame of
my own lacerated spirit, under its own heavy dealing.
And---look at me, sirlook at meI feel that I am in
the presence of the Deity, while I speak. I know my
follies---I know my vices, better, it may be, than they
are known by any other human being---yet, so help me
God! I never, in all my life, did one act to obtain the
approbation of a living creature, contrary to the
movement
of my own heart. I never sacrificed my
conscience
for popularity---nor my honesty for praise.
Is
that vanity?
Yes---the consummation of vanity.
Well, if it be so---then, may I live and die
consummately
vain!---may I live, and die, with integrity of
heart, proud and honest!
As proudly, and as honestly; yea, as haughtily, as
you please, Albert Hammond! That is not what I
complain of-- it is the boasting of ittelling of
it---priding
yourself, in comparison with others.
This, to me, William Adams---this, to
me!
---well,
well---let us leave the subject now---we are both
getting
warm. What say you for a walk?
And yet; he stoppedhow idly the world judge;
how foolishly! I am called vain, because I say that,
expressly
, like an honest man; which other men say, by
implication
, like dastards. Ask me my opinion of
another--
and you cannot help respecting it. Ask me
my opinion of myself, and you---(by
you
, I mean all
the world) set it at nought. If I condemn my own
work, it is thought a trick, to provoke contradiction:--
if I praise it, it is thought foolishness, and vanity, in
me; no matter how just may be the censure, or the
praise; no matter how well, or ill, it may correspond
with the opinion of other men. Now, mark the
difference
.
Suppose me a painter. I am called upon to
say
, what I think of one of my own pictures. My
honest opinion is given. I do not seek the occasion
but I will not avoid it. I say, that I think it worth the
public attentionworthy of being seen by the best
judgesfitted for fellowship with the masterpieces of
the day. I am derided for a vain simpleton. But
another man, one of your
modest
menwhen
he
is
called
upon, to express an opinion of his own workwill
evade itlie---or equivocate; declare that he is
afraid, and ashamed of itin doubt about the beauties,
and alarmed at the faults, &c. &c. Therefore he is
called a
modest
man. Yet, wait a while. That very
manthe modest manwill put his picture up in a
publick exhibition room!while Iit is probable, keep
mine at home! He,
thereby
, proves, that his opinion of
his own
work
, is as high, or
higher
, than my opinion of
mine! Yet he is the modest manI, the
vain
one.
By showing his, to the
publick
, in such company, he
proves
, what his own opinion of it iswhatever he may
say
. So, with an author; one will publish, and make two
or three volumes, out of what I would crowd into one
ornament his work with beautiful typeplates
get it
reviewed by his friends
avow himself the authorin
the very title page;read it aloud, in companytalk
about it;and can repeat a whole volume; and yet,
whimpers, and shuffles, whenever it is praised; or,
whenever he is called upon to speak of it, like an
honest
man:while I neither put my name to it, nor can,
for the soul of meread any thing that I have ever
written, aloudor remember a single page. Ah, such
is the consistency of the world. Instead of being
called
vainI ought to be called
honest;
and heany
thing but a modest manor an honest man. I speak
not of my judgment. That is another affair. They
know
, that I speak what I believe, of myselfand they
know that your
modest
man never does. What! do I
see no faultsno follies, in my own work. Believe me,
sirI see many, that no other eye can seebut then, I
can see beauties too, that others will not see; and
therefore, am I indulgent to myselfno, not indulgent:
I am not. But let us walk.
It was a beautiful dayand we strolled, an hour,
or two, so pleasantly, thatI had no heart for study,
or contemplation, when I had returned. During the
ramble, (I love to mention such thingsthey go far to
show, the character of a man) we saw a person, at a
distance, whom I knew by reputationand had heard
that a friend of Hammond, had studied with him.
What sort of a fellow is he? said I. He has the
character of a scoundrel.
He deserves it.
And yet. your friend studied with him, onceand
introduced him here. How happened it?
We were now in sightrelease me, for a moment,
said Hammond, I have business with him.
Saying this, he left me, and walked directly over to
the other; a few words passed between them. I saw
Hammond's great eyes of a deadly blackness; and the
sound of his voice, was full of deep, inward
determination
.
The other was silent, and pale as a corpse. They
did not exchange a dozen sentences.
What was your business? said Iwhen he
returned
you
appeared very much in earnest; and he is
exceedingly
disturbedsee!he has stoppedah, he is
coming this way.
Never mind him, said Hammondhe won't come
to ushe knows me, too well.
By heaven, he has dashed the tears from his eyes
that movement of his handit could he for nothing
elsewhat, on earth did you say to him?
Merelysaid Hammond, with great unconcern
never to speak to me again.
And why? said Iseeing that the man had gone
back.
Because he is a weak hearted manwith no
principle
at allwho lives by his depredation upon society.
A case has just come to my knowledge. He went to a
store keeper whom I knew; and had cautioned,
particularly
,
against
him;
and introduced one of the vilest
scoundrels that ever walked unhung, to him, as a man
of property, under some temporary embarrassment, on
account of the seizure of some vessel;a large
quantity
of goods, with some money, were thus obtained; and
immediately deposited with an auctioneer, who found,
after a time, that he had made too liberal an advance.
The other scoundrel then went to him, and proposed, out
of commiseration, to take the goods away, and return
them to the shop-keeper; offering him, at the same time,
his own notes, with
any security
any in the world,
in exchange. The auctioneer asked whom he could
give.
O! said the otheranybodyas many as you
pleasethere is Mr.  so, and sonaming
that
man.
The auctioneer knew nothing more of him, than that
he was a gentleman of the bar, and accepted the
offer.
That
man endorsed the notes;the goods were
given up, to be returned; and were immediately put
into
another auction room, and sold under the hammer!
and all parties, petitioned, as it is called, off hand,
for the benefit of the insolvent law!
Gracious heaven! said Iare such things
common
?
Ayemore yet. I heard a scuffle in the street
one Sunday; and bore it, till I could bear it no longer.
I went out, and found two blackguard looking fellows,
forcing a coloured woman, whom they had literally
stripped half nakedalong the street. A carriage stood
by; and there was a tremendous out-cry, that she was
a
free woman;
and that they were about carrying her
to Georgia. I interfered; separated the scoundrels;
silenced the moband took the whole gang before a
magistrate. This man, whom we have just left, was sent
for, to defend the principal rascal; and with him, came
the villain, whom this fellow assisted in the transaction
about the goods. Both got a little saucy; and I took
the liberty to treat them both, just as they deserved
particularly the latter, who never could look me in the
face afterward, without trembling in every joint. It
was exactly as we supposed. The negro woman
was
free. It was a damnably atrocious affair;and, before
a month had passed, I was consulted about a note, which
had been given to
that
very man yonder, conditionally;
to be his, if he prevailed! But he did not prevail. The
woman was set freeyet he passed off the note!---as I
was told.
But is it true that your friend studied with him?
Nohe did not. But I'll tell you what he
did
.
He introduced him here; used all his influence, to get him
established; and only abandoned him, when it was no
longer possible for him to hear him named, without
some disgraceful appellation. He spoke to him of an
affair
not long since, at the trial table, in court. He
protested
his innocence; prevaricated;but, absolutely,
burst into tearsand
cried
, William---cried, in the
publick
court room, with all the bar about them, while he was
talking to him, in a low voice. I would have protected
that man; shielded him, if I could, for the natural good
disposition of his heart, for he would not willingly, and
directly, wound the feeling, of any human creature.---
Beside, I had known his wife before he married her;---
a most estimable woman, and very beautiful---patient
---sorrowing---and---no matter, William; I cannot talk
of such things.
But what are his talents?
As a scholarcontemptible: As a practitioner, and
advocate, tolerable; for he is cunning and experienced.
In no other respect, is he either a learned man, or a man
of talent.
You knew him before he appeared here?
YesHe was in great practice, in my native town;
became a political man; received an appointment in the
armyand was cashiered. That was enough for me;
and when I next saw him, I treated him coolly. It was
sufficient for me, that such a judgment had been
pronounced
upon him; but, when I found a villanous
propensity
in him, to run in debt whenever he could
where-ever
he could, and for
whatever
he could, I despised him
more heartily than I can express. But, by some chance, I
read his trial. I was amazed. He was an injured
man. The court had not treated him fairly; and I feel
now that what he did, was right;and that he ought
not to have been broken. I only blame him for not
doing
it more boldly, and avowing it, like a man. You
know that our nature is, where we have wronged one,
to make any expiation, any atonement. I could not
sleep, therefore, till I had got him, by the greatest
exertion
,
into a respectable acquaintance, and practice.
NayI went further, I entered my name with him as
a student; and, during his absence, staid in his office
once, for a week or two; but I never studied with him,
or any other man. I studied in my own rooms, after
my own fashion. At last, I found it necessary to
abandon
him; and entered my name with that fiery,
impetuous
,
noble hearted fellow, of whom you have heard me
speak so often, with such enthusiasm.
And tears, almost, said Ishall you ever forget
him? think you?
Forget
him!no!when I domay heaven forget
me.
He stopped; but I continued to hear his voice long
afterward, sounding in my ears.
Thus was the character of Hammond perpetually
unfolding to me; and, always, like some vast map; or,
rather, tapestry, with a constantly encreasing beauty
and proportion. The spots, and broken lines; and
disordered
colouring, grew into rivers and mountains; and
became animate with population and intelligence.
Yet, I dwelt upon him, I cannot deny it, with a
feeling
,
rather of awe than affection. It appeared to me
that we were too nearly alike; not in talent, certainly;
but in disposition, ever to be truly intimate. We were
both too imperious; unconditional; unsocial; unyielding,
ever to be permanently united in friendship. I told
him so; but he smiled, and bade me wait with patience
thatif I would wrestle with
my
devil, he would, with
his.
Mine!said I, what is it?Ambition?
Jealousy. You have many
little
devilsbut
Jealousy
is the master among them.
I could not believe him;but, when he found that I
was in downright earnest,that I was really
astonished
at the charge, he laid his two hands upon mine,
with a strange solemnity and emphasis, like one
conjuring
up devils, out of the sea;and bade me beware
of
jealousy
. I laughed, and reminded him of Iago.
But his eyes filled; and I began to feel an
unaccountable
apprehension of myselfHark! hark! said he;
---just then
We were startled by shrieks,and, after listening
for a moment, discovered that they came from a lone
house at a distance in the woodit was a cry of
murder!
murder!
My heart stopped for a moment, and then
I ran toward the place; but Hammond had outstripped
me: burst into the house; and stood---I cannot well say
how;but, when I entered, I saw a savage looking old
man, with eyes like a wild cat, sitting in a dark corner,
his face all grown over with grisly hair.---and
watching
Hammond with such malignity, that I suspected
some evil purpose. I was right---he was gradually
getting his hand about the hilt of a shoemaker's knife,
behind him. I saw a bright, quick, sharp glitter---but
Hammond was two keen for him;---he dashed him to
the earth, and wrenched the knife from him---while he
was prostrate, frothing and bleeding at the mouth and
nostrils. We soon found out the cause of the uproar.---
The monster had been beating a family of women;
his own mother, an aged bed ridden woman; another,
that lived with him; and a young girl, all as ragged
and dirty, as disease and wretchedness could make
them. He had beaten them, in mere wantonness,
because
he had fallen, in a state of intoxication, and
broken a bottle of whiskey.
What a picture! said Hammond, wiping his eyes,
many minutes after we had left the house.That
miserable wretch is left there, to tyrannise over three
human creatures, with a disposition, deadly enough
for any crime; their lives coustantly exposed to him, I
dare say---and utterly helpless. Of what materials
---how disorderly and strange---this world is made up!
How the morals of our countrymen have degenerated!
Time was, when the noise of a single murder would
ring from one end of the United States to the other.---
But now, murder, robbery, rape are so common, that
they are forgotten, in our little city, within a week
after
they have happened. In truth, my dear friend, it
is a fearful trade, this of mine---this of exploring the
blackest recesses of the blackest hearts---walking,
bare foot, and naked, (for so it is, while you are
uncontaminated
by the moral pestilence,) among the ruin and
fire, and rottenness of passions, that have burnt out;
and hearts that have decayed under the visitation of
obscenity, vice and profligacy.
Yet, after all, society here, like society every
where else, has a latent wickedness, that will always
be given out by compression:---like heat, from the
coldest metal. The more crowded and confined it is
---the more this evil is apparent.
And the very remedies, that we invent, operate as
a reward and encouragement, to vice and beggary.
It is our own fault. We have zeal without
knowledge
.
Every day, we are speculating, with all our
resources
,
on questions of political economy, which, while
we call them discoveries---have been tried
out and
vol. ii. S
out
, among the nations of Europe; and exploded, as
pernicious and destructive. Our nature is, never to
try experiments on paper, nor with models, but to go
to the business at once, whether of revenue, finance,
or legislation. We have blundered, till our best efforts
to suppress beggary and theft, are-little else, than
established
permiums for both. Like the lying-in hospital
of Catharine, which has became so powerful and
august
a defender of
misfortune
, that it is no longer
discreditable
to a Russian girl, to have had a child before
marriageto have borne children to the state. In
that country, the natural shame of woman, is a
matter
of political profit. And so too, the pleasant invention
at Pekin, to
suppress
population, by permitting
mothers
to expose their naked, new born babes, to be
devoured by dogs. What is the consequence? Instead
of operating to retard population, says Malthus, it
encourages it, directly, by removing from the minds of
people, all apprehension about the support of their
children. Boys and girls marry, therefore, under
that permission, to destroy their offspring, if they
cannot maintain them; who, if they were
obliged
to
maintain their children, would live apart. But why
should we complain?
Our
whole system of legislation
is radically defective. We reprobate certain crimes,
and yet permit them. We condemn gambling and
drunkenness---yet raise a revenue, by licensing * * *
* * * and tippling shops. Nay---do we not raise a
revenue from the billiard tables, and the bagnio?
Yes.
How! said I---what mean you?
The same thing, in effect. In one case, we call it a
penalty;
in the other, a
license
. No real difference
exists
in the thing; and therefore, all moral distinctions
are confounded. If you say to a man, that he shall not
keep a faro table, under a penalty of one hundred
dollars
;
what is it, but to say, that he
may
keep it,
for
one
hundred dollars? And if you say, that another
may
keep
a tippling shop for ten dollars a year---what is it but
to say that, he shall
not
keep it, under a penalty of ten
dollars. In New England, they had a law, forbidding
any one to ride on a Sunday, under a penalty of five
dollars. What was this, but saying to the rich man---
you
may ride---and to the poor man,
you shall not
or, you
may
ride on a Sunday, for five dollars.
CHAPTER X.
Hammond and Elizabeth...Explanation...Quarrel...Ambition...
Heroick nature...Elizabeth's testimony...Sickness...
Reconciliation
...Atonement.
Some
weeks after the conversation related in the
last chapter, I discovered a visible change, in the
deportment
of Hammond; and I thought, now and then,
that I could perceive a growing intelligence, between
him and my sister. I watched them; and, at length,
determined
to speak to him, about it.
I sat down and brought him immediately to the
point, with feelings, that I cannot express. I fear that
they were feelings of hatred and scorn. I could not bear
to think, or imagine it possible, that he had now;
damnation
!the
tears scald my eyes, while I speak;a heart
like hers, so affectionate, so innocent, and so lofty. I
meant to speak calmlybut, I could not.
Mr. Hammond, said I, What do you mean by
your attention to Elizabeth?
He turned a little pale, I thought; but replied, very
calmly.You address me, William, in a strange way.
I am afraid that you are disposed to quarrel with me.
Are you?
I don't knowthat depends upon your answer.
William Adams, he said, in a voice, and with a
manner that appalled me. I know not, that I ever felt
so utterly contemptible. William Adams, I pity you.
By heaven! I eried, starting up, with passion and
seizing him by the colar. II. (I was choking.)
He gently released himself; and then, sat down again,
with the same immoveable composure.
I was ashamed of mpselfthe blood rushed, like a
scorching fire, over my throat. I felt itI knew it;
I knew that I looked like a petulant fool; and I would
rather have been shot through the heart.
How dare you, said Igasping with rageand
literally
unable to keep my hands quiet, though I grappled
my knees, and held them, with all my might, while
I spoke. How dare you think ofof.
Ofof.
Of what?of whom?
Of Elizabeth! said he, mildly.
Ah, of Elizabeth. How dare you pronounce her
name? How dare you call her anything, but Miss
Adams?
He looked at me, with compassionhe took my
hands within histhey trembledand my eyes were
fulland so was my heart.---I could not speakno,
not to save my soul: and, but for the shame of the thing,
I would have fallen upon his neck, and wept.
William, said he, something has disturbed you.
I have told you, before, of your
jealousy
---warned you
against it, with all the affectionate interest of a brother.
You have insulted me. You have no right to expect an
answer to your question; but, nevertheless, I will
answer
it. You ask me, why I am so attentive to your
sister? I answer, temperately, I hope---because I
reverence
her. Would I win her heart---ha!you are very
cruel, Williamyour sneering, and scoffing, and
bitterness
,
almost tempt me to say, that I
could
win it---nay,
I am not quite sure of myself, yet---
do
not provoke me!
I thought that I could bear anything, from
you;
but,
do
not drive me mad. If you do---if you once mock at me,
till I threaten to win her heart, by the God that made
me, William Adams, ugly as I am, yea! though I were
ten thousand times more ugly, I would win her heart,
or break it---yea, I
would!
What kept me silent? What held down my arms---
just as if they were pinioned with iron! I was not
three feet from his head, while he spoke; and I would
have crushed it with my foot, if I could, before he had
finished that sentence. But, I was
immoveable---helpless---and
he went on.
Mr. AdamsWilliam, said he; you do not deserve
that I should answer you: but, I will. It will be a
lesson to you. I venerate your sister. I think of her,
as of something better than woman---but, I dare not
love her. I should feel that it was impious. You look
relieved. Nay, morebright, and peerless, and
beautiful
vol ii. S 2
as she is, I do not believe, were I better fashioned;
and more highly gifted, that, I should dare to aspire to
her. Yet more; for, I would have your tossed heart
reposing once more; (his voice faltered; and his hands
gradually relaxed)I love another womanI cannot
tell you, what she is, nor whobut, I love her; yea, so
tenderly and truly, that, I never mean to approach her
again. I cannot marry. God hath set his canon
against
that;
and I fear for my strength, if we meet.
I fear for hers. I dnow that she might love me; for,
what woman would not love one, who rules over other
men, if she may rule over
him
? My resolutions have
been made, alone; undisturbed by passion, trial or
tempting. I know, that it would be wrong for a sick
man, or a monster, to marry. I shall adhere to them.
My course is a perilous one; but, it is a steep one; and
will lead me the sooner, where I pant to set my foot once;
and unlock my bosom, to the Father of all men; though it
be
but
for a moment; though the next wind blow my
ashes
from the precipice. My fate is hard, William, very
hardto do what I have done; and yet, to be doubted;
where I have toiled hardest to establish a confidence,
that nothing should shaketo have it shaken to the
dust, with the very breath of man. You know
something of my nature, Williambut, you know little
of the tender and affectionate disposition of my heart.
God hath given me a yearning after lovelinessan
insatiable
desire to make some sweet, innocent woman
happyto love, and
be
loved. Yet, he hath set his
seal of ugliness, upon mewarped, and distorted his
own image, impregnate with divinity as it is, into a
creature, so shapeless and deformed, that his own heart
rises with bitterness; and he could lie down, and curse his
Maker, if he were a bad man, for having made him
what he has. But, as it is, he can only lie down, and
weep, that he hath been made so ugly. It
is
hard to
bear, my friend. I have enough to try me, without
your unkindness; enough to turn the heart of an angel,
to a stonewhen I feel, what I might have been, were
it lawful for me to perpetuate my being; with a wife to
lean upon my bosom; and children to bless me, and
weep upon my hands---You feel it, William. I see
that you do. But, how can you feel the sorrow and
proscription; the fearful abstinence that I am doomed to
trembling all over, with sensibility; a heart, alive to
every delicate, and every beautiful emotion; obliged,
that it may not be mocked to death, with derision and
insultto conceal its tenderness and loveto case itself
in a panoply of steelfar too stern for its gentleness.
Why, my brother!---O, why was I not fashioned,
outwardly
,
like other men!---or inwardly, like a brute
beast! I might then, have been happy. But now---
O, let me not question the goodness of our Heavenly
Father
!
Now, I am fitted, in spirit for all the offices of love
and ambition---warlike by nature: full of high thought,
and heroick purpose; yet, prohibited---branded---and
bodily incapable of reining a war-horse....or,
subduing
a woman. Nay, so fashioned, that, with my
heart, I tremble, even at the approach of beauty; and,
shake at the sound of a trumpet---lest I should leave
devils behind me, if I yielded to her---or become one,
myself, if I should once snuff up the blood of men, in
battle.
I threw myself into his arms. I could bear it no
longer. I locked my hands in his; and I wept upon
them. Hammond! Hammond! I cried, forgive me!
Yes, William---my
friend! William!
....I do forgive
you: but it is hard, very hard, to be interrogated so
imperiously
,
by a young man; on a subject so tender too,
---but, I
do
forgive you. Leave me, William....you
shall hear from me, in the morning.
He drove me from him, with a gentle violence; and
it was only, when I found myself sitting by Elizabeth,
and heard her ask how Mr. Hammond was, that I
recollected
enough of what had passed, to feel all the folly
of what I had done---all the
cruelty
, I should say.
I could not answer her, but took her pretty hands
between mine, and pressed them to my lips.
She put her mouth to my forehead; and leaned her
smooth cheek there; for a moment, and, directly after,
I felt the tears trickling over my temples. I was able
to speak, then.
He is well, said I; but, as I looked up, the blood
flushed so suddenly over her whole face, that I started
upon my feet-Elizabeth!Elizabeth!speak to me!
I cried, do you love me?
Love
you
. William!
can
you ask me such a question?
I knew not what possessed methe devil, Jealousy,
againI would not share, even a sister's heart. I
believe
,
with any thing mortaland I broke out upon
her, at once.
Tell metell meDo youdododo you
love
Hammond?
She staggeredput her little white hands to her
templesturned as pale as deathand fell, without
life or motion, upon the sofa. I knelt by her sideI
wept upon her neck; and when the wind blew her soft
hair all over my face and eyes, and she turned to me,
with her lids half shut---in death, it appeared to me---
I thought that I should drop down at her feet.
Elizabeth!---Elizabeth!--- O, do speak to me.
What shall I say, brother?
The delirium was yet upon me---I knew not what
made me---but I said to her.
Tell me---assure me, on your soul, that you do
not
love Hammond?
She covered her face with her hands--and the bright
tears gushed through her fingers---and her shoulders
and bosom, nay, her very arms glowed crimson, under
the transparent muslin.
I was indignant, exasperated again. I have seen it
all. I have watched youthe villain.
That was the chord!
that
was all that she wanted! By
heaven, the fire flashed, for half a minute, from her
blue eyesand there was an intense eloquence, hot
and penetrating, upon her lips. She sprang upon her
feet--sat down---as if struggling with herself, and then,
arose---calmly, but awfully---and stood before me,
like some creature, about to sit in judgment upon me.
I covered my face before her---I could not endure the
lustre of her eyes.
Of whom, do you speak, William!---Who is hte
villain
?
Albert Hammond
! said I, passionately,
Albert
Hammond, girl! the obscene and loathsome
Hammond
the
horrible, and black heartedthe.
Albert Hammond! said she, locking her hands,
fevently; her mute lips gently, devontly stirring, for a
moment, as ifas if, in prayer and benediction.
He
a
villain!
the lion heartedglorious, glorious
Hammond
!
Loathsome and obscene!
he!into whom God,
even our own God, hath infused a treble portion of his
hottest essence!
He!
whose thought is power! whose
words are eloquence! the movement of whose mind is
brightness and dominion! whose heart is the
appointed
habitation of overpowering purity and virtue!
Horrible and black hearted!
He! who, when he was
spit upon, reviled and buffetted, like the Saviour of
men, reviled
not
again! O, Albert! Albert! how has
thy great spirit been abused!
Elizabeth! woman! sister!
dear
sister! I cried,
blinded and stunned by her enthusiasm, and plucking
at her uplifted hands; look down upon me, my sister!
you will drive me distracted!
Her voice grew fainter and fainter; until it had
died utterly away; but her hands remained yet, lifted
and locked; and her parted lips still movedbut
without
a sound, or murmur. Her whole countenance was
luminousher whole form intensely animate, like
some indignant, spiritual thing, colouring all over
with shame, and stooping with sorrow. Her bright
hair fell like a thick radiance about her; and her snow
white forehead gleamed through it, like the front of a
dead infant, with her temples of stained blue. I was
humbled to the earthI attempted to embrace herI
even put my hands upon her shoulders; but they fell
off powerless; and my lips parted with terrour as they
approached; and I was gradually sinking down to her
feet, with confusion, shame, and humiliation, when the
door opened, and Hammond, himself, entered, with a
disordered aspect, and an agitated voice.
I caught his eyefirstand then Elizabeth caught
it. A new spirit blazed from her face, as she did so;
an impatient, inward sound, like the warbling of her
very heart followedbefore, he could articulate
distinctly
.
She put out her hand to him, like a queen.
She did! and the colour flashed over her face, like the
sunsetand he took itblast him!
Come hither, Albert Hammond, said she, come
hitherAre you friends!
Yes
he replied, calmly.
What think you, that brother of mine has dared
to ask me?
I know not, said Hammond, turning very pale
nothing, I hope, that.
Nothing but this, Albert---whether I loved you.
I was thunderstruck. What! Elizabeth Adams
capable
of talking thus, to a man!
She put her hands to his lips---curse on his lips---
and she bore it---aye! and her eyes floated with
expression---tenderness
!---love!---damnation.I
dashed
away the hand that I had caught; I rushed to the
door---but her voice arrested me.
Brother William! said she, one moment!---we
are about doing somewhat, I fear, that will be fatal
to our love. Do not leave me, in that temper! We
may never meet again---
will
you go?
I dashed away the tears from my eyes, and
answered
,
yes, I will go!
go, where you shall never see me
again.
Well then, rash man, if it be so, go! I can bear it
as well as you. I have as stout a heart, stouter, I
believe---a---a
(her voice deepened.)
I burst the door open, with my foot, and staggered,
like one blinded and death struck, by some unknown
visitation, down the stair case, and out, into the
wind.
I hardly knew what happened to me afterward, for
some time; I was sick, very sick; and the thought
came over me, that I had shattered some of the
vessels
of my heart; and that I could feel them weeping,
drop by drop---all day long, and all night.
After this, there was another night of darkness--flashes
of beautiful fire went through it; and voices, like those of
children in the grass; and then, I was in that strange,
desolate old house again. And the next thing, that I
remember is, that a soft face lay near to mine, upon
the same pillow---that I thought it was Elizabeth; and
tried again and again to kiss it, but it constantly
vanished---and
the beautiful mouth kept curling at me;
and the shadowy tresses, that were all over the pillow,
while I attempted to put my hand upon them, moved
off, like glittering snakes, under a transparency. The
effect was very strange. Every thing about me
seemed
to be confined within an impenetrable fluid, as clear
as glass. In short, I was vehemently shattered in
brain and constitution; and when I recovered, so as to
recollect all that had passed; I found Elizabeth at my
side, pale with watching. I opened my eyes, and
spoke to her; and she instantly burst into tears. O,
my brother! my brother! she cried, sobbing with her
wet mouth pressed to mineO, forgive me!
Forgive you, dearwhat have I to forgive you
for?
We embraced; and I could not be easy, until I had
sent for Hammond; and begged his pardon; truly and
extremely penitent, as I was, with a humbled and
contrite
heart. My very nature had changedI
determined
to ask no more questions; nay, not even,
if I lost her for everbut to let it wear patiently, upon
meeven unto death.
I hope that you will be well enough next week,
said Hammond, as he parted from me, one evening,
to go abroad. I have an important case to try; a
great constitutional question; and I should like to
have you presentas you may never have another
opportunity
.
You are going far from us---life is
precarious---all
iron, as I have been---I am so no longer;
and, there is no knowing what
may
happen.
I was deeply affected with his manner, and watched
the movement and expression of his face, till I half
persuaded myself, that he was a doomed man.
Are you ill, Hammond? said I.
I am not well, was the reply.
Do you believe--you cannot--you are strangely
pale---what has happened to you, within these last few
days?
Within these last few days!---nothing---some
disease
,
I know not what, has taken possession of me; and I
am---yes, let me say it, for I feel itI am weary of
life.
My
conduct, it may be, said I, reproachfully.
Yes, William. I cannot deny it---your conduct
has done much, to make me sick and tired of my very
existence. When I see a man like you, so forgetful of
all the charities and decencies of life--I do not want
to hurt you, but it is now too late for concealment, to be
serviceable to either of us---when I see such a man,
utterly
forgetful of all the duties of friendship---what have
I left to wish for? We are ambitious only; we toil and
battle only---tread the precipices of war, slippery
with blood---the heights of glory, burning and
crumbling
with excessive heat, only that some loved one may
be the happier and prouder for it---some loved one,
however, that
loves
us; some friend! some wife! or
child! or father, or mother! I have no father---no
mother---no child--no wife---no
friend
.
Saying these words, he left me, before I could
prevent
him; but, all night long, I heard his voice
continually
sounding in my ear, no
friend!
no
friend! I have
no friend!

My
health grew better, and better, every day;
and I was confidently hoping in that restoration,
which would give it permanency; lay the unquiet spirit
within me; and pour enough of balsam, and warmth,
into my bruised heart; to keep out the wintry feeling,
and the distracted one, with which it had been lately
so familiar:and one evening, after I had been much
happier than usual, as I sat with my arm round my
dear Elizabeth's waist; and leaning my cheek upon
her shoulder, while she read to me; for she read with
exquisite feeling; delicacy, and judgment; and I so
loved to hear her plaintive tones, wandering through
all the chambers, of my heart, like one that holds his
breath to hear, in his old age, the song that captivated
him, in his boyhoodthe melodies that he first loved;
and first wept over--ah! I was very happy; and suddenly,
I observed a change of toneone, that I thought the
passage did not require; I was half asleep and
dreaming
but
I opened my eyes, then; and observed some
appearance of confusion in hers. I saw the cause. It
was Hammondhe was passing the window, on
horseback
;
and I do not wonder, that she trembled; for,
never
,
since the creation of the world, I do believe, was
there so unsightly a creature in the saddle. He reined
the animal with great strength; and perfect
self-command
;
and sat firmly, in the seat; buthe looked rather
like a lump, than a man.
I believe that I smiled; a little bitterly too; for
Elizabeth
shut the book hastily; and turned away her
face; and her little hand, upon which mine lay,
twitched
convulsively, for a minute, or two, under mine.
The door opened.
Vol. ii. T
Hammond, himself, entered, before we had broken
the silence; and she addressed him, with a firm, kind
manner, which I could not, though I tried hard,
bring myself to like.
Are you fond of writing? said Elizabeth.
Very, was the reply---his great shining eyes, all
alive, with the exercise; and his countenance flushed.
I never saw him look so handsome.---She gave him
her hand; but I thought that he hesitated to touch it;
and, when he did, a mortal lividness shot upward from
his lips, to his temples.
Why do you ask? said he, respectfully.
Because, she continued, looking him steadily in
the face---because I do not like to see you on
horseback
.
I thank you, he replied, rather haughtily, I
thought---but he immediately repeated, in a tone of
deep quiet, and profound thankfulness; that, I am sure,
came from the bottom of his heart.
I thank you!
---
I shall ride no more. I understand your motive. It is
a blessed one---and I have felt it---felt it, bitterly,
before
;
but I have striven to overcome it, as weak, and
paltry. My opinion is changed now; that cannot be
weak, and paltry, which all the feelings of my heart
swell against---and, that certainly, cannot be
unworthy
of my attention---which Elizabeth Adams can
find the heart to condemn.
Damn your familiarity! had half escaped me---
but I gasped---and merely looked at them,
successively---till
they understood me, coloured, and smiled. I
felt a rising bitterness
here---here!
---and there is no
knowing, what might have followed; for my new blood,
after all, was of the same temperature, as my old---it
thrilled and curdled, as readily, at the touch of
Hammond's
flesh, to my sister's, as if a rattlesnake had been
put into my own bosom---naked---but just then, the
door opened, and a clergyman, whom we well knew,
was shown in. He was a man, under whom I had once
been at school; a strong minded, ambitious man; of
singular power, in his way; and absolute, in his
influence
,
beyond all example. I had once encountered him
in a stage coach, many years after he had humbled me;
and, I never left him, till I had humbled
him
to the dust.
He had been bitterly mistaken in me; for my
pleasantries
were those of a light hearted fellow; thoughtless,
and free; rather than those of an habitual trifler. The
truth is---that I was challenged, to make him laugh, if
I could-- for he had not been known to laugh for years;
and the gentleman with me, had once stood in such
awe of him, that what he said, was listened to by him,
as the indisputable declaration of God,
himself---miraculously
communicated to man. After this challenge,
I made the attempt, and was eminently successful; for,
I kept the minister in one continual smile, for two or
three hours---and, two or three times, produced a
downright laugh. But, at last, he undertook to curry
me down, as he was accustomed to curry down, the
wisest of his own congregation. I kicked a little---and
then, he abused me. I bore it, till I could bear it no
longer. I opened upon him, then, at his own
weapons
;
and fairly beat him into his entrenchments; and
beat him after he was there. The fact was, that they
had fallen to decay. He had never considered the
other side of the question, which we disputed about:
he had learnt his particular belief, as a
trade;
as a
matter
of subsistence; and had been so long accustomed to
dictation, that it threw him off his balance, when he
found any one ready to oppose him. To him---it was
downright rebellion. But the lesson was a good one;
and, before I left him, he treated me with profound
respect.
I was glad to see him here---very glad; and
Elizabeth
too, I could perceive, was not less so. She had
long wanted to pit Hammond, against him, upon some
doctrine, on which she held to the clergyman's belief;
and reprobated Hammond's; and she manifested, I
thought, no little dexterity in bringing on the battle,
here---for, after some skirmishing with the outpost,
there was a fair held fight---somewhat after the
following
fashion, between the two.
For my part, I never meddle with metaphysicks.
They are, in a measure, incomprehensible to me, if not
prohibited, said Elizabeth, in answer to some
question
of the clergyman's, whose name was Paynim.
They are better never meddled with; said
Hammond
.
They only serve to bewilder, and perplex.
I remember, that I spent, at one time, of my life,
many
a sleepless night, upon the doctrine of Free
agency.
And, what restored you? said the clergyman----
interrupting him.
My own reasoning, was the reply. I toiled to
the precipice---and then I awoke.
I am glad to hear it, answered Mr. Paynim. It
has always been a matter of astonishment to me, that
any rational man could pretend to doubt, what he has
the evidence of his own senses to prove---his own
liberty
;
his own moral freedom. You smile:sir--
perhaps
,
I have misunderstood you. It may beI beg
your pardon, if I am wrongthat you have
not
arrived
to the conclusion, which I hoped.
I believe, that I have not, sir; was the calm
reply
of Hammond.
Can it be possible, sir? You surely have never
thought much upon the matter---but then, people have
believed, or
affected
to believe, in stranger things.---
Surely you cannot have thought much upon it.
Sir! said Hammond; turning slowly, toward
him; and raising his hand in that impressive, cold,
solemn way; as if every word that he uttered, were set
down at the moment, by a recording angelSir! I
have
thought of it. Night and day, have I thought of
it, for whole years. A friend, a dear friend roused the
lion in my heart---five years ago---and he has not
slept since. And I have never been happy since. It
was injudicious in him; but the spirit that one man
may disturb, legions may not quell.
And pray, sir---Mr. Hammond, I believe, (
Hammand
bowed)---a you came then, to a conclusion---
pray, what was that conclusion?
Are you determined to hear it?
Certainly not, if you are seriously disposed
against telling itor ashamed of itor afraid----
or
Sir, said Hammondhis dark eyes filling, all at
once, with starlight, and beauty. I am neither
afraid
, nor
ashamed
, of any thing. My opinion, sir!
It is this---that there is no such thing as freedom.
That God only can be freeand that freedom is
Omnipotence
.
But you take away man's accountability, by that
doctrine, said Mr. Paynim, peevishly; and confound
moral with physical freedom.
YesI know it; moral and physical freedom are
inseparable. I hold too, that man will not be punished
for any thing that he does.
Nor rewarded? continued the other, eagerly.
Nor rewarded, echoed Hammond; that is a
part of your own doctrine, that there is no
merit
in
man's good actions.
And you make the Deity, the author of sin, said
Mr. Paynimwith a scornful, but compassionate
expression
of the lip.
Yes, sirof all, that you call
sin
. All that
happens
,
happens by his permission; nay, by his
authority
.
He
can
prevent it, but does not. He is
infinitely
wise, good, powerful:---of course, what we call
sin,
is
consistent with infinite wisdom, goodness, and
power. Nay, more---God is the author of all law, the
violation of which constitutes sin. Being the author,
he can suspend it at pleasure. It is only necessary,
therefore, that he should suspend, any given
prohibition
,
and the prohibited deed becomes lawful. Is it
not so? God peopled the world at first, by an
incestuous
communion, between the sons and daughters
of Adam. He sent his angel among the nations; and
they melted away in the breath of his nostrils. The
earth runs with blood at his bidding. He commands
one man to slay another---nay, to slay thousands, and
tens of thousands!---He orders the Egyptians, to be
spoiled of their gold and silver, by the Israelites; he
permits his chosen one, David, to sin upon the house
top with a woman. Here then are murder,
adultery
,
incest, and theft, all done by his direct
authority
.
And what is the consequence? They cease to be
criminal
.
vol ii. T 2
Abraham is commanded to offer up Isaac.----
He proceeds to the work of death. Suppose, that he
had done it.
But he would never have done it, said the
clergyman
.
Ah! replied Hammond; then why is Abraham
celebrated for his faith, and obedience? But, suppose,
that he
had
done it; who would have dared to censure
him? Who would have dared to resist the angel of
the Lord? This night---suppose, sir, that
this
night,
one of us should be convinced, in his understanding,
and heart, by a vision, that he was ordered of God to
offer up some babe---and suppose that he obeyed.
Would he sin?
No---he would he a madman. The age of such
communication with heaven, is past.
You see---sir, said Hammond, with increasing
solemnity
;
that, what we call sin, when done, or
authorized
by God, ceases to be sin. Nay---if you pursue
it for a moment, you will see, that, without
sin
, there
would be no
virtue
no
suffering
---and,
consequently
,
no patience, fortitude, compassion, sympathy,
resignation---nor
piety,--no virtue, nor shadow of virtue.
It is a subject, sir, which I hoped to avoid; many, and
many a weary, sleepless night, have I passed; and I
had nearly come to the resolution once, of never
speaking upon it, again; and I do it now, with
reluctance
.
I long to hear it refuted---sir! as I am a
living man, I would go down on my knees, before any
human being, who would convince me, that I am a
free
agent
---morally free;
capable
of doing right and
wrong.
I would recommend professor Reid, to you, said
the other, as if he pitied Hammond.
Professor Reid!---Sir, I have read him, through
and through; again, and again. I mean no disrespect
to you; but I am more familiar with him than you are.
He has deceived himself; no wonder that he has
deceived
others. He is the champion of your side; but
I have set my foot upon his neck. Professor Reid!---
yes, sir; and, after reading, and writing, upon the
subject
;
and refuting professor Reid, and discomfiting
every man that opposed me; making converts, when I
neither sought, nor desired it; awing presumption into
silence; and prejudice into nothingness, I met with the
letters, that passed between Frederick and Voltaire,
on the subject; and I found that I had
answered
without
ever having seen them; the
very
doubts and
objections
,
on both sides, which Frederick and Voltaire,
themselves, had pronounced to be
unanswerable
.
Can you pretend to believe that you are
not
free---
Mr. Hammond, when you are acting every hour of
your life, as if you believe it; and, are continually
planning
for the future---said Elizabeth.
My dear Miss Adams, said he, with an air of the
deepest, and most affectionate sincerity. That is man's
nature
. Who acts according to his belief? Nobody.
We
believe
that there are no apparitions---no spectres;
yet we are all more or less frightened in the dark. We
believe
that we shall die, every one of us, and be judged.
Yet, who acts as if he really believed it. We
know
that death is inevitable---yet we act as if we knew that
it
could not
happen.
But why should we reason? said Elizabeth,
interfering
again, to keep down the warmth of Hammond.
Do we not
feel
in every pulse, thought, and throb, that
we
are
free?
Yes!--that is the unanswerable argument after, all,
said Mr. Paynim;---we have the highest possible
evidence
of our freedom; and, therefore, we
are
free.
Professor Reid says the same thing, Hammond
replied. But I answer
thus
:In the
first
place, it is
not
true that we have this evidence. In the next place;
if we had it, it would not prove that we are free,---and
finally, though our consciousness and our
understanding
should unite in their testimony to our freedom
still, they might deceive usstill we might
not
be so.
Upon my word!---cried the clergyman,
breathless
with astonishment, What evidence would you
have?
I would have the evidence of my reason, because
it is
higher
than that of consciousness,not because
it would be conclusive.
But are not the
evidence
of your
reason
, and
consciousness
the same thing?---said Elizabeth.
Ah, my dear Miss Adams, said the clergyman,
smiling, you had better not trouble your head any
more with metaphysicks.
Why not? answered Hammond, seriously.---I
am sure, that she makes the proper distinction
between
reason
and the
evidence
of
reason
. You will
find her able to comprehend your most attenuated
and subtle distinctions---(Elizabeth blushed, and
bowed
)---he
continued. No---I care little, or nothing,
for what the wise have said on the subject. I have
my own notions. Consciousness in us, is like instinct
in animals. It is something, that anticipates the
deduction
of reason;---something, that is antecedent to
experience. However, it matters little in what sense
we use it here: for, a little reflection will convince us,
that
consciousness
is not infallible. A dreamer, a
lunatick
,
a disordered man; one in a passion, or
intoxicated
;---each
will have a
consciousness
that is false,---each
will be
conscious
for a time, that he
is
, what he is
not
.
A crazed old man may be
conscious
that he is a
monarch
.
Is
he a monarch? A drunken man may be
conscious
that he is sober. Is he sober? A dreamer
may feel a
consciousness
, that he is tumbling from a
precipice. Is he tumbling from a precipice? Unless
you answer in the affirmative, that man
is
, whatever, he
is conscious of being, you must give up the point that
man is free,
because
he is conscious of being free. Just
so, may his understanding play false---his reason.
But, said the clergyman, You have not shown
what you promised, that we have
not
this
consciousness
.
It would require too much time. I can only speak
for myself. I never propose to do a thing, or even
resolve
to do it; but, in a qualified way. I do not feel
convinced
that I am at liberty to do
anything
.
Nay---that is too bad, said I---You do not feel
satisfied or
convinced
, at this moment, that you are at
liberty to lift your hand to your face!
No---when I
reflect
upon it, I do not. While I only
feel
, I admit that I act, as if I did
feel
free; and that is
only while I do not think at all. Many things might
happen to prevent me; a change of mind; some
muscular
affection; the cramp; palsy or death. You smile---
and, not, if you will allow me to say so, asbut no
matter. All, that we do, is subject to some accident,
restraint, or contingency. So, all that we resolve to
do.
Why, sir, if I understand you right, you make
freedem
to consist in entire independence---(said the
clergyman
)in
a sort of animal powernot a
moral
power
,
of choice.
True, sirin a
moral
power, which is incapable of
physical
controlin OMNIPOTENCE. You are startled
but
I amI confess itif your doctrine be at all just,
only one Being can be
free
.
That is exactly what I said, when I began, sir,
answered
Hammond.
And yet, said Elizabeth, timidly, her pleasant,
lovely, impatient eyes dashed with shadow and light, as
she raised them reverently to the clergyman;I have
always been led to beheve, that guilt or innocence
were in the mind, alone;that he, who meditates a
murder, though he be unable to complete it, is a
murderer
;that
moral guilt is in the
thought
not in the
deed;
that he who kills another, without intending it,
is innocent; and that he, who puts poison into the food of
another, which is not eaten; or gives a balsam, by
mistake
,
when he would drug another's heart with death,
is a
murderer
in his soul; morally guilty of all that he
meditated.
Surely,
surely
, Mr. Hammond. she continued,
stretching her beautiful hand toward him, till she
almost
touched his shoulder, in her passionate, sweet, yet
lifted earnestnessthe guilt of the heart need not be
consummated by the guilt of the hand!and, if notof
what matter is it, whether we are free to
do
what we
determine, or not, provided that we are
free
to
determine
?
The clergyman's eyes ran overand he held her
hands in his, for a moment.---Beautiful enthusiast,
he said---and the words broke from his lip in fire---he
trembles from head to foot! --this is using your power
and loveliness, upon the earth, as your Heavenly
Father
would have you!
Hammond's broad forehead lightened, absolutely
lightened, as he repeated---Beautiful enthusias! yes
right or wrong, ye will be followed!who may resist
your enchantment!not the strong of heart; for, at
the sound of your voices, the stout hearted fail!not
the powerful in mind, for, at your bidding, they lie
down in the dust! like giants fainting before an
incantation
.
But noI will withstand you:for truth is
mightier than beauty; wisdom, than loveliness. God
is truth. Suppose, he added, approaching
Elizabeth
,
and speaking in a low, composed tone, with
action
full of solemnity and emphasis. Suppose that
it should prove---let me
suppose
the case---that, he who
drugged the food of another with poison---was
not
at
liberty---but did it under some preternatural, hidden,
but irresistible influence, would he be guilty? Suppose
that one, operated upon by
physical
force, or by
persuasion
,
and by nothing else--to kill another, nay, to strike
another with an
intention
to kill him, would he be
guilty? It might be, you know, for self preservation---
as if he were thrust against another---upon a piece of
ice, where only one
could
stand. Suppose him to be
excited to it by wine, or eloquence, or fanatacism, or
visions from heaven, or madness---would he be guilty,
then?
You crowd your questions too thickly upon me,
answered Elizabeth. Yet, I should think him
guilty, only in proportion as he was
free;
and that his
guiltiness diminished, exactly in proportion to the
influence
operating upon him, whether intellectual or
corporeal
.
Thank you, cried Hammond; thank you, Eliza---
Miss Adams, I mean. Now we are coming to the
point! We shall soon become altogether intelligible
to each other. We are not so wide of the truth, as we
have imagined. The drunken man: the crazed one:
the fanatick---each may have given the blow, with an
intent to killeach
believing
that he was
free
yet,
after all, when God shall try him, his guilt or
innocence
will depend, as you have already admitted,
not
upon his own belief, or
consciousness
of freedom; not
upon
the
intention
to killbut, upon the
fact
, whether he
was really free or not(whatever were his
belief:)
and
he will be
guiltless
of blood, in proportion to the
influence
that operated upon him.
The clergyman regarded him with alarm, as he
proceeded
.
You are wrong, therefore, Elizabeth; and Dr. Reid,
great and good as he may have been, is wrong; and all
of you are wrong. Let me give you, substantially,
one of Dr. Reid's arguments. The foreknowledge of
God, said he, is no more incompatible with man's
freedom
,
than his memory is: that is, if
we
had no faculty
of memory;
it
would be as inconceivable to us, as
foreknowledge
is now. We could never be made to
comprehend
,
how he could remember a thing that was past;
any more than we can now comprehend, how he should
foreknow
a thing, that is to come, without, in some way,
affecting
the liberty of the agent. Now, it is true, says Dr.
Reid, that we
are
able to comprehend it, &c. &c.---but
why repeat such an argument: alas, for the wisdom and
honesty of such men. Their blindness would be
inconceivable
,
were it not so evident. I answer him thus.
Granted
. I am willing to grant all that you ask
every thingin yourown language, too, if you please A
thing
must
have been, before it could be remembered.
Yes. And if foreknown, it
must be!
Yes. That is
enough. We care not, whether foreknowledge and
freedom
be, or be not irreconcileable. It is enough for us, that,
for some reason, no matter what, whether by the
constitution
of things, or not---or, whether,
because
it was
foreknown or not---it is enough for us, that, whatever
is foreknown,
must
take place. If it
must
take place,
the agent is not free. Yes, I repeat it, you are all
wreng.
Moral guilt
does not consist in the
determination
of the
will
, or of the mind---nor, from whatever we
may
believe
of our freedom---but, upon the
fact
whether
we are free or not. It is, therefore, a begging of the
question,
petitio principii
(that was to the clergyman---
the first part to Elizabeth) to maintain, that the guilt
is in the
will
. The dispute is, whether man is free, or
not. And you do no more than reiterate your own
proposition
....when
you say, first, that man
is
freeand then,
that the guilt is in the will. It is precisely like saying,
that the doctrine is dangerous....for, that is supposing
it false. If
true
, it cannot be dangerous; because,
believe
what we may, it can have no influence upon our
actions. We are
not
free.
I do not see it, said the clergymanDr. Reid
was not so feeble, or blind a logician, as thatan
identical
proposition from Dr. Reid! Oh, no.Pardon
me!
Let me put this question in another shape. I have
a child, of a perverse, obstinate, disobedient temper,
who is particularly fond of a particular kind of fruit.
Willing to try him, I put him into a room, with some
of the fruit; and command him not to touch it, or taste
it. I leave him there. Now, one of your way of
thinking, will say, that the child is
free
to obey, or not;
and that, I may be able to determine, and to
foreknow
,
almost to a certainty, whether he will obey, or not.
Sirhearken to me.Exactly in proportion to my
certainty
, would be his want of freedom: and when I
came to foreknow
positively
, as God is admitted to
foreknow every thing, how he would behave in that
room, he would be no longer free. You smile. Sir---
I do not wonder at it. I do not complain of you. You
pity me---believe me, Sir---I am not deserving of it.
If I am wrong, I am unworthy of compassion: for, I
am wilfully and obstinately convinced, that I am right.
However, to carry the thing one step further.
Suppose
that child to be so disobedient, that, it were
enough to make him do any thing, only to have me
command him not to do it. Suppose that the fruit in
question, was a favourite kind---for which, he had
been longing, for a great while, and had endured
all risks, to obtain---and then, suppose that he were
hungry, even to starvation. In that case, I should be
morally certain of his disobedience, when I hadleft
him in the room with the fruit. But, where would be
his freedom?
The child would be perfectly free, nevertheless---
perfectly free. said the clergyman---
free to choose
.
Ah!---then, if he be perfectly free, in this latter
case, he must be more than perfectly free, in the
former
.
I do not see that.
The temptation is greater in the last case---is it
not? Ah---you do not like to answer.
Is
it,--or is it
not?
It is.
Is temptation an influence?
Certainly---I cannot deny that. Make what use
you can of it.
Then, sir, if he be perfectly free, with a given
quantity of temptation, or influencehe must be
more
than free
, when the influence or temptation is
diminished
.
Well butI do notI beg your pardon, sir. You
are too fast---I.
Allow me, sir, if you please---for a single moment.
Now, I do not contend---nor, is it necessary that I
should contend, that
my
foreknowledge or prescience,
in the case of the child, has any necessary influence
on, or connection with,
his
conduct. I am willing to
grant, if you please, all that Dr. Reid, or anybody
can ask; that foreknowledge,
of itself
, has no influence
at all (for the sake of argument, I mean) on the
freedom
of an agent. But, all that I contend for, is, that,
exactly in proportion to the
certainty
of
my
knowledge
,
or prescience; or that of any being, whatever,
of any event, or in relation to any event, or the action
of any agent; that,
just in that proportion
, is the
necessity
that that event should happen; and that agent act,
no matter for what reason. I care not
why
it
must
happen---it is enough for me, that it
must
happen, in
proportion, as it is
certainly
foreknown.
Well. God foreknows every thing, certainly,
absolutely
,
and without qualification.
VOL. II. U
Consequently, all that he foreknew, or foreknows,
must
happen,
as
he foreknew, or foreknows it: just
as the child
must
eat the fruit, in the case mentioned,
if I, or any body, man or Deity, foreknew
certainly
,
that he would eat it.
Therefore, sir, do I repeat, that the determination
of the
will
is not, even when it takes place, apart from
all visible influence, but in mere rebellion, and
downright
disobedience to God, as it may appear, not only
to us---but, to the man himself, who rebels, and is
disobedient
is
not the measure of
moral guilt
.
And yet sir---mark me. If Dr. Reid were this
moment
arraigned before the Judge of all the world; and
condemned, for some deed, done in the body---done, too,
while he
believed
, that he was
free
to choose and
determine---what
would he say, if he found,
then
, that he
never
had
been free? Would he not, if he had the
power, remonstrate? Would he not say---Spare me,
O, God, spare me! I was under a delusion....I was
deceived....I thought that I was free....yet, now, I
know that I was
not
...that I was ever, in my
will
,
determined
by another power....even by thee, O, God! for,
from thee, cometh all influence....all attraction....wilt
thou punish me, O, my Father! that I was unable to
fathom thy mystery. Lo, my brother is standing at
my side....Upon the earth, he dipt his hands into the
heart of his own children....even as thy servant, of
yore, was called upon, to do....he believed that he
was commissiones to do this....behold him, trembling,
before thee....he was deceived. Shall he be punished?
This may be eloquence; nay, it
is
eloquence, Mr.
Hammond, said Elizabeth, but it is not argument.
The poor creature believed that he was doing right;
but we are speaking of those, who believe that they are
doing wrong!
I confess it, answered Hammond, turning a little
pale. Yet, yet! I pray you, bear with me: if it
should prove, at the great day of account, that he who
had done some terrible crime upon this earth,
wilfully
,
and
intending
to do wrong; and
believing that he
was at liberty
to do it, or not; if he should find, at last,
that he was under a delusion; that he was
not
at
liberty
to forbear; and that he could
not
have done
otherwise
;
would he submit patiently, to his punishment.
I care not who, or what he is. I dare to say
no
. I
dare to say that Jehovah, himself, will not,
cannot
punish
the man, unless he
was
free. You tremble---I do
not. I have confidence in God's attributes. I believe
that he cannot be unjust.
Then God himself, is not free, said Elizabeth.
Hammond stopped, confounded, overwhelmed---
but, it was only for a moment. Yes, he added, God
is free; and may do what he will. I retract what I
said. Do what he may, though it be contrary to all
our notions of right and wrong; yet it must be
right
, in
him. Still, do I believe, though I do not tremble, that
whatever
is, is right;
and that He will have mercy
upon all that he hath fashioned.
But what confidence can you have in this opinion?
unless God himself, be subject to some immutable law,
of his own nature; and if he be, she continued.
And if he
be!
answered Hammond, standing
upright
,
like one suddenly struck blind; but he soon
recovered
himself. If he be! that law is God! no matter
what that law is; no matter how it operates; if there
be
any
law, which
compets
the Being, whom we call
God---to any mode of action; pay which
influences
him, in the smallest degree; though it be
in
his own
naturehe faltered, his brow wrought intently in its
darkness---his great blood-shot eyes waned---his lips
moved, but no sound came from them.
Now! cried Elizabeth;
now!
Mr. Hammond do
I see you where I have been hoping to see youin the
deep ocean--the deep,
deep
ocean of God's nature---now
is it that I see your reason totter! your,ajestick
nature
struck with darkness, abashed and shaking in the
contemplation of it. O, Albert! (the tears filled her
eyes, and she stopped.)
I know not, said Hammond, in an humbler tone,
I know not what this feeling may mean. I have
thought many a weary year upon the subject---
wrestled
with strong men---written, and talked upon
it---but
never; no,
never
, till this moment, have I felt its
frightful incomprehensibleness. I can believe yet---I do
believe it--that
I am not free;
yet, I will act so, if I can, so
that, if it should prove at last, that
I am free, or have been
free
, I shall be on the safe side. Yet, what
confidence
can I have in the mercy, or benevolence of God,
unless I believe that his nature is, of
necessity
,
benevolent
and merciful:---and, having gone thus far, I
establish
a
necessity
superiour to him. Well, be it so---I will
not---I never did, and I never will shrink from any
conclusion, however appalling, to which my reason
hath conducted me. The highest principle then;
the God of all-nature---is Benevolence. Whatever that
God does, we have agreed to call by the highest, best
of names. To that God,
necessarily
omnipotent,
omniscient
,
and all-merciful, I, from this hour, devote
myself, and all my faculties.
You have arrived then, said Elizabeth, locking
her hands, fervently, and lifting up her beautiful eyes
to heaven; you have arrived at wisdom and
consolation
;
that wisdom, which will be very dear and
profitable
to you; that consolation, which will be with you, a
present helper through all tribulation and trial; the
hour of death and the day of judgment.
Hammond looked, as if he could have fallen at her
feet, and buried his mouth in the dust. The
sweat stood upon his white lips---his hands were
violently agitated, for some moments, as he
vainly
attempted to reply, while the clergyman sat,
with shining eyes, and mouth open, in mute
admiration
of her passionate enthusiasm.
Elizabeth, said Hammond, after a few minutes of
deep, unbroken silence, I cannot deceive you. I have
had leisure to think. My spirit has been above, in
the presence-chamber of our Father, since I heard
your voice; and stood there, with her face covered,
and---and---this---
this
hath been written upon her
forehead. There is
one
Lord God of Heaven and
Earth; and but
one!
Whatever he does, he does, by no
law; no influence; no necessity; but, by the free
operation
of his own will. Our confidence, in his mercy
and benignity, and power, is not deducible from any
fixed law of his nature, but from our experience and
reason. Whatever he does, or suffers, or permits, or
authorizes, is not only
right
, and
wise;
but
wisest,
most right, best
. He has entirely surrounded us by
innumerable
influences and attractions; subjected us to
the accidents of education; the contingencies of
material
things; the operation of spiritual things; filled us
with passions, and appetites; and subjected them all
to temptation and trial. Whether we be free
at all
,
it is impossible to determine. Our reason declares
that we are
not
so; our feeling that we
are
. In what
degree, we are free, we shall never know. But that
we are
not
entirely free, is as certain, as that entire
freedom must be a power incapable of being
influenced
;
agitated or attracted; subject to no passion,
appetite
,
or law; inaccessable to temptation or trial,
whether
of earth or heaven, material or immaterial---and
nay, more, I cannot admit any thing like degrees of
freedom
. There may be degrees of slavery. To be
freeor rightat all--is to be wholly
free
, and wholly
right
, and.
Pray, no more, now. I hear a step.
The door opened, and Mr. Larence entered; a
young man who had long been a devout admirer of
Elizabeth. (She gave him her hand, at one,
unaffectedly
.)
Really! Mr. Larence, said she, I am very glad
to see you. He threw up his dim sunken eyes, to hers--
and attempted to speak.
I(a slight, tremulous movement of his chin
followed
.)
I hope that your long absence has been of
service to you(she faltered)to your health.
Miss Adams, he replied, while his handsome,
melancholy
features lighted up, for a moment, with an
expression of intense feeling. I---II thank you----
I cannot flatter myself, that it has been. My
long
absence---has
not cured
me
.
He laid a deep emphasis upon the words
long
, and
me;
--and Elizabeth, concealing some emotion, smiled
faintly, as if she considered it in the light of
pleasantry
;
but he did
not;
he grew more seriousand the
vol. ii. U 2
conversation became more and more distrustful,
timid, and reluctant. All have felt a strange
unwillingness
,
to begin a conversation, during a dead
silence
.
It is like
beginning
a letter; or a speech; a
thousand times more difficult, than(
ending
it, I
was about to say, but that, I know by experience, to
be yet more difficult) than continuing it, then, I will
say. You cannot trifle at firstevery eye is upon
you; every ear open; and it is the devil to be serious,
at the onsetwhen every body is listening to you.
This Mr. Larence was a slender, interesting
young man; one of the most interesting, that I ever
sawand, absolutely, the most elegantwho, if ever
a man was devoted to a woman, was devoted to my
sister, heart and soul. His family, talent,
reputation
,
and character, to all the world, but her and
me, were unexceptionable; to
her
, I know not for
what reasonhe was a great favourite with the
women
;
and what is really unaccountable, he
deserved
to
beand to me, only, they were not, because I could not
bear to think of sharing her heart; the heart even of my
sister; with any human being; still less, of giving it up
so utterly, as I must, to such a man as George Larence,
if he once got possession of it. But for that, I never saw a
man, to whom I would so readily have entrusted the
happiness of Elizabeth. He was patient under trial;
dignifiedpious; and truly meek, and lowly of heart:
unpretending; but gifted with a blessed, and bright
intellect
;
a pure heart, and a romantick, lordly sense of
honour, without show or parade; never talking for
effect; never aiming to astonish; but winning all
hearts, by the gentleness of his deportment; and the
sweet, mournful tenderness of his genius. A creature,
however, with all his meekness, not to be mocked at,
or touched upon, with impunity. Let me give you an
example, that just occurred to me: I sat by him once,
when a ruffian was awed and confounded, so
completely
,
by the collectedness of his manner; the evenness of
his clear look, that he trembled from head to foot.
Nay, I have seen him bear much; but I never saw any
other symptoms of passion, than a high hearted
heaving of the chest; and a little more brightness than
usual, in his melancholy eyes. I remember, that he
had once been challenged, for some hasty thing that
he had said; and that he had the greatness of heart to
go to the same place; and apologise for the affront,
before the same company, for what he had done. I
asked him why! But let me tell you all about it.
Because I was wrong, said he, mildly; and the
man was rather smaller than I
Yet while he was there, with every eye upon his
pale, placid features, he was goaded to such
desperation
,
by a professed duellist, in consequence of the
apology, that he turned round to him, before the whole
company, and rebuked him, as with the authority of
a superiour being, for the blood that he had spilt.
The other raised his arm.
Do not strike me. Frederick Harding; said he---
it would be unmanly, (his dark sunken eyes, were so
full of severity, and steadiness---so undisturbed; so
beautiful, that the other's arm dropped powerless
before
itand he continued.) You see that I am
unable
to resist your bodily force; that I am, in a
measure
,
helpless, and defenceless; this you can
see;
do
not strike me. The disgrace would recoil upon
yourself
.
You have not a brave heart, Mr. Harding
but it is the desperate heart of an assassin---a
murderer
.
You have that constitutional fearlessness of
death; that regardlessness of God, which would have
made you, what the world calls a hero; but which, by
being shown in the commoner affairs of lifehas
made you only a murderernay, nay, do not threaten
meI
do
believe that you are a
coward
. Well!
threaten
me. I am not to be intimidated. A truly brave
man, Frederick Harding, would never bully a
smaller
one,
in company; and before women
. Naynor
tremble before him, as you do, at this moment,
before
me.
Now strike me, if you dare
!
Strike me,
sirstrike me, if you can
, he added(for the women
had fled from the roomstepping up to him, with his
eyes flashing fire, and trembling with emotion)---
strike me
, if you have the manhood. What! a
pistol---level
it, if you dare!---fire it! You dare not. O,
what a reptile! Gentlemen, look at this man.
Behold
him therethe terrour of the town:one that
had ridden over your hearts; the best and bravest---
trampled all the courtesies of life into the dust;
bullying
his way through societydripping with the blood
of one of the best men, that ever trod this earth!
Behold him!---going armed into the assembly of
women
insulting
mea man, of half his weight: and
why? because he knew me to be principled against
duelling; and because he had just heard me offer an
apology to one, that I had injured; and because he
believed
me to be a
coward!
I, a coward; when he---
the dastard; hath not the strength to lift his hand.
Begone!sir!---leave the room, this instant;---or I
will cowhide you upon the spot.
Saying this, he pressed upon the fellow; who, black
in the face, with passion, and frothing at the lips,
cocked the pistol, which till then had remained
uncocked
,
with a shaking hand; and levelled it.
Another step, said he, menacing, inarticulately---
I was thunderstruck at what I thought the rashness of
Larence; and sprang forward to arrest the shot; but
the pistol was already struck from his hand---the
room rang; and the ball rattled along the wall, and
through the window. Larence stood at the door,
unharmed; and the discomfited wretch, overcome with
his sense of inferiority, and shame, walked sullenly
away.
While we were yet pressing about the heroick
Larence
,
who stood, with his fine eyes running over in
thankfulness to heaven; and so weak, that he could
hardly stand; another young man entered, and
handed
a note to him.
Larence instantly recovered himself; stood
upright
,
with a calm forehead, and untroubled mouth.
Why could not I have done the same? I know
not
, but
I
could
not---I never could---my heart would have
burst, while his only bled, in such a silence---but
Larence
was a hero---I was not---I was only a man; a
man!---I was less than a man. He read it through.
Do you know the contents of that scrawl, young
man? said he.
The other bowed haughtily.
It is a challenge, gentlemen, said Larence,
handing
a dirty paper to me--and the fellow cannot write
English---nor spell; he begins every word with a
capital
;
and writes up hill---poh, poh! (he added, glancing
with a pleasant look upon the bearer;) don't put on
any of these airs here, sir---you are a young man.
But the other persisted.
Look you, said I, my lad--stepping up to him,
with half a mind to pitch him out of the window; but
Larence rebuked me---walked composedly before me;
and stood tearing up the note, leisurely, while he
added
,
in a cheerful, but determined tone
You are young, sir; I pity you---I would not hurt
your
feeling; but I shall take care, that
you
, as well
as the scoundrel who sent you, are properly punished
for this frolick. Nay, don't approach me. You do not
know, perhaps, whom you have to deal with. I said
before, that I
pitied
you;if you do not go soon, I
shall
despise
you; and, probably, make you despise
yourself. The coward that sent you, I do not fear; if
he attack me, I shall know how to defend myself --but
I shall put both of you into safe keeping, directly.---
Stand by, sir! and let me pass: you had better stand a
little aside; for so sure as you are a living manor
boy, rather; if I am once provoked, I shall give you a
lesson for
your
impudence, that will not be very
palatable
.
Saying this, he attempted a third time, to force his
way out; but the other put his hand upon his collar.
Larence
gently displaced it, with one of his; and threw the
torn paper into his face, with the other.
That was going too far; and the stranger darted a
blow, quicker than lightning, at his face.
Whether Larence received it, or notI cannot tell:
he certainly did not return it; and yet there was the
sudden noise of a blow; as if a bone had been broken
and the stranger's arm dropped powerless at his side;
and his youthful forehead contracted in agony. I
looked at him in amazement: he turned deathly pale,
and staggered against the wall; attempting, again,
and again, to raise his arm; but it refused obedience
to his will, and hung, as if dislocated.
I was afraid of some evil to Larence, who walked
leisurely and silently away, after throwing a
compassionate
glance upon the handsome young stranger;
and I followed him; we had never been well
acquainted
till then; but from that hour, we became intimate,
and continued so, till, I never knew for what, he
became
unaccountably dejected; avoided our house; and
went to the Indies.
Reader, there is a part of my life, that I
cannot,
cannot
,
bear to dwell on. If some suspicion should
obtrude
itself upon you, pass it overin charity, if you
canin pity, if you have the heart. During that
period
,
it was, that Larence had left America.
I was glad to see him return; yet sorrowful on his
account; for, after a few minutes, I saw that Elizabeth
was under a painful restraint in his presence; that she
wished to soothe his noble spirit, but dared not, lest
it should give him encouragement, where it was not
meant. Her manner grew colder and colder, in spite
of herself; and his, more troubled and dejected; till at
last, unable to endure it any longer, he arose.
Miss Adams, said he, firmly; and then he spoke
more faintlythe words were scarcely intelligible;
but it appeared to me, that they were something like
these,
I see that I have no hope;
and then, in a
louder
tone; he added, bowing low ten thousand miles;
three whole years have I passed, merely that I might
see you once more
alone
, if it were possible
entirely
alone
. Will you permit me an opportunity? Do
not refuse mecan I see you to nighttomorrow
the next dayfor a single moment? I hope that I am
not presumptuousforgive me, for my importunity---
no, no, dearest of women, I cannot leave you; will not,
though forty thousand strangers were near you, till--
Elizabeth, as I could see, (being the nearest to her)
had been motioning to him, pale as a spectre, to
beware
.
I knew her motive; she was unlike other
women
.
She would not lure her victim to absolute
humiliation
,
where there was no hope; and she arose,
agitated nearly to death---took his hand---firmly
persuaded
,
I am sure, that nothing less could prevent him
from exposing his fine heart to the world.
Yes, my
friend
, said she I will see you, alone;
and immediately. I know your intention. I know
the purport of what you would tell me. (This, she
attempted
to say, in a tone of pleasantry; but her eye
filled, and her red lip quivered and swelled.)
Brother
,
you will be so kind as to entertain our
other
friends, till I return. I shall walk with Mr. Larence
to see
Emma Larence
. Ah brother! you colour! I
see that you would like to be one of the party; but it
won't do to-night---farewell.
Reader, I must stop---it is the first time that I have
written
her
name---my hand shakes---I---I---farewell---

Let me try again. This Emma Larence was the sister
of George Larence, of whom I have justreader
pardon
methere is no affectation in thisno trick. I
have been abroad, in the cold open air, since I threw
down my pen; and, I thought, when I returned, that I
could take it up again, with a stout heart, and a steady
hand, ahow strange it is! The tumultthe
sickness
,
like deaththe suffocation have gone bya few
minutes only have passed; and I feel as if I were in a
pleasant dream; and yet there is a sense of soreness all
over me, as if, somewhere, I had been suddenly
thrown down by a strong hand; or shipwrecked, in a
high wind; and drifted ashore, upon some desolate
blossoming islet. There is a low, continual
murmuring
musick all about me; the tall beautiful grass and
clear water are full of itthere isI cannot well
describe
itwhenever I shut my eyes, a near, sweet,
passionate vibration of the very air that I breathe
so that my lungs tremble, as I inhale itas if I
breathed an atmosphere of harmony. There is a
feeling too, that--I cannot describe it, it is impossible
a sense of brightness and dizzy, suffocating beauty,
thatwell, well. Ah! where am Iwhat have I
been doing. Friends! pardon me; I will try again

* * * * * * * * * *
This Emma was the sister of George Larence, of
whom I have just spoken. It was Emma that I
mentioned
some chapters ago; as having seen her with her
white, graceful neck glittering in the sun, once, when
Hammond and I were walking together. She was
leaning out of the window, if you recollect, to fasten
back the blinds. It was the night when Hammond
was stabbed; have you forgotten it? I became
acquainted
with her, immediately after that affair; and I
should have mentioned it, step by step, but I dared not.
Indeed I could not; it was impossible. I have
hurried
over a large part of my eventful life; I have
crowded together incidents and adventures that
happened
years, nay, many years apart. I have
omitted
many things; and written, at times, with a
vehement
and distracted eagerness, about other people;
but all to no purpose. It will not do. I cannot keep
the secret. I
must
tell itI mustif it be only that
I may lay down, with an exhausted heart, when I
have done; and cover my face for the last time, and
give up the ghost, quietly. Would that I could stop
where I am! Would that I could lock my poor hands,
even here! and fall asleep for the last time, over the
torn and wet record of my sorrow and transgression!
But no! no! it cannot be. The trial is appointed to
memy destiny must be fulfilled; and then, I may be
ableO, reader, join thou thy prayer with mine; for,
wherever I am when thou art reading thisdead or
aliveit may
not be too late
that I may be able to
look an angel on the face. Pray with me, reader!
While you are reading this, I am a dead manpray
with me! it is not too latepray with me, that I may
be forgiven. It will do you some good, though it do
me none---pray with me! O, pray with me!
But let me recover myself; let me be more of a man.
I will! Hearken to me, then, that you may understand
thoroughly, the waywardness, and savageness of my
nature; for you know enough of my tenderness,
cowardice
and warmth. I have dreaded to approach this
vol. ii. W
part of my life; but the story would be too imperfect,
without it; and my design, from the beginning, was
to
tell it;
and I never abandon a design, good or evil, that
I have once formed. The delay; and all that I have
hitherto related, have been only a system of preparation
for myself;
and even yet, I do not feel so fully
prepared
as I ought to be; but, nevertheless, the time has
come now, and
I will tell it
.
As I approach the days of our love, however, the
love of Emma and me, I feel my heart, as it were,
darkened; and a gentle stirring within the very centre
of it, just as if the little nestling images of my children
that I have kept there, and will keep there, through
all eternity, if God will let me, were moving in it, with
every breath that I drew. And my wife too! O Emma!
Emma! why was I not known to the! why, thou
blessed
one, at the mention of whose namenay, at the
sight of it, written, by the hand of a stranger, my very
heart stops, all at once; and instantly, all the shadowy
void of my past life, clears up behind me, and swarms
with the apparition of beautiful children---whose
children
,
love? Thine and mine! Yea, Emma! Thine and
mine! Thy sweet baby, the first blossom of our love---
the delicate miniature transparency of thyself, and thy
purity---and the brave boy that followed her, to the
green nest in the churchyardO Emma! why was I
not known to thee!
Ah my wife! my wife!---Anna, the loveliest babe, that
ever opened her violet eyes, upon the white bosom of a
mother---and thou too, Liester!O, who would abide
a separation so terrible---a survivership so desolate---
were it not that---no Emma! no---I never will sully
thy purity, by a thought like that!thou hast been, thou
art
, faithful to mebut---O, love, had thy
affectionate
nature been but a little more resolute---had all my
prayer and fondness done but a little more for thee---
or hadst thou been a little less mysterious, and silent,
in thy love but, no---no---I will not tell it, yet. I
will put off the evil day---till all my affairs are settled
with the world;---and then, if it please God, having
told my sorrow, I will lie down, I care not where, as
near her grave, and the green bed of my little ones, as
I possibly canand die. Poor, dear Liester!---I
might have known, that I was about to lose thee
thy clinging affection as we parted;---so many times,
the dear little fellow called me back, and kissed---and
kissed me, till his little lips were fevered with the
repetition
;---and
thou too, my babe---
dear
little Anna---so
patient---when thy mother wept, at thy petulance---to
see thy little hand wiping away her tears; and thy red
mouthO, my babe! my babe!yes, yes----
and thy last low murmuring in our ears---Good night,
father!---good by'e cousin---good by'e,and then,
while thy blue eyes were yet shining with life and
beauty; and thy pale forehead was yet damp, damp as
death---suddenly struck to marble---death struck---
II---Oh, Maker of men!have pity upon the
sorrowing of a father
Thursday Night
.
I have been abroad all day. I am afraid to look
back, on what I have written. There is a confused
dreaming in my head, as of musick and pretty children,
---but, it may be that I have been writing of my own---
of my Anna, and of Leister; and of my beloved Emma.
Stop!---I will be more firm---more of a man---the place
of tears, the fountain of tenderness, hath been broken
up. I feel easier now.
When Anna died, it was a terrible blow to me; and
I cannot look back on my feeling, now, without horrour.
So little concerned was I,---so little apprehensive of
calamity---there---
there
where I was so happy, that I
had well nigh forgotten my God. While
her
little
arms were about my neck; and
her
innocent warm lips
put against my cheek---that---that---I had but a few
hours for preparation; and, even to the last; the very
last---till the flower turned black, all at once, upon
the stem---and rotted in my sightthere was hope,
even to distraction!How I bore it, heaven only
knows---all was darkness, for awhile---then incessant
flashes of fire, breaking out, here and there, for a little
time---till I came sufficiently to myself, to find my own
dear, dear Emma. O, had she loved me, as I loved
her!---sitting patiently by my side, with Liester in her
arms---her pale lips riffled of their colour; and her
clear temples stained all over with the blue meandering
of her life-blood---as if she had thinned away, in her
sorrow, till her heart and all its doings were to be seen,
visibly
,---as through a transparency. And then Leister
went---and---though I knew it not---for I was away
away among the barbarians; leaving
her
Oh,
heaven
,
and earth!how was I able to do it!to die alone,
and away from meO Emma! * * * * Lord!
Lord!it is impossible---I must leave it awhile
my keeper is at handI hear his tread
I have spoken before of my fear of death. It was a
part of my blood, I believe. About this time, when
I had most reason to love life, it was at the height.
Think what I suffered! No human creature would believe
me, were I to tell him the frightful, and everlasting
apprehension
,
that used to crowd in upon me, whenever
I was left alone;and, particularly, at night. It
were enough to drive any man, I care not how great,
or how good---he might beraving distracted. I
wonder
how I bore it. I have often thought that no
other man that ever lived, could have outlived bodily,
to say nothing of his faculties being destroyed by it
---the strange, dark, perplexing, indefinite horrour that
continually troubled me, like a cold wet atmosphere, and
an eternal shadow; as if all that was beautiful and
bright in heaven and earth---the stars, and the cherubim
Jehovah and his angels---were all in eclipse to me.
O, it cannot be described. It haunted me, day and
night. I slept, but to dream of death; and I awoke,
but to shake at the thought of it; with a continual
inroad
of darkness upon me---and this too,
unaccountable
that it was! while I was the first, and foremost, in
every headlong and perilous adventure.
Sunday Morning
.
We were sitting together, Elizabeth and I, the next
evening after that mentioned in the last chapter. Bear
with me, reader, I will bring thee, soon enough now,
to the end of my sorrowing. She was uncommonly
serious.
Elizabeth, said I---when does George go away
again? Immediately, I believe, was her reply;
and she turned away her face.
No other woman, I continued; no other woman,
upon the earth, would have had the same forbearance
and delicacy.
Brother!said Elizabeth---her lips trembling as
she turned to me
Brother!
I will not affect to
misunderstand
you. I know well your meaning. But
you are mistaken. Many, and many a woman would
have done the same thing.
Many a woman! said I, bitterly---Many a one!---
there is not that one living, except my sister, who
would not rather hear the tale of love; though she knew,
in her own heart, that she ought not to listen to it;
and could not reward it---though it came with the
melody of
death;
from the heart that uttered it---
than
Stop, my brother---stop, I beseech you---there are
many---Emmaah!---you are willing to make
one
exception
,
I see!you are a true Mosleman; a
Mahommed
;
none have
souls
but your sister and your
beloved
!
Brother!
I turned, alarmed at the sudden alteration of the tone
it was a faint crywhat ails you, Elizabeth? said I.
Tell meI cannot believe it, was her replyand
yet I cannot believe it altogether invention. Did you
ever say that you could
seduce
any woman in the
world.
I never
said
sosaid I, laughing.
William!Brother!for mercy sakedo not trifle,
now. Have you ever
thought
so?what
is
your
opinion
of women? what
have
you said?
NoI never have
thought
so. My opinion, you
know. The more that I know of women, the more I
venerate some; the more I despise the
many
. But, I
do not despise them for their frailty;not for that,
VOL. II. W 2
which women despise themselves for; for
that
is often
the effect of art and villany, which none could resist
of a secret influence and passion, that God meant to
to be nearly irresistible.
What mean you, brother?
You blush, Elizabeth. Let me deal plainly with
you. Do you believe that any woman would ever
submit
to the pangs of child-birth; the agony of a mother;
her anxiety, slavery and watchfulness; never sleeping,
but at distracted intervals; and for ever wretched in
her passionate care of her offspring; unless there were
within her, a constantly operating attraction toward
man, which God meant to be
irresistible
or nearly so.
No, Elizabeth; it is in vain that you would conceal it.
You have passions like menstronger indeed; or you
are dealt partially with; for your suffering is altogether
more severe than oursand there must be something
to compensate you. Well! You have hearts like us---
all that your education does for you, by that restraint,
which makes you so attractive, sensitive, and amiable,
is to multiply your danger a thousand fold. Give a
woman
any
excuse for tendernessanyI care not
whatlet her find something to love,
lawfully
,
something
,
I care not what---for the love of which, she need
not be ashamed, and will not be reproachedand see
how she will dote on it; a doll; a flower; a bird; a kitten;
a parrot; a lover; a husband; or a child. This it is
which you call the harlotry of the heart, when not
sanctified by a certain ceremonyas if that, which is
wrong in itselfcould be made right, by a few idle
words.
Speak more plainly, brotherdo you allude to the
ceremony of marriage? Call you that
idle?
I do. Who married Adam and Eve? Who made
it a religious ceremony? See the variety; the foolish
tricks, that are played off, in different nations, by way
of legalizing the natural expression of love.
Here
,
they shake hands,
there
, they say prayers.
Here
, the
bride is taken away by violence;
there
, she creeps
into
the bed of the man, and crouches at his feet, like a
whipped spaniel. Why then, if a nation; a people;
or a
family
may establish a ceremony of marriage, for
themselves, why may not a single pair?
They
may
, said Elizabethbut the law must
compel them to fulfil their duties of the condition; or,
what confidence can they have in each other? What
motive
to indulgence; forbearance---or forgiveness? Who
should educate their children? What would become of the
next generation?
There, dear---
there!
---You have taken the strong
ground. But are you of those, who believe that the
love of a man perisheth after possession?
Can it be denied! are you not all
all
more
sensual
than we? Do ye not;
has
it not grown into a
proverb
,
that the seducer will fly from his victim, if he
can.
And so, you would bind him by marriage!
Yes.
My dear sister!---would that be the doctrine of a
delicate woman? If satiety follow enjoyment, would a
woman consent to hold the man, by
law
---whom, but
for the law, she could
not
hold? Would not his caresses
and endearment be a thousand times more affecting,
while she knew that they were voluntary---while she
knew that he was
free
---than while she knew that he
could not,
legally
, refuse to caress her. But you are
mistaken---satiety does
not
follow enjoyment. They,
who love purely, love the more, after enjoyment. It is
a more secret, inward, quiet and absorbing love. There
is no loathing; no satiety, where there is no
guilt
---except
there be a great folly, or great brutality.
I can believe youbrother. You must be right
else no delicate woman would ever marrynor ever
yield, for a moment, to that passion, which is the
mysterious
law of her nature. But what
did
you say of
women? Let us return to that subject.
I said thisthat a man may do anything within the
limits of possibility,that,
therefore
, he might, by
fraud or force; by intrigue; or love; in some way or
other, if he would persevere steadily, year after
year, gain
possession
of any woman, that ever lived. By
this, I do not mean that he could
seduce
her; still less; do
I mean that he could corrupt her heartbut that he
could prostrate her; and imprison her, as he would a
manand hold her at his mercy.
For shame, my brotherYou do not know other
women, as you know us; no other, indeedhow then
can you judge of them, so scornfully!
I!--what, when I have seen them seduced, almost
without
excuse---or persuasion---the proud of heart too---the
pure and intellectual:--
comforted
, when they had become
mothers and wives, in their utmost bereavement, and
distraction
,
by baubles, that I would not give to children;
distressed, helpless, and broken hearted, motherless
and childless womenand husbandless womenin the
summer time of their affection, quieted by ribbons, and
bonnets; dolls and sugar plumbsa tea servicea new
carriage, or a party.
Hush! hush!shame on you, caitiffyou are verily
wandering in your allegiance. Take care if I report
youanother
banishment
.
Sister!
Nay, nay brotherthat flashing of the eyes won't
do---what!---ah, pardon me brother,
dear
brother, I did
not mean to trifle with your feeling---do forgive me,
do!
What could I say? I was cut to the heart---Emma
had
banished me once, since our love had begun; and
the interval that wore away, before our reconciliation,
was disconsolate and sorrowful, to both of us, I do
believe
,
beyond all that woman could imagine. To me,
it was like the parting of the grave. I had no
preparation
for it; there was no opportunity for me to put
my lips upon her forehead, reverentially, as I was wont;
---to weep upon her hands; and hear the reverberation
of her heart, to my farewell---O, no---but, it was like
the parting of the sick chamber---the death bed. For
two or three days, she had been sad; and there was a
visible constraint in her lovingness; my pride awoke---
my jealousy of power---for, I would not
share
the heart
of the woman that I love, even with my Maker. Reader,
you start---I do not wonder at it. Yet, it is true; and,
I cannot disguise it.
Wholly God's - or, wholly mine
---must
be the woman of my heart,
That
must be the
most acceptable
worship
, where woman fulfils her
destiny
;
and loves her husband, with all her heart and
soul;
that
the truest religion! Not that I would have
her love her husband, more than the
laws
of God---No!
but, I would have her heart; her affections; her
tenderness
,
altogether, and unqualifiedly, her husband's. In
that way, would she best show her love for God. For
two or three days, there had been a growing concern,
in her blessed countenance; and, at last, she sat by me,
and sang to me, in her own sweet, painfully sweet,
clear voice, the very song, that I
first
heard her sing---
O, never doubt my love!
My heart fainted---thrilled.
I looked up into her face. I saw her passionate eyes
full of solemnity and pathos; her lips moving, as if in
prayer.
Man!
It was the
last
song that she sung to
me;--the
first
, and the
last
. In the morning, at
breakfast
,
we met again; our manner was yet stately; though,
I do believe, that we had little apprehension in our
hearts, of what was about to happen. I had met her;
taken her hand; and seated her at the table; neither of
us had spoken, except to give the usual salutation of
the day. The silence was mournful; and, to me, so
distressing
,
that I was fain to conceal my emotion, by
waiting, sternly, the result. We parted. I saw her
no more. For many a weary month, we never met
again. We dreamt of each other; thought of each
other; prayed for each other; but, I; alone, was able to
speak. She was silent, and pale as death. She tried
hard, to forget me; and flattered herself, for a time,
that she had succeeded; but, I knew her nature, too
well, for that. She was younger than I, and more
sensitive; of course, she would feel more keenly. She
had less experience than I; and, had never felt her
heart stirring with vitality; at the touch of any hand,
or sound of any voice, before mine. Of course, she
would have no experience, to support her, under the
fire, and sickness; and giddy, faint humiliation;
nothing
to put her upon her guard, against the inroad of
sweet thought, and delirious dreaming. Add to this,
that I was a
man;
mingling, every hour, with the
incessant
bustle, and clamour of life; never alone, and
capable of turning all my faculties, immediately, into
any
channel, that I pleased. I knew this; I felt it; and,
when she said
farewell
to me, I pitied her; blessed her,
in my heart, and wept aloud; wept upon my kneesfor
I knew that, with all my faults, I was the only man on
earth, to make her happy; and, the only one, whom she
could ever love. I said so; but, who could believe me?
I even went furtherfor, I could not contemplate the
desolation, and darkness, and stillness, that I foresaw,
assembling about the sunshine and beauty of one, whom
I had so loved, without quaking, inwardly. I was
willing to lay down my life for her; nay, more; I was
willing to bind my pride, and self-love, hand and foot;
and lay them down at her feet. I did so. Butheaven
lent her strength. She stood up; pale, but
stout-hearted
yet; and turned away her face to my prayer. How
perversely we are constituted! From that hour, I
swore, in my spirit, to win her, or die. I could have
broken her heart; I
could;
it would have been an easy
matter; for, she
had
loved me; but, I scorned to do it.
What there was evil in my nature, had disappeared, at
her approach. My temper lay, prostrate, before her.
Many, and many a month passed away, in weariness
and faintness; yet, I faltered not; and shethe blessed
martyr! though her trials were ten thousand times more
heavy than mine; operating too, in solitude
surrounded
too, by ten thousand insensible things, to lacerate
and weaken her, with fewer consolations; yet, the
heroick girl withstood the whole pressure, till she
was nigh to drop. Both had hours of bitterness and
sorrow; but, both were proud: I waited to
know
that
any advance would be acceptable. And she, with the
sublime delicacy of woman, not only, would not permit
herself, or any of her friends to make any advance; but,
she would not even permit them to signify that, if I
made any, it would be received. Thus went we, upon
our wayI, sorrowing that we might not meet, alone,
where I could tell her, face to face, that I still loved
her; and should love her, to my latest breath; and she,
it may be, sorrowing too, that she had not been less
precipitate, in discharging her heart of its burthen; a
little less sudden and peremptory, in dethroning the
lord of her affection; and wishing that she had
dictated
other terms; such, as would have left her a
prospect
of happiness, with me, after many a year of
self-denial
,
and virtue; and
one, sure
, sure hope of her love.
We might have gone to our graves, with the same
unpropitiating
spirit, devoted, in truth and purity, to each
other; yet, dying, with the heavy secret untold upon
our lips. Thrice, however, had we been near meeting;
once, when an accident had befallen her, and when,
if I had seen her in the arms of another man, in the
trance that she was, I should have thrust him from her;
and never left her again,
never!
until she looked upon
me again, as she had been used to look. And once,
when she happened to enter a house, the moment after
I had left it; when, if we had met, she must have
forgiven
me, though we parted anew, and for ever;and
lastO, I cannot tell how that happened. She was a
catholick girl; and had once been near consecrating
herself to perpetual sorrow; and well nigh becoming a
nun; that most unprofitable of beings; one of them,
whose whole life is spent in making barrenness a
virtue
.
But at last, at last! blessed be heaven! we did meet,
and were reconciled. Never had we loved so truly,
and so devotedly; with that sublimity, which
spiritualises
the passion; taking away all its earthiness; and
etherializing all its essence and issue. And now
now
, while our hearts were just re-uniting, after a
separation
,
like death; just knitting anew, the ruptured
and bleeding filaments that had been torn away, so
violently and suddenly, but, without having lost their
sensibility, or their instinctive movement, for reunion,
when they were brought near to each other; to be told,
just then, when the blood was just beginning to ripple,
again, through the united parts, of another banishment,
another separationOh! it was driving the knife home,
indeed! home, to the vitals! home, to the sundering of
soul and body. I was unable to utter a word. I tried,
but I could notI could only, when Elizabeth threw
herself upon my bosom---with her arms over my neck,
sobbing, as if her dear heart would break---I could
only
say, God bless you, dear---God bless you!
Forgive me, dear Williamspeak to me, O, speak
to meor, if you will notgive me some token that I
am forgiven. I pressed her hand; and she kissed my
forehead, and eyes, till I reeled with blindness.
She had meant no harmand I was ashamed of my
unmanly sorrow; and yet, it was not sorrow; there
was something rather of dismay, and consternation
nay, even of prophecy in it; for my heart was smitten,
as with a leaden sceptreand a voice came from my
lipsunlike the sound of my own voice. My blood was
chilled at the noise of it; as if a spirit had spoken these
words within me. Our
second
parting will be for ever.
My
second
banishment, for all eternity.
Elizabeth shuddered, and looked roundand I
I shuddered too; but I was, like one constrained, and
obliged to speak. She looked pale, and trembled;
and, when she put her hands upon my face, she said;
my brother!your voice sounded very strangely to
meI should not have known it.
I was unable to speak; and we sat, with my arm
about her waist; and her head leaning upon my bosom,
while I held her cold, delicate handsbothin one of
mine, to my heart, which beat, as if it would break its
way through, to be embraced by them.
I wonder, said I, at lastwhile her disordered
hair swept over my eyes, and tickled my lips, until I
was fain to push it aside, hastily; and the wind blew it,
as I did so, all abroad, like a thick, brilliant vapour,
behind us. I wonder, said I, that you can have
the heart, to persist in your resolution, dear, of never
getting married.
That is not true, William, said she, putting her
arm about my neck. You do
not
wonder at it.
I do, indeed; I replieda little maliciously, and
with somewhat of the silly discontented feeling of those
who
love
, but are never satisfied, unless they hear each
other saying, all the time, Oh, I
do
love youO, how
I love you! A woman like you, so fitted for the
companionship
of a high minded fellow; heroick;
virtuous
;
ambitious.
But where am I to find such a man?
Where!
Why there is---George Larence. Nay, nay,
do not put your hands over my mouthI will have it
out.
Upon my word, brother, you are getting
scurrilous
,
she replied, thrusting her beautiful hand
through my hair, and tugging at itI shall not
submit
to it, I assure you.
Then there is (I continued.)
Who!
said she, eagerly. Who else is there, that
you would.
Nobody! said I, anticipating her question, while
her hand fell into her lap. Nobody else upon this
earth!---not even to him!---would I consent, that
How, answered Elizabeth---is my brother so
vain of his sister; or so
selfish?
Vain, if you please, child; and very selfish, as all
men are, of what is inestimable. Who is willing to
share his
only
jewelhis
last
drop of cold water, while
his lips are blackened with fever!---his wife---his
child?
Brother, brother!---that is wrong, said Elizabeth,
with a deep sigh.
I shall never be married
.
Her tone of voice went to my heart. It was utterly
unlike her manner on such occasions. There was less
of determination, than of grief, and despondency, and
strange hopelessness in it. Nay, her breath grew
thicker; and I thought that I felt a deeper throb at her
heart, where it leaned upon mine.
But why, said I; my dear girlwhy do I hear a
tone so disconsolate (her head drooped)from
Elizabeth
Adams, on such a subject. It is but looking
about you, sister; and you may have your choice of the
wisest, and best.
She raised her slender form, for a moment; put back
the silken luxuriance of her hair; and smiledsuch a
smile, as I never before saw upon her beautiful mouth.
There are godlike creatures, said she, with
fervour
;
but, in a low tone, and with a working lip, as if
vol. ii. X
she were communing with her own heartbut---a tear
fell upon my hand.
Then why do you not marry? said I, overcome
with my feeling. Why refuse Wilman? Why,
Larence
?
O, Elizabeth, I have been too selfish; I will
yield you to them---to either---to any body.
To
anybody!
brother.
Yea, to
anybody
you would not marry a man, that
I could be ashamed of.
Yes---but might I not choose some one, that you
could not love?
I hope not. I believe not(her head fell upon my
shoulder,) yet, nevertheless, dear, it were better that
there should be some one to protect you, when I am
away, or dead, or
Married
brother, she said, half smiling, half
pouting
,
while her voice trembled, like the melody of wet
harp strings.
Would that I could see you married, after all,
Elizabeth. I begin to be weary of this continual
sacrifice---I

sudden

my cheek)were you married, though your heart,
for a time, would feel widowed; yet a new being would

her whole frame---I could feel it in her throat, as if
she were strangling with confusion, and shame; aye,

shook in mine)---and dimpling fat hands, nestling about
the heart of my sister. What!offended, sister!---
surely the thought cannot be new to you; a woman of
your age, educated as you have been; qualified to
fulfil
every office of a wife, and a mother, with a
surpassing
tenderness, and simplicity---you cannot be
offended
,
dear.
No, brother, not offended, (said Elizabeth, with
a timid voice) not,
offended
, but sorrowful. I have
few notions of prudery; very few, I believe. I am able
to look, and speak, of the nursery, and of children;
without stammering, or blushing. Nay, more. I have
had a sweet dreaming, now and then---averse as I
have always been, to the perils of matrimonyabout
children of my own---naked little creatures; beautiful
as the day---innocent as beautiful; full of divinity;
radiant
all over with the infusion of our Father's love.
Yes, brother! and I have had to hush my heart, with
both hands, and all my strength---while I lay, and
wept, at the thought. And then, too, toiling as I have
been, all my life, for the improvement of my mind, and
temper; fitted, as I know that I am, for domestick
government
;
and capable, as I believe, that I am, like
most women, to endure privation and sorrow; pain and
agony, unspeakable, for the man that I loved, beyond
all that men can ever experience, or imagine; to think
of passing away an unprofitable life; having no one to
love me, in my old age; no husband, and no child to
be near to me, in calamity---to go down to my grave,
a worthless; nameless; unhonoured woman;---because I
have not been base enough to sell myself for some
price, less than
love;
to some mercenary wretch, for an
equipage---to some unnatural tyrant, for family
distinction
;
to some fool, for his beauty; or to
anybody
,
that I might escape the imputation of being an old
maid; as if to be a virgin, were to be something
shameful. When I have thought of these things,
brother
,
I cannot deny that I have wept, wept, bitterly;
and felt very heavy at the heartyet, still.
You are
determined
, then, said I, pressing her to
my bosom;
never to be married!
O, sister, how I
venerate
you. Yet do not think to impose upon me. I
know your motive.
What shook her so? By heaven, she grew as white as
a corpse. Nay, you cannot deny it, said I.
I will deny, nothing, said she, firmly---nothing,
which is true. What I have already said, I would not
have said to any other human being---if you
know
my
motive.
If!
said I---
if
I know it---why, surely, my
sweet Elizabeth cannot imagine, that her secret has
been so well kept, for so many years.
For so many years!said she, looking surprised.
No, I continued---no my sister. I feel, and
acknowledge
,
the sublimity of your love---: why do you
change colour? It is unheard of; and it were almost
unnatural for
me
to marry, and leave a sister, that lives
unmarried, for her love of me. No, Elizabeth, such
heroick be
The tears started into her eyes---my brother,
said she, wringing my hands, and wetting them with
her tears---my brother! I cannot deceive you---I
will not. Hear me---it must be told---I would not
willingly
give pain to you; but---I cannot endure to be
praised for virtues, that are not mineI
I was perfectly silent.
I, she continuedIit is not on
your
account,
that I do not marry.
On whose then? said I, abruptly---on whose
then
?---fool that I amI
Be calm, William, she replied, with great
dignity
,
and moderation. Be calm, for a moment; and
you shall hear; I will not keep the secret any longer.
Your violence does not intimidate me; but it distresses
me. Are you prepared?it will come upon you like a
thunderclap.
It is on account of Albert Hammond, the
Dwarf; that I do not marry
.
Righteous heaven! I cried, as soon as I could get
my breath. O! say not so!Elizabeth! Elizabeth!

my shut teethon all but

For the first time in all her life, there was a dash of
wicked scorn and bitterness, in her beautiful face; and
her eyes, too, streamed with passion.

That brought her to my bosom. No, brother, she
answered, sobbingno! I shall never marry him
never.
I was really comforted with the declaration; but
ashamed to appear so. What! I criedhe won't
marry you, I suppose; or he may love somebody else.
I believe, that he does, madman, she answered,
rising; and burying her face in her handsI believe,
that he does love another woman; for he has done all
but tell me so. Nay, I believe more, that, if I threw
myself into his arms, he would reject me.
Damnation, I cried, leaping upon my feet: this
is too bad!---refuse you!---
reject
you!---though I would
rather see you dead ten thousand times, dead, and
rotten, than in the arms of Albert Hammond, I would
cut his heart out of his bosomtear his tongueout by
the roots; and make him eat it, if he dared to

you.
She smiled, bitterly; contemptuously, I believe.
You!
she cried
you!
Why, William, he could hold
you still as death, with one hand; and bind you hand
and foot, with the other. What a madman you are!
So you would run to him, and cut his throat, for

to marry your sister. What a pretty figure, you
would cut! No, brotherbefore you set out on such
an errand, I will tell you the whole truth. I am not
yet, utterly dead to maiden modesty; and have never
told my love; nor sought his. Nay, morewould he
offer to marry me, this hour, I would refuse.
Refuse, said I
why!
---why, if you love him;
are you torturing me to death for pastime? Why
would you
not?
Why? Why would you
refuse?
She coloured to the very eyes, when she spoke,
Because, said sheI hold it to be sinful, to
transmit
disease, and deformity. I would neither marry,
nor be given in marriage, to one, whom You
understand
me, brother. Men are thoughtlesswomen
are more so. They marry with broken constitutions;
hereditary diseases; and unnatural, or vicious
propensities
;
entailing, thereby, upon their innocent offspring,
to the third and fourth generationall that is
loathsome
,
abhorrent, or disagreeablethus fulfilling,
literally
,
the denunciation, that heaven has pronounced
upon them that sin; nay, I do not doubt, that these are
the sentiments of Albert, himself. I say, that I do not
doubt
it: for, without seeking to
know
his thought upon
this subject, I know enough of his mind; and turn of
thinking, to feel very certain, that he is restrained
from thinking of marriage; not with me, for I do not
believe, that he loves me, but with another, and a far
more beautiful woman, by the same considerations. I
shall never marry
him
, brother, whatever may happen.
And for the sake of
him
, I will never marry another.
Will that satisfy you? Can you find any comfort
in it?
What could I say? All my dreams were dashed to
the earth, at once. What I most dreaded, yet never
dared to think of, had now come to pass. Elizabeth
loved Hammondand so did Ibut not, O heaven,
no!not as the husband of Elizabeth! the partner of
her bedthe father of her babes!O, no!My blood
curdled at the thought!
But worse than this; nay, not worse, but next to it,
in bitterness, and shame, was the discovery that I had
made; that her reason for not marrying, was not her
love to
me
but to another; and that otherO, my
brain whirled at the thoughtand I fell down giddy,
and sick, upon the floor.
CHAPTER XIII.
Emma...Atonement...Debate...Power of the states under the
constitution...Bills of credit...Bank paper...State charters
unconstitutional
.
I saw
Emma the following night; and told her, by
way of accounting for my stern and troubled look, all
that I could, without betraying the secret of my sister,
which concerned Hammond.
Her mild eyes darkened; and her hand, as I held it,
endeavouring, as usual, to keep my fingers upon the
pulse, grew suddenly cold. I pressed it---it was
passive---I
was half angry. I looked up, and there was a
suppressed agitation about her chaste mouth, as if her
very heart were in labour.
Emma, said I, as soon as I could speak; you
blame me, I feel that you do. What shall I say to
you? Do you upbraid me?
No,
no
, she replied, I cannot upbraid you, but
(she faltered) I am afraid that you do not fully
know Mr. Hammond. He is exceedingly your friend;
and, andpray, if the difference be not irreconcilable
pray
meet him,
as
a friend.
I pressed the hand of the dear pleader to my lips
Emma!---I will. I will see him tomorrow; and---
(I did not say what I would do; but I determined to
make an atonement equal to my offence.)
She mistook me, and threw a look of alarm at me,
as she saw me rise---do not go, yet---not yet---it is
not your hour. Her sister sat opposite to her; and I
would have given the world to be alone with her, for
one moment; and even to part less abruptly; but I
could not. I was impatient to retrieve my own good
opinion; and my impatience, to all but Emma, looked
like anger. Good night, madam! good night; good
night! said I, to the whole family, in a less, cordial
tone, I am sure, than usual, for I saw them recover
themselves, with rather more steadiness than common;
but when I came to Emma, I stopt; she put her hands
into mine; and, as I stood, with my back to the family,
I set my lips, fervently to her smooth, cold forehead,
to which the blood leaped, as to a wound; and
whispered
,
good night!
That same evening, I went to Hammond's room,
but he was away. I waited with impatience till
morning
;
but, when I had taken my breakfast, he was
already
in court. I went there---spoke to him; gave
him my hand; and he took it, much as usual;
but---perhaps
it was suspicion in me---I thought, with a
movement
of haughtiness about the mouth, that was not
common
.
I sat down; and was not a little astonished
soon after, when he addressed the court---at the
profound
attention with which he was listened to. His
language was that, which I had always heard him
recommend
;
precisely what he would have used in
conversation
;
yet, with this difference, that he talked
better
in conversation; nay, I never heard him
talk
so
badly, until he had fairly entered into the debate; and
then, I was carried long with him, by his bold,
distinct
,
vehement way, just as if he were in conversation.
I am an excellent stenographer yet; but
then
, I was
unrivalled
;
and, willing to pay him some compliment, (for
I had heard him often say, that he wondered how he
should argue in public; that he could not write, or
study
his language; that he felt a great concern upon the
subject; and that he should not be able, for years, to
enforce the same attention in court, that he did in
conversation
.)---I
employed myself in taking notes of his
speech. It was nearly as follows. After some
discussion
about the propriety of entering into the main
question, at once; it was permitted to the counsel, to
touch
upon it.
The court have been informed that this is a
motion
,
under rule, to shew cause upon a
quo warranto.
Without entering into a repetition of what has already
been said, I shall proceed, in the shortest and plainest
possible way, to reply to our antagonist; and enter at
once, briefly, upon the merits of the great question, in
support of the following propositions.
1. That no state of the union hath a right to
incorporate
a banking company, with authority to issue
bank paper.
2. That all such incorporations; and all acts done
in consequence thereof; and under the authority of the
same, since the present constitution of the United
States was adopted, are unconstitutional and void.
3. That this is the only legitimate mode of bringing
the question before the court.
The clause upon which I depend is this: art. 1. sec.
10. of the U. S. constitution
no state shall emit bills
of credit
.
In the first place, it will not be disputed that the
letter
of this constitution, shall always yield to the
spirit;
and that, when about to be interpreted, the common rules
of construction are to be regarded: the evil meant
to be remedied; and the
intention
of them, that
framed and adopted it. If these preliminaries are to
be disputed, I must stopfor the constitution, which
is not a code of laws, but a simple declaration of
what are considered fundamental principles, will
become
a dead letter.
What then was the
evil
to be provided against, by
the new constitution? It was thisone that had
blackened
and dishonoured the reputation of the whole
country
;
and had shaken the
confederacy
to its
foundation
.
Some of the states had issued their paper money,
till it was utterly worthless; thereby raising a revenue,
too secret for our jealous forefathers; and taxing their
neighbours in a manner too little likely to alarm them:
and dishonouring the whole coalition by their breach of
faith.
Look at the constitution. You see, with what
scrupulous
sagacity the great men that wrought it out,
have provided against an ascendency so dangerous.
They will not permit any state, to keep armies or
navies
in time of peace, without the consent of congress
.
Why? Because two or three of the maritime states;
and two or three of the inland ones would soon
become
armed rivals.
Neither would they permit, to any state, the power
of levying imposts. And why? Because that would
give a direct, and constantly accumulating
secret,
encroaching
ascendency to the importing states. It would
endanger the equality; if not the safety, of the whole
family. It would give them the power of taxing their
inland brethren, at pleasure.
But, at the same time, they do permit to each state,
the power of
direct
, open taxation; because they know
that
such
a power can never be dangerous, to a
thoughtful
and free people.
The evil then, is clear. The purpose and intention
of the framers were, of course, to prevent a repetition
of itto maintain the equality of the statesto
prevent
a secret, and dangerous, and constantly
augmenting
system of taxation; and, thereby, to keep down the
worst propensity of their nature; their appetite for
dominion.
But, say our opponentsthese
Bank bills
are not
Bills of credit
and are
not
emitted
by the state
.
What!are we to quibble, upon such a point as that!
What are
Bills of credit?
Are they not, any, and every
kind of circulating paper medium? Qualify them, as you
may, by one name and another; certificates
banknotes
bank
billstreasury notesor what you please;
all are
Bills of credit
. Because, they tend to obtain
credit
and
revenue; and, by their ultimate destruction,
loss, or depreciation, to tax a people, in the most
oppressive
,
though wasteful, and secret manner.
But, we are told that, they are not emitted
by
the
state! That is false. They
are
emitted
by
the state.
Qui facit per alia, facit per se
what is done by my
authority
,
is done by myself.
Is not a
tax
raised as securely, and as certainly?
first, by a
bonus
to the state, which is not paid by the
people at
first
, for that would stir up their hot blood,
to remonstranceand, secondly,
to
the incorporation,
by the peoplewhich thereby enriches the state, a
second
time.
Is there not the same danger of a breach of faith?
the same likelihood that more paper would be issued,
than could be redeemed? the same perilous ascendency
of the larger, and more powerful members, to be
guarded
against?
as if the Bills of credit were issued,
directly
,
from the state treasury
.
No. I am wrongit is not the same!it is ten
thousand times greater. A state has
some
reputation;
some
sense of justice; which, in the vicissitudes of
election
,
will appear at last; but Banking incorporations
I appeal to all our experience---are to be restrained in
their issues, only by destruction or inability. But
grant that each has the same
desire
, to inundate a
country
with bank paper---the state itself---and the
incorporations
established
by
the state. I would ask, which
of them has the most
power;
the most activity; the
greatest
number of agents and partisans?---nay, the greater
credit?
I answer, without hesitation, that the
latter
have. No state in the union, can issue, by her own
direct
authority,
directly from her own treasury
, so large
an amount, of bank paper, as two or three great
incorporations
can, when excited by a spirit of rivalry. And
why? Because the most ignorant man, among us, dreads
to have his remedy against a sovereign state; he would
prefer the note of many an individual, to the plighted
honour of a whole state. In the first place, he has a
short and certain remedy; against the state, a slow and
uncertain one.
But, be that as it may, there is yet a point, upon which
the subject may be rested for ever. On that, I depend.
It is maintained that a state, though she may not emit
bills
of credit,
directly
, from her own treasury, may
give an authority, (which it is acknowledged, that she,
herself does not possess) to others; whereby, they may
do, in effect, what
She
cannot do, provided that they will
change the name, from
Bills of credit
, to
Bank bills
, or
bank notes.
If this doctrine be sound, what will become of these
provisions? No state shall keep
ships
of war, in time
of peacewithout the consent of congress. No state
shall
coin money
.
Suppose that a state authorize
a company
of
individuals
,
to build and keep
sloops
of wargun boatsfire
shipsbomb ketches(but not
ships)
in times of peace,
without the consent of congress. Would it be right?
Would she have the power? There is no interference
with the
words
of the constitution. The
spirit
only, is
set at nought. Who has the hardihood to maintain
that
she may?
Yet, the principle is the same. If a
state may authorize an incorporation to issue paper
moneyshe may authorize the same incorporation to
build and
keep, in time of peace, without the consent of
congress
, all sorts of warlike, naval armament, except
ships
of war; nay, even
ships
of warif it be not an
infringement
of the constitution, to authorize another, to
do, what she cannot do herself.
So too, a state may constitute a privileged company
of men; and authorize
them
to
coin money
receiving a
share of the profits in advance, under the name of
bonus
;
and, when arraigned, put her hand, fearlessly
upon
the constitution; and say, that she has not
dishonoured
,
nor contemned it; that
she
has not coined money:
but only authorized others to
coin money
.
Naywhat is this,
but
coining money?---Stepping,
at once, into the throne of sovereignty; usurping, by
proxy
, the two of its chief attributes; the right of coining
money, and that of raising a revenue? Yet, more---the
evil is
greater
than that of coining money; for, in the
latter
case, the usurpation would be but of an unprofitable
attribute. There is little or no profit, in coinng money.
The general government, therefore, would lose much
less by it....and the people, as there
must
be some
intrinsick
value in the coin, could not be utterly
abused
;
or to such an extent, with money
coined
, by an
incorporation; as by
bills
emitted. The former would
always be worth something, for old metal.
Thus far, have I argued closely, from the
acknowledged
principles of the constitution. It abounds with
analogy. To that, I refer, without taking up the time
of the court. A few words more, and I have done.
It has been asked, why the states have been
permitted
,
so long, to enjoy this power, unquestioned, if it be
not a rightful one?I have been thought rash and
presumptuous
,
for daring to lift up my voice against such
Vol. ii. Y
venerable abuse. Call me rashI care not. Say that
I am presumptuous.I have lived long enough, not to be
afraid to speak the truth, any where; or, before any face;
and long enough, to give me confidence, when I came
here, in defiance of long usage; prescription; and
consecrated
abuse. I care nothing, for either. I know
the duty of this court; and, I call upon them, to
pronounce
a judgment, according to their oaths and
allegiance
.
I was about to leave the matter herebut, I see, on
glancing at my notes, one or two objections, to which
some answer, and mine shall be a very brief one
ought to be given.
It is said, that any
one
man may, under our
constitution
,
issue his note of hand; and then, it is asked, if
one
man may, why may not fifty; or one hundred; or a
thousand
?
It is said, too, that he may issue that note, in
just such shape, as he pleases; pictured and engraved,
if he will, like bank paper; merely printed like a check;
or written only, like a common promissory noteand
that it is the folly of the publick, if they receive it as
any thing more.
To which I reply, first---It is the duty of all
governments
to protect the people from manifest injury,
not only where they cannot, but where they
will
not
protect themselves. In the next place, one man, or a
dozen, or twenty, or a thousand,
may
sign a note of hand;
I admit that; and put it abroadbut mark the
consequence
.
He and they must all be liable, in
person and
property
, for the redemption and payment of the note.
There lies the secret. The legislature shall not
interfere
,
and trample all the law of contract, into the dust,
to protect any of them;and so long as they are not
protected, their issue
is
constitutional, because it is
nothing
more than a
partnership note
. But is that like
Bank paper, issued under state authority? NoThe
legislature
does
interfere there; and grant to one party,
protection and indemnity, against
all
law; and against
all
the principles of law; protecting the debtor, in
person and
property;
nay, even in reputation: for it is no longer
disgraceful to have been one of a swindling banking
companyfrom all the consequences of his madness or
folly.
In the next place, I maintain that the United States,
alone, have the right of issuing
paper money:
that even
congress
cannot
give that power to any individual state,
any more than it can, the right of
coining money
. The
prohibition is peremptory. There is no chance of
escape
.
It is not even left, as some things are, to
possibility
;
or, as in the case of
keeping ships of war
, to
the
consent
of congress.
I go one step further. I say now, that, if the
United
States have any paper currency abroad; not an
individual
has a right to print or engrave his own
simple
note of hand, so as to
resemble
that currency. He
has no right to
coin money
, so as to resemble the money
of the state. But, he has still the right to
coin money;
and
stamp it;
and issue notes of hand, in
any form
he pleases
, provided that, the unwary shall know, at
a glance, that it is
not
the coinage, or issue of the state
sovereignty. It is not enough that a minute
inspection
would discover the differencethe difference
must be broad, and sufficiently striking, to put a man
of common understanding upon inquiry.
Thusif a man should issue square pieces of gold
coin, with his name upon them; or his own notes of hand,
in the common fashion of such things, there would be
no danger to the publick; for no man would take either,
without proper inquiry and examination; and then, he
would take it, not on the faith of the country, but on
the faith of intrinsick value, or individual credit;and
he who coined the one, or issued the other, would not,
thereby, have subjected himself to the penalty, for
coining money
.
As for the method of bringing the question before the
courta
quo warranto
is it necessary to trouble the
court with the learning upon that point?
The court consulted together, for a moment; and then
told him to proceed. They were satisfied for the
present
,
about the nature and mode of applying the
remedy
.
(Hammond smiled, as if he wondered a little,
not only at their ready acquiescence; but, at their
permitting
the question to approach them in any shapein
the way that it
had
before they had fully settled the
question about
that
)I have now done, said he.
---I have now done. I have shown, I hope, all that I
set out to showthat this bank note, which I now
hold in my hand, has been issued under a void
authority
;
that it has been done too, against the whole spirit
and analogy of our constitution; in defiance of all the
penalties attached to an infringement of sovereignty,
here;
and that it is, in reality,
coining money
, in the
worst possible way; levying a tribute, in that way of
all others, most emphatically denounced by the
constitution
;
that it is, in short, a matter, upon which grave
men, the appointed judges of the land, whatever may
be their opinion of
him
, who has arisen to pluck down
the temple upon his headif his reasoning be sound,
must
unite with him to bring it down, though all of us
are stunned and blinded, with the thunder and dust of
its fall; or buried for ever in the ruins!
Here ended his speech; and the judges upon the
bench; venerable and sedate men, with countenances
full of awful wisdom and deep thought, remained, for
some minutes, in a profound silence; during which,
Hammond
passed out of court, like one assured and confident
of the result; and triumphing in his heart, that he had
turned the scorner to seriousness; and them that had
smiled upon him, in compassion, when he began, to a
tremendous reposea repose like that which settles
and weighs upon the spirit, when it looks upon the
great ocean, at midnightsilent and breathless in awe;
awaiting every wrathful movement; and like that,
with which great men look upon revolutions; or the
mustering of armies; or the preparation for political
earthquake and hurricane.

Marriage...Reflections thereon....Fashion of the time....Confession
....Elizabeth... Jealousy....Romping...Levity... Beware of
Mystery...Dreaming...Education...Apprehension...Love....
Consummation.
The
time of my marriage was now rapidly
approaching
;
and, as it came nearer and nearer to me; there
was an unaccountable heaviness upon my heart,
constantly
augmenting; a mournful, and rather pleasant
solemnity
;
a kind of depressing tenderness, that made
me weep, when I was all alone, without knowing why;
and kept me mute as love and death, when I was with
Emma. Yet, O, I could not have given up that gentle
sorrowing, for all the fierce riot of the imagination;
and all the frenzy and delirium of my past life. Now,
I felt that I loved, purely and tenderly; for my only
thought was for
her
happiness; my only tear that I
should not be all that
she
believed me to be. Tell
me, I would say, tell me, love, as soon as I could
recover myself sufficiently to command my voiceis
there
no
doubt upon your heart, Emma, none? no
question
that you would ask me, yet? I have told you all
my whole lifenoI am wrong, I have not told
you all.
She turned deadly paleand leaned, in her helpless,
faint sorrow, and alarm, for a moment, against my
bosom. How could I wonder!our separation, before,
had been owing to an unintentional concealmenta
little deceitbut no falsehoodon my part; and
now
, to imagine, that such an event might happen
againoh, no wonder that she turned palepoor
Emma!
No, dear Emma; I continued
no!
I have not
deceived you. You believe me at this moment, by my
own representation, rather worse than I am. What I
meant to say, was this. If there be
any
questionwhich
concerns only myself; and not the secret of another
ask itand the truth is
yours
. That is such
confidence
,
vol. ii. Y 2
as I askand no other. Nowas it shall be for
ever I will do, as I would be done by.
No: she replied, faintly, reassured in some
measure
but,
while we hold to this, would it not be well;
(she faltered, for she never pronounced my name,
when we were aloneshe trembled to be familiar; and
dreaded to appear formalso that she would neither
say
William;
nor Mr. Adams; and still less, what no
delicate woman will, in any case
Adams
, aloneit is
too masculine) totobe more heedful about
admitting
such confidence.
Certainlycertainly, dear; now that we know
each other; while our two hearts are so truly one, that
their very blood keeps time
(She plucked away her hand from mewith a slight
petulant, movement, that made me smile; for my
fingers
were upon her pulse.)
Togetherwe ought never
never
to admit a
confidential
communication from any human being, but
with the privilege of committing it to each other.
In no case? she replied, timidly.
In
no
case, loveperhaps a case
may
be imagined;
one of life, and death; but I cannot, at this moment,
suppose
any
situation capable of justifying a wife, or
husband, in receiving what neither
can
, under any
circumstances, communicate to the other. Is it
not so?
ReallyII
after
marriage, you know; (
colouring
,
and smiling, while her wet eyes danced
pleasantly
through her dark lasheslike revolving
jewelry
.
I love to compare things with one another.)
Yes, said Ithat
may
make a difference in our
lovenay, it will
Not in minenot in mine, I am sure(very
earnestly
.)
Yes, Emma, it willthe mystery, and
enchantment
,
of delusion, will be done with; a better,
more permanent, and holier feelinga deeper, and
more quietand less passionate love, will arise in our
breasts. We shall tremble less; and love more
inwardly
;
with a feeling of warmth, quiet, and comfort:
O, yes!we shall be dearer, infinitely dearer, then, to
each other, than we now imaginebut the feeling will
be unlike that, which now agitates us. You will have
done blushing, then.
I hope not, said she, affecting a little pettishness,
to conceal her beautiful confusion.
What! said I, pulling her to meis it so
pleasant
,
to blushor do you already anticipate an
occasion
for it?
She turned away her head; and pretended, for a
moment
,
to be adjusting her collar; but I saw the blood
rush into her fingers, till they were all of a
transparent
scarlet, almost as when a delicate hand is held,
open, with the fingers shut, before a candle.
No, said sheresuming a more serious manner
I have nothing to asknot a question. I have that
confidence in you, now, that I believe you would not
represent yourself
better
, than you are to me; such
confidence, as to
believe
, that, whatever is proper for
me to know, you will tell me; if not now, at some
future period; and that you do not distress me with the
painful, and revolting particulars, of your early
wandering
,
and transgression
not
, because you would
deceive
me;
not
, because you are
afraid
to tell me;
not
,
because you wish to conceal them from mebut
because
they are the secrets of others, more than of
yourself
;
and because(she faltered again)you would
not familiarize my thought with impurity, and
wickednesss
though
repented of.
While she was saying this, she hid her lovely face
in her hands; and her hair, of shadowy brown, fell,
gloriously dishevelled, over them; and I locked her to
my very heart, in rapturous delight, and pride.
Perhaps, said Ithere may be.
I understand you; she repliedyou are right.
There is one thing in your temper, which alarms me.
It is not what the world calls it; but it is a passion that
makes me tremble.
And what does the world call it?
Jealousy
ah! your lips turn white.
Jealousy!
I replied, affecting to laughno---oh,
no, Emma, I am not---I I, stopped; was I not
selfish?---suspicious?---envious?---and do not
they
make
a compound, quite as terrible as jealousy?and very
likely to be mistaken for it? Others had called me
jealous---might
it not be true?
But what do
you
thinkEmma?
To deal frankly with you, then, said she, putting
her hand upon my arm; as it lay over the chairI
have no fear that you will ever be
jealous
of meof
my---what shall I say? I know that a certain degree
of apprehensiveness is always the attendant upon true
love; that we are only without that delicate alarm,
and anxiety, where we do
not
love; and that, in
proportion
as any object is dear to us, is our perpetual terrour
of losing, or sharing it; that is our whole nature. I
mean to say, then---but here is Elizabeth!---she shall
say it; she knows your temper, better than I
Elizabeth had opened the door softly; and now
stood, leaning over Emma, with full eyes, dancing in
their brightness; and bosom beating high, and
beautifully
,
from the exercise of walking.
Ah!brother!
brother!
she exclaimed`
anticipating
,
are you!and ah,
sister
bless me, don't blush,
dearI was only about telling you, that I would not
if I were you, Emma, dear, put up with any of his
admonition
,
until I,
could not help myself
.
Come!come! young lady, said I, pulling her into
my lapno compassing the king's death hereby
construction;no treasonno rebellion. But you have
come in good time; we are discussing a grave matter.
Am I of a jealous temper?or am I not?
Are you serious, brother?
Serious!yes---
am
---Ijealous!---speak plainly---

Nay, nay, brotherdon't trouble yourself about
what she
believes:
she
knows
you better than any of us;

let me speak to you, but you colour all over. What has
happened? I shall begin to imagine, that Brother!
look at mehave you been whipping her?
Nay, Elizabethspeak to the question. Am I
jealous?
Yes
, she replied; starting upon her feet; and
laying
down her hands upon a great bookyou are
indeedupon my veracity, you are
I was a little hurt.
Selfish
too, I suppose, said I.
She nodded.
Suspicious
?
Yes
, dearany more questions?
No, I thank you!Why, What a mischievous
wench it is! said I, not a little nettled though, at her
plain dealing.
Come, come brother, don't get huffy about it.
Your
jealousy
, as Emma, knows is like yourself; the
greatest oddity in the world.
We
call it jealousy, for
the want of a better name; and because it is more like
that passion, than any other. It grows, I do not like
to flatter youit grows out of your self-distrust. Nay;
don't sparkle so, at the eyesyou are vain enough, on
all other subjects; but, where you love, a sense of your
own unworthinessha! ha! ha!isn't that frank?--keeps
you in perpetual hot water: and then you never give a
fellow an opportunity for explanation; but, up you
jump, and bounce off, as if you were full of congreve
rockets.
Emma laughed outright--and shook her head at
her.
Now, said I, to Emma:---may I be parboiled---
heart---and all---if you haven't been telling tales out
o' school, young woman.
Guilty! guilty! cried Elizabeth. Now for a
confession! Help me, Emma,help me! Don't stand
there; shivering, like a moonstruck creature. Now is
your time! If you mean to keep your ascendency, you
must establish it in season. Bring him downdown
to the dust, with him!
Out upon thee, witch! I cried, will nothing
content
thee. Spiriting up my sub.
Your
subjects!
there! you see what you are coming
to. After marriage, he would'nt have clipped that
word, you may depend on it. If he had not been sure of
younowhe would have swallowed the
first
syllable,
as well as the lastbad symptoms, Emma.
Hush, hush, I cried, I do plead guilty. Why,
what the deuce possesses the girlare you mad?
Yes! leave me be!
This was said in a manner so irresistibly happy
reminding
me of one of my own snappish answers, that
they both joined anew, in a hearty laugh.
By Jupiter! said I, girls! rebels! you will carry
a fine hand over me, one of these days, if I do not put
a stop to it, at once. I can feel my throne totterthe
jewels blowing away, like dust from my forehead.
Very pretty indeed!was'nt that Emma?
Very, said Emma.
Come, be serious, will yousit down, for a moment;
and then we will all take a walk together. Do you
believe, (my tone was very serious; for I began to feel
a deeper concern, than I was willing to confess)do
you believe, that Emma has any thing to fear, from this
jealousy
of mine?
Elizabeth looked at me, till her eyes filled, before she
replied; and then, pressing my hand, and Emma's
together
.Yes,
brother
yes!
more than from any
thing else; nay, more than from
every thing
else, in all
this world. I will answer for every thing elsefor
your love, honour, tenderness, fidelity and kindness; but
for that
that
, there is only one hope! You must watch
and pray, Emmaand
you
, for yourself, brother.
Emma, your hand trembles. Do not believe that he
will ever wrong you, Emma. No, he will notin
thought, word, or deed.
Do not believe that he will ever doubt your
truth;
or your
principles
no, he will not; but, for a moment
hear me brother! hear me! my blessed, sweet girl,
whom I hope to see the wife of my brotherhear me!
I hope never again to speak of itI have waited, too,
for a long time: and, though I have trembled at the
thought of it; and put it off, many, and many a day,
when it has been upon my very lips, yet I am now
glad, that an opportunity has arrivedfor a moment,
dear, he may doubt your
love
. O, do not weep so
bitterly
,
EmmaI only say, that it is possible---
possible
,
dear---the thing may never happen---nay, will never
happen, as I am persuaded; but, still, I would have you
know the worst, and be prepared for it. Have no
reserve with him. Do not wait to be asked. He will
never ask you a question, if he once begin to doubt
you will not be able to know what he thinks, unless
you speak to
him
, of it. You will find his jealousy,
then, to be unlike any that you have ever heard of. His
manner will be more tender; delicate; assiduous, but
thoughtful; perhaps, even sorrowful. He will never
watch youno---and should he believe that your heart
faltered for another---you will only know whom it is,
by the double portion of his confidence, and kindness,
that will be lavished upon that other. Speak
then
---
speak, quickly, Emma---or my brother will be gone for
ever! Have no mystery in your conduct. Do not
wait to be told by him, that mystery is wrong. Be,
for ever, as it is your nature to be, frank and
communicative
,
with him. Believe nobody---
nobody!
---that
would preface his tale by any hint of concealment---
do this, and you will be happy beyond the lot of
women
.
But fail---O, EmmaI know his temper---his
extravagant exaltation of sentiment---he would die, of
a broken heart; away from you---far---far away---and
you
would die a widowed creature---without having
heard one word of reproach, or upbraiding. Brother!
---do not weep---yes, yes!---weep, weep together!---I
will leave you. The truth is now told. My heart is
unloaded---and I will now leave you, together.
Neither of us could detain her. I felt poor Emma's
heart beating hurriedly, and irregularly, against my
arm, where it encompassed her waist---for many
minutes
after Elizabeth, had gone.
There was a melancholy silence for some time.
You tremble dear, said I---but not with
apprehension
,
I hope?
Indeed, she answered, faintlyit
is
with
apprehension
.
I am not afraid of myself. I do not fear
that I shall ever deserve to suffer; in the way that
Elizabeth has mentioned---but---circumstances
accident---and
you are
so
impetuous---so
heroick
, I should
call it, were it not, an unnatural violence, and
elevation
,
too intemperate for any woman's happiness---
that you might break my heart---without---nay die,
yourself, of a broken heart---without giving me an
opportunity
for explanation.
Never!
said I, firmly---
never!
We have already
suffered enough, to teach
me
wisdom, on that score.
No---Emma, whatever happen, as I have said, many a
time before, you shall always have an
opportunity
for explanation.
She carried my hand, convulsively, to her lips.
What startled me!---what was it, then---that shot, like
a cold adder, through all my heart! I know not---I---
I; but there was a something in her manner, too eager,
too grateful---and abrupt, as if my promise were more
important to her, than it ought to have beenwhich
set me thinking
Let me pass over the rest of our courtship
preparation
and marriage. Enough, to say that we
were
marriedas I always determined to bewithout
romping
or festivity---with no mob about us; and, almost
alonefeeling, at our hearts, that it was a religious
celebrationupon which, to trifle was blindness, and
deep infatuation. For my part, I can only say, that
my sensations were awfulmore so, I verily believe,
than, if I had been called up, to receive the judgment
of death. Not, that I did'nt love herO heaven! with
all my heart and soul. But, we had thought, until our
hearts were heavy, of the deep accountability, into
which we were about to enter. It was not my
happiness
alone, that was at stake; mine alone, here and
hereafterbut, it was
hershers!
and, perhaps, of
other immortal creatures, to be born of our love,
nourished
in our endearment; and leftO, righteous heaven!
helpless and dependantbeset by temptation and
trial
undiciplined,
unsustained. Man, man!hast thou
a heart; and canst thou step, with a firm, and a high
heart, unpreparedly, into a charge, so awful!
Woman
,
woman! canst thou!is nursing angels, angels
that thou art to meet hereafter, in heaven, so light a
matter, that thou wilt not even look serious, or devout,
at the moment of passing the threshold of such a
fearful
duty. By heaven! it ought to bow thee down, with
consternation and tears! Do you believe, that I saw no
comfortno blessedness in the future! O, ye are
strangers
to the heart of a thoughtful man, if you believe,
while it is fullest and heaviest, that there are no pleasant
sources of consolation in it; no sweet, inward fountain
rippling, with life blood in itlike sap through the
trodden leaf. Nowhen I held her to my heart; my
own, my wedded wife; while our tears ran down, like
rain, upon her white dress; and she sobbed upon my
bosom, and trembled, all over, as if her dear heart
would breakwhile the few that were near, stood
around, with amazementas if there were something
ominous in such sorrow;yet, even then, there was
the stirring of nature within us; our hearts yearned, to
be yet nearer to each otherand their incessant pulse
and palpitation, were but the beautiful alarum of
unspeakable
tendernessand delicate, bashful,
anticipation
.
Even then
then!
I grew dizzyand felt a
strangling
sensation in my throata sudden darkness
followed
and
then, I saw my own boy at her bosom
as plainly as I can see this paper. I felt his little
hands, playing about my lips; and when, a weary year
afterward, we were standing together, at a window;
she, holding her new born babe in her armsby heaven!
just in the very spotas she was leaning upon my
bosom
it
all flashed upon me at once, and I told her of
the vision, that I had at our weddingwhile she hid
her modest, blushing face in her great shawl.
And then;but noI must not hurry with such
rapidity
to the precipice. My brain may become
giddy
,
if I doand I shall not have the force to finish,
what I ought to tell.
I would speak, for a moment, of our past trials. All
newly married people have them. Prepare themselves,
as they will, there will be
some
disappointment;
some
difference, between the realities of marriage, and their
visionary anticipations. Ours were temperate,
guardedly
so; and, we soon found the advantage of it; for,
each became dearer, and dearer, every moment, to the
other, for having practised no deception, either on
ourselves; or on each other.
vol. ii. Z
We saw little company; for, our resources would
not permit it; and, none at all, for the first month of our
marriage. Our sentiments were alike, upon that subject;
my wife was no more willing to be exhibited to a
parcel
of impudent coxcombs, whether
in
petticoats, or
out;
or still more impudent women, the day after our
marriage
,
than I was, to exhibit her. No!if there ever be
a time, when all the tenderness, and delicacy, and
holiness
of
retired
love, are most wanted, for the
consolation
of womanwhen privacy, and silence, and
loveliness
are most welcome, it is in that hour of renewed
being
,
when, all at once, the girl has been touched, and
transformed into a woman. Yet, at this time, in the
accursed
depravity of the age; the gross indelicacy of
fashion; women, who are ready to faint with terrour and
shame, and confusion, are put up, pale, and trembling,
like breeding cattle, at a fair, to be criticised, by all the
town.Faugh!
REMARKS ON EDUCATION.
My dear EmmaI am alone. How I shall get
through the night, I know not---unless I pass it, in
writing
to you.
I would have the education of a child begin, with its
birth. My first attention should be directed to the
development
of his physical properties; for, so intimate is
the sympathy between the mind and body, that each
will always participate in the suffering of the other,
exactly in proportion to its own delicacy and feebleness.
A sound constitution of body; firm and hardy, though
not a robust habit, being formed, I would begin to
lay the foundation of intellectual
character
. The
materials
,
I might have been collecting, before; the
stature
and proportion of the creature, that I meant to
train up, for a good and great man, might have been
contemplated, again and again; while its corporeal
energies
were moulding themselves into beauty and strength
but, I would never touch the
mind;
whatever I did, with
the
morals;
other than, as if by accident; never, by any
approach to system, until the body were, in a measure,
complete. From very infancy, I would have, now and
then, a deep lesson written upon his heart; but, never, a
studied one; never one, that would require much
thought
,
in the child; and, my system of education for the
mind
,
should not begin, in general, before ten; and never, in
any case, so far as my experience among children, has
gone, before seven.
I speak of the
mind
, now, love. But, the heart, and
temper, I would put in training, from the first hour of
a child's birth. My first aim should be, to subdue that
fretful, impatient, peevish, petulant nature, so common
to all children. I would deal plainly. If I said
no
, to
the prayer of a child, I would persist in the denial,
though I should be sorry that I had said
no
, at first. Why?
Because, if I yielded, he would lose a portion of his
respect for me; and I should be pestered for ever, with
prayer and entreaty, if I were once to revoke my own
law. This, I would do, for a long time, until the
child were able to endure an errour of judgment in me;
without losing either his love or veneration for me,
but when it was no longer necessary for
my
authority,
that I should be held
infallible
in his eyes, I would
change my course.
The
first
indication of ill temper, the very
first
, I
would treat with immediate severity. But I would
require
the most conclusive evidence that it
was
ill
temper
.
It might be pain; it might be sickness; but, if I
were once
satisfied
, that the crying of a babe, though it
were not a week old, proceeded from ill temper, I would
make it smart for it, immediately. Women would call
this barbarous. A mother would go distracted,
probably
;but,
if she were a wife of mineif she
resembled
my wife---she would never interfere at such a
moment
,
though her heart ran blood. When we were
aloneI would listen to her; and, though I might not
love my babe as doatingly, or as tenderly as she, yet I
should not fail to convince her that I loved it as
strongly
;
and that I would probably endure more, for its
happiness
and health. Why? Because, till it were
capable
of feeling an heroick nature lit up within its heart,
I should often be compelled to appeal to its little
senses
alone, though
my
heart bled, as I did so. I should ay
---if a child be old enough to betray an evil temper, is
is old enough to be punished for it. A puppy or a
kitten
,
before its eyes are open, may be taught not to
repeat
certain things. And will you presume that the
young of a woman, have less capability.
O, it would be so cruel! say the kind of heart. How
can the little creature know
why
it is punished?
It does not know
why
. It need not. But, it is your
duty to associate the idea of
pain
, with certain acts; and
that of pleasure, with certain others, the first moment
that it is possible. A burnt child dreads the fire. An
infant will not readily touch a candle, that has once
burnt him; or a kitten, that has once scratched him, a
second time.
Do not forget this principle
. It is merely
planted, like a flower, in the youngest heart, as an
indication
of the soil. Apply it. If a child should cry
from ill temper; and experience the
same pain
, that it
did, from playing with the flame of the candle; or the
claws of the kitten, would it cry as readily a second
time? No. Nature gives the hint. Let us profit
by it.
You will bear in mind, that I do not pretend to teach
an
infant
the difference between
moral
right and wrong.
That would be faulty, indeed. But, for want of
properly
considering the subject, there are many, who would
ridicule, or reprobate my system; they will ask me,
how a child
can
be taught what is right; and what is
wrong, before it can reason.
To this I answerjust as a blind puppy can benot
by
reason
, but by being made to
feel
, that certain acts
are followed by pain; and certain other acts, by
pleasure
.
Neither is taught
morality
.
I do not mean to make either
understand
the
connection
between causes and effects. I only aim to make
them
feel
it. It is God's system of education, that I
would adopt. It is instinct and sensation; not
reason
,
that I apply to. What keeps the babe from eating
serpents
?or
gnawing its own fingers?---or pulling out
its own eyes? Sensation and instinct What teaches
the little mouse to hide, with its glimmering eyes, at the
purring of the young kitten? The swallow, to separate
the head from the worm, before she feeds her young with
it? The puppy to cower, when you lift your arm, or
stoop, as if to pick up a stone? The chickens, born in the
same nest, to keep away from the water, where the
ducks are paddling? Instinct and sensation. A little
experience suffices for a brute; without any knowledge
of
right
or
wrong
. He never forgets the hand that has
tortured him; the animal, that has worried him; and can
we expect less of a babe? I hope not. I do not. I have
known cases in confirmation.
Tell me, Emma---why does the dumb animal crouch
before the uplifted hand? Nay, before the menacing eye
of a stranger?
That
is not instinct. Is it sensation?---
It is a compound of sensation and memory. Both are
necessary. Have not our children faculties like these?
As soon as the babe could articulate a cry, I would
begin with teaching him, that, though he cried his little
heart out, except from pain or sickness, he should be
unheeded
.
I would never give a child any thing, sick or
well, for which it cried. This would be one of the most
difficult rules to observe---for, when there was any
doubt, I would always lean to the belief, that the
wailing
of my babe was that of nature, in pain or sickness;
and not, in mere ill humour. Once
satisfied
, however,
that it was
ill
temper, though it cost my child its life;
and me, mine own---I would not yield. It should learn,
that the sure way
not
to get a thing, if it were a matter
of mere pleasure; and not of health or necessity, would
be to cry for it:---and that, even when necessary to it,
crying was no acceptable or profitable mode of
persuasion
.
My next lesson would be that it should
never tell a
lie
. I would permit it to be silent. But I would say,
never tell a falsehood, never, never!---in look, word or
deed, though it be to save your life, and the lives of all
that you love. This should be continually repeated.
I would not
begin
with tempting him; but, in time, I
would tempt him, even with pain and humiliation. He
might fail, once perhaps, or twice; but, in the end, I
should prevail. But, if he did wrong, whether
intentionally
;
vol. ii. Z 2
or, from carelessness, I would not allow him to
believe that a candid confession, of his fault, was an
atonement
for it. No---he should suffer:---but not so
much
as if he had concealed it; and less, than if he had tried
to conceal it. Nay, I would never permit him to think
it possible for a child to lie, and live---if it were
not, that such a sublime mystery, would soon be derided,
by even a child. He would see, and hear, and feel lies;
and I could not conceal that such things were. But
though I could not conceal it, I would teach him that a
liar was a fool, and a coward. But if he
did
lie, I would
never let him know that I suspected it, till I was
certain
of it. At first, he should not be permitted to imagine
that he could lie without my knowing it;and, as that
wore away; for experience would soon convince him of
that errour, so far as I was concerned; I would make
him ashamed of the very thought, as of something
inconceivably
mean and dastardly.
At a very early age, if he had any sensibility, I
should abandon all the common modes of coercion. A
blow, I should teach him, was not to be born;
wherever struck, or by whomnever forgotten, or
forgiven
.
But
first
, I would teach him never to deserve
it. After the age of four, I should never strike him.
Nor would I, at any time, were it possible, by
confinement
,
shame, or some interdiction of food, to make him
feel, that
pain
was a necessary consequence of
misconduct
.
That is the great secret. Children, like
men, should never be permitted to think of
pain
, but as
a consequence of guilt, or misconduct;of guilt, but as
of something that would be inevitably followed by pain.
This association should always exist. Destroy it; and
you destroy the man. Destroy it, and you destroy
society
.
I would next teach him to keep a secret. No matter
how he obtained it; or from whom: or, under what
circumstances
:--having
been once admitted to the confidence
of any creature; evil or good, I would teach him
that it were better to die, than betray it. This would
be a simple, but severe lesson; and, in time, I should
qualify it, by mentioning the necessity of discretion in
the choice of associates, and the imprudence and folly of
such confidence.
I would then teach him to bear pain; to think of
death, as a matter of little moment.O, God! how
earnestly would I inculcate that doctrine; of
dishonour
,
as immeasurably worse; and that cowardice
was the greatest of dishonour. Still, I would inculcate,
that a quarrelsome; rash; arrogant manner,
was
, next
to cowardice, (the cloak of which, it often is,) the
greatest of dishonour, short of cowardice.
Take care, I would say, never to
give
a blow,
unless
it be well merited; and never to receive one,
without
returning it, though it be from a giantin church;
merited, or unmerited. Yet, beware how you obtain
the character of a bully---or a quarrelsome boy. Be
patient, kind, forgiving; ready to assist all your
playmates
in any peril,
right, or wrong
, at the hazard of
your life; for if they are in peril,
that
is no time to
abandon them; still less to admonish them;and let
them understand, at once, and for ever, that you will
forgive any thing, but a blow.
You may not be as strong, or as wise, as another;
nor so tall; nor so handsome; but you may always be
as brave. I could bear to see you turn pale as death,
at the very moment, when you struck another; but I
would never forgive youif you did it, without
emotion
.
He is the truly brave man, who
fears
most; yet,
does his duty, notwithstanding; and I have seen a
fellow
with a par-boiled face, so weak, that he could
hardly
keep his seat in the saddleand the sweat fell like a
shower from his forehead; and his feet rattled in the
stirrups; under whom, I would rather go into a
desperate
battle, than under others, that I have known, to
whom death, and blood, seemed to be matters of
indifference
.
The former was
intellectually;
the latter,
physically
braveone was a constitutional; the other
spiritual courage: one, the heroism of bones and
blood, and insensibility to danger; the other, that of
the heart, and a sense of reputation.
When I was a boy; before I knew what heroism
meant, I was struck by a little fellow. I was ashamed
to return it, upon him;---but, there was a larger boy
standing byhe was a new scholarI did not even
know his name. I went up to him, with my blood
beating
he
was the largest boy in sight---and gave him a
blow in the face. I was severely beaten for it. But
no boy of that school ever quarrelled with me,
afterward
.
I was naturally a cowardyet, on that
occasion
,
I was a
hero
.
The same spirit stood with me. When I was
eighteen
,
I insulted a middle aged, respectable man,
very cruelly. A quarrel ensued. He said some
bitter
things. A few days afterward, we met again. I
begged his pardon; but, before the words were out of my
lips, his manner was so provoking, that I knocked
him down. He thought that I was doing from
fear
,
what I did only from shame. He insulted me; and I
punished him on the spot. There, I behaved like a
desperate
cowardrather than like a hero.
Now, I should do differently. I have learnt to forgive
every thing in this world, but a blow: and
that
, I never
will forgive. I take care to make this known, that no
man who has a disposition to quarrel with me, may be
ignorant of the stake.
A child may soon be taught all these thingsand you
may then lay the foundation of his moral greatness.
Does he manifest a partiality for any particular
amusement
?
Do not be so foolishI am addressing all
parentsnot you, my belovedas to believe that he
has a
genius
for that. Human creatures are born now,
as they were five thousand years ago; and it is
ridiculous
to suppose, because a child builds card houses;
plays with powder, or types, that he has a genius for
architecture, war, or literature. What became of
children
,
that were born with a genius for literature; or
painting; or musick; or printing, before the invention
of either? Does God supply our children with a genius,
fitted to the discoveries and inventions of men, who
are not to be born for centuries, and centuries, after they
are dead. If so, it is probable that Fulton's alphabet
may be traced, to his having scalded himself, some time
or other, with the steam of a tea-potand that of
Franklin
,
to a practice of stroking back the hair of cats, in
a dark entryor some other, equally rational, or
philosophical pastime.
No---do not believe in these manifestations of the
Divinity. Look to the boy's face; movements; habits,
and mind; and if you discover that he won't do for any
thing else; do not make a parson, or a lawyer of him, as
people commonly do, in a large and fashionable family.
Be assured that it is the effectual way of making a
worthless
metal, yet more base. Do not teach the boy to
speak pieces;---leave him unrestrained, even in
company
,
to sit pretty much as he pleases. And not, as I
have seen some men, and good men too, keep up such a
cruel and intolerable system of observation, over the
child, that it has no comfort of its lifeand flies any
where for reliefto the kitchen, rather than to the
parlour---to
anybody on earth, rather than to his own
father
.
If you see any propensity to
imitation
, check it at
once. Yet, if you find only enough of it, to render it
evident that the child is not conscious of imitation,
cultivate
that
. That is not debasing. Of course, I speak
only of manner and action, and voice here, and such too,
as are worth a little of our study.
God has implanted within all of us, a burning
sensibility
to dishonour, and outrage. It is right, therefore,
that we should be angry, on fitting occasions; for they
will
occur; and it is right, also, that the feeling of
resentment
,
which is given to us, that we may not be
trodden under foot by the arrogant, should be sometimes
manifested:---but it is a base, cowardly spirit, that
becomes
tempestuous in its wrath, or noisy, in its anger.
Let it be deep, solemn, mild, sorrowful, and determined.
Then, too; if you must
punish;
your punishment will
bear the aspect of justice; not of
revenge
. Away with
revenge. It is brutal, bloody. The very beasts do not
feel that passion. But by this, I do not mean that you
are to forgive your enemy, till he be under your feet;---
or forget his indignity, until, in the language of
scripture
(for they understood such things well, at that time)
until you have heaped
burning coals
upon his head.
If you do not strike the insulter dead, at your feet,
while the blood of your heart is all in a foam; and all
your veins are distended to agony, with the heat that
he has raised---never pursue him, never! for his blood
but merely that you may bury him alive in hot
embers
.
That is all---and you have scripture for that.
Make him
feel
, that he is in your power; and then,
forgive
him. Do not even ask him to acknowledge it.---
It is enough for you, that he
sees
your chariot wheels,
about to roll over him; the armed hoofs of your chargers
about to leap into his bosom---then, you will turn them
both aside.
Whatever you promise to a child, good or bad, that
do
you. Keep your promises with it, be they wise or
foolish. This will make him respect you; and teach
you
caution in future.
If there be two of you, never interfere with each
other. No matter how wrong the wife is, at the time;
let the husband never interfere. No matter how
preposterous
and violent is the husband; let the wife
forbear
all entreaty and remonstrance, till the children
are sent away.
Never speak to a child, in a passion---still less, strike
it. But beware how you punish it, with a pleasant
countenance. That is the cruellest tyranny. Let your
front be steady; and your manner
that
, which he never
sees, unless he have done wrong.
Begin to treat him like a man, as soon as possible;
not by reasoning with him; or by encouraging him to
smartness; for few things are so detestable as your
smart men and women, except it be smart children;---
but, by addressing yourself to his understanding, in
matters
of simplicity and plainness; and by showing him
that you have confidence in him; and by expecting him
to do, what your experience convinces you, that he is
able to do.
Let your punishment be proportioned to his faults,
with great nicety; but never punish him,
never
, unless
you have the fullest evidence of the fault; for that
connexion
once broken, between misconduct and
mortification
;
guilt and pain;---he will begin to lose his
reverence
for you. It is better to be blind---than to see
wrong. It is better to overlook two certain offences,
than punish your child
once
, for a fault that he did not
commit. The evil effects are many. If you cannot
learn the truth in one case, you cannot in another;---he
will say; and, in the end, will probably cheat you into a
notion, that he is better than he is, merely because you
have let him know, that you have once thought him
worse than he was. In short---when you have once
punished a child, for a fault, of which he was innocent,
you have given the death blow to his belief in your
infallibility
.
You have taught him that you do not
know
when he is guilty---or, that you are wicked and unjust;
---and that it is the same thing to
him
, whether he be
innocent
or guilty. Beware of that lesson. He will
never forget it.
Nourish in him a high sense of honour. Teach him
to regard any withdrawing of your confidence and
respect
,
as the most grievous punishment. Accustom
him to reposing all his little sorrow, and humiliation,
and discouragement, in your bosom. Be temperate;
and
uniform
, above all things.
Never permit him to weep. Let him understand, that
that is unmanly, in
every
case; but disgraceful, to the
last degree, to weep from bodily pain, or terrour.
Would you stimulate him in his studies? Teach him
to regard them as a privilege. Should he play truant?
Forbid him to go to school for a month. A longer time
might reconcile him to the punishment; and enable
him to find new pastimes, and new companions.
Would you have him go to church?---fond of his Bible?
If he be a bad boy, prohibit his entrance to the one,
and his reading of the other, for awhile. If good, go
with him to church: not in fine clothes---but poorly
clad; with the privilege of giving away his superfluity
to the poor, with his own hand. Do not, if he be a
bad boy, set him to committing a hymn; or reading a
chapter in the Bible; for it is the sure way, to make
him hate them both. Such associations are destructive
to our reverence for both. Hence is it, that we have
so little true relish for the simplicity and beauty of
Scripture; and for many of the richest specimens of
eloquence in the classicks. They are constantly
associated
in our minds, with the recollection of our
school-tasks; labour; coarse familiarity; and
punishment
.
Neither should ever be seen in a school.
So with every other study. By a judicious and
unwearied
perseverance, you may bring a child, as you
may a man, to any habit of application, as to his food
and rest. Create
a habit;
and you give him a
continually
augmenting impulse; an impulse, too, that is
irresistible
,
exactly in proportion to the difficulty there
was, at first, in forming the habit.
Would you have him a lawyer? Do not name him
after Mansfield, or Parsons, or Kent, or Erskine.
Such things only make his first attempts, in life, a
matter of ridicule. Do not put him up in a chair, to
recite awkward verse, with a gesture, like the
clockwork
,
that you see annually wound up, and exhibited,
at Cambridge University; creatures cunningly put
together
:
automata, that raise first one clumsy arm, and
then the other, as natural as life, at every other
sentence
.
Would you make a minister of the gospel of him?
Teach him that he is to be God's vicegerent. Carry
him to see Mr. A. Show him why
that
man is
disqualified
.
He wants authorityvoicedignity
action
.
To Mr. B. His pronunciation is detestable; his
whine execrable. Your nerves are jarred to death, by
his barbarisms. Strange that men will be above such
little
things, as correct pronunciation, and clean teeth;
when they know, that the best discoursethe most
overpowering eloquencelose their effect for awhile,
if our ears be made to tingle with a provincialism. We
cannot attend to the reasoning, where we are fretted
with the sound; the meaning of a sentence is lost, if
we are made to swallow it, word for word. To Mr.
C. He is of the Boston school of Unitarians:
ninety-nine
out of one hundred, of whom, are the servile
imitators
of a young, ambitious fellow, there, who
happened
to be coaxed into the desk, when he ought to have
been harnessed for the field;or sent abroad on any
mission but one of Christ and
conversion
[14]
[14]
ConversionQuere de hoc.
Does the author use the word in a
religious, or legal sense? In the latter, I dare sayfor nothing else
would account for the zeal, and eagerness, and success, of some
missionaries
in conversion.
Ed.
all have his
dainty action, and melifluous cadenceand sickening
affectation. Bid your boy avoid that example, as he
would chanting in the pulpit. Take him to Mr. D,
he is of the orthodox tuneAndoveror Princeton
look at his armshis handswatch him, when he
meditates the pathetick. What on earth can be so
ridiculous
?
Nothing, except his attempt at eloquence and
storm. Why does he gesticulate? Why!not
because
he
feels;
not because, there is any sympathy
between
the vessels of his heart, and those of his limbs:
not because there is any illustration in their movement
for his manner and action; and voice and tone; and
look and language, are perpetually at war. It is Cicero
speaking---and Roscius acting---but then, you must
suppose that each has a different piece; or that one is
deaf and the other blind---or, you have no faithful idea
of his gesture. But why does he use it? Because he
has heard that, where he preaches, for a man to stand
in the pulpit like a skewered turkey, is to be, not
exactly
the thing.---So he takes the hint, unskewers
his
arms; and flourishes them about, like a telegraph---
cramped---in a high wind---or, as the turkey might, if
it should try to fly, after it was unskewered.
Having taught him this---that action is not to be
learnt by a diagram in the American Preceptor;
nor by the attitude of any
actor
, in any situation---take
him to see what hypocrisy and villany are. Show to
him a minister of the Most High---breathing fire and
smoke into the hearts of men; and pollution into that
of every woman, that he meets---a minister, arraigned,
accused; but braving it out; and the women
defending
him. Why?
Mistaken creatures! They are mothers and wives;
irreproachable, it may be, for aught but their
blindness
and infatuation toward their pastor, who should
be burnt to death; scourged to the bone, in the publick
vol. ii. A a
market place, by their husbands and fathers; and
crucified
to death, for the desolation, that he hath wrought
in many a family of love; for the undying reproach,
that he hath thrown upon the ministry of God---yet
they adhere to him, till he repeat his offence---the
scoundrel, lest, by abandoning him, they should seem
to admit him to be guilty,
him
, who was the companion
of their sick chamber, and death bed;---the only
unprohibited
visiter, next to their husband, even to the
household sanctuary. Unhappy women! It is enough,
for them, who break the bread of eternal life, to be
suspected
of such deeds, to authorize you to abandon
them. Are they wronged? God will defend them!---
It is not for women and wives; mothers and daughters,
to rampart, even a man of God, who is charged with
such deliberate infamy. Ministers are but men
it is true---but they should be the best of men.
No man should permit the live coal to touch
his
lips,
until he be made sure, in a measure, of his resisting
power; for, who of all men have such temptations?---
so uninterrupted, so seductive. They are bitterly
watched
.
It is the better for them. The wicked and
profligate
love to spy out their nakedness; and drag them
shivering, before the publick. They know this.
He
knew it---yet he spoiled the innocent---laid his profane
hands, freshly, it may be, from the distribution of the
consecrated elements,---the body and blood of Christ,
himself---he laid these hands, first, upon the bosom of
another man's wife---and next, upon the naked heart
of the virgin. God! why slept thy thunder!---Why was
he not reduced on the spot, to ashes and cinders!--or
driven
,
by thine Angel, naked upon the cold world, with all
the plague spots, black and fiery, as they were, upon
his heart, revealed. Do we delight in such things?
Is it a reproach to us, that we
delight
to tear away the
profane and lewd from the altar?---that we have the
courage to pluck down the priesthood of sensuality,
that are enthroned in the temples? No---we deny it
not. We glory in it.
Lead me to the man that, standing up before Jehovah
himself; aware that the eyes of all heaven and earth
are upon himthat the people of the skies are reading
his heart, and shuddering at his blasphemy; and
wondering
at the compassion of God; and asking, with
their eyes, and uplifted hands, if his patience and
forbearance
be not utterly exhausted. Lead me to him
let me hear him denouncing his fellow menwhile
his own heart is festering in corruption;raining
fire upon the sore places of other menwhile he,
himself, from the crown of his head, to the sole of
his foot, is running with greenness and death; and
I will pluck him down from the sanctuary, though
he be clinging to the horns of the altar. Ah, that will
Iwhile I have breathfor ever and ever.
Teach the boy thisif he be to minister in holy
things, that, it were better, never to have been born,
than to go into the temple, with unclean hands. Then,
lead him to another manone of the pupils of Doctor
, a pupil, worthy of his master....one, that dares
to stand up, before his Maker; and reason, with the
arrogant manner, that men use, when they reason
before
their inferiours....one, that hesitates not, after the
manner of his preceptor, to avow himself an Apostle...
and interrogate the Divinity, even in the pavillion of
his darkness---one, that tore a daughter, from the
bosom
of her father---ran away with her---married her---
and went into the pulpit;---stood up, before the men
and women, whom he had been calling upon, for years,
to
obey their parents
,---and defended it! Gracious
heaven! to what has this world come, when the
ministers
of our holy religion, have the folly and
presumption
,
and wickedness, to intrigue and plot, for novel
writers and dramatists!---to steal away the
daughters
of their congregation---and then---to plead love!
---love, at such an
age
---and in such
people
.
I do not say that
I
would not do this thing....but, I
say that
no honest man
would do it. I do not say,
that no man ought ever to set a father at defiance---
and break into the peace of a family, with fire brands,
and bitterness of heart....but I say that a minister of
the gospel, who remembered his duty, his influence,
and his obligation....if he were worthy of the office,
would have died, ten thousand times over, before he
would have done it.
But....it had become a matter of too deep an interest
to the happiness of another. Ridiculous! Nay, worse
than ridiculous. What!....would an honest man steal
into the heart of any woman....abuse the confidence of
a father....and skulk and prevaricate---yet, never
consult
him. Would not an honest, an honourable man, go
first
, to the father---aye,
first!
at the
first
symptom of
affection, in his own heart, if he meant not to
extinguish
it---and lay his pretension and character
before
him. I do not ask if he should
court
the father,
before he did the danghter---no!Still less, do I ask,
that he should engage the father's influence, or any
earthly influence, over the heart of the woman; for,
women are strangely jealous, on such subjects. To
break the seal of a letter,
first;
to be the first, that knows
of the tumult in another's heart, are things of
inconceivable
importance to them; things, that
men
cannot
understand
but
I do say, that, as an honest man, he should
enable the father to do what the daughter never would
and, probably, never could do;and that is, to
enquire
into his history and character, before her
affections
are engaged. Was this done? No. The
poison
is insinuated; a noble heart is drugged to death, in
secrecyand then, this anointed of the Lord, declares
it to be too late, to think of dutyand that
love
must
have way.
My boyI would say. Behold these men. They
are beacons. Men are frail---their hearts will dissolve,
though they be about the altar, if the hand of Love, or
Wealth, or Ambition be laid heavily, and hotly, upon
them---but, there should be decency in their fall. It
should be regal, like that of Csar. They should
gather up their robing around them and shut up their
infirmities; and hide, if they could, the inroad, that
had been made upon their immortality---and not fall,
obscenely and nakedly, while the sacred elements were
distributing.
No---I would say---No, my son---if it must be; if
thou canst not, in some measure, cease to be a man;
and cast off the most profligate and shameful of man's
vices, seduction and dishonesty; if thou canst not
practice
the commonest act of self denial, that, of
forbearance
in gross sensuality; nor be humble of deportment,
even, in the temple of thy God, I would say to thee, then,
Go down from the altar. Be a
man
, yet, though thou
canst not be of the priesthood; tear off thy
consecrated
habiliments; lay them reverently upon the pile....
set fire to them, with thine own hands; and never,
again, open thy lips, aloud, as an instructor, and an
example to other men.
Wouldst thou be a lawyer? Beware of
this
man's
example. Shun it, as thou wouldst emasculation---.
avoid the manner of
that
man, as thou wouldst that of
a foaming lunatick---and of
that
---and
that
---and
that;
for reasons that, boy as thou art, if thou hast the
commonest
principles of good taste, or independence, will
make them all hateful to thee. Take care to see the
end of thy speech, before thou beginnest it. Above
all---accustom thyself to thinking whole sentences, a
once.
I would as soon have a drunken surgeon blundering
about me, with a sharp knife, as a lawyer, about my
case performing
experiments
upon it, at my cost....
beginning a sentence, without knowing where it would
carry him---and arguing, as the fashion is now,
in
circulo
.
Permit me---I know a man---a smooth spoken fellow
---one of the most gentlemanly and gracious of the
children of men: remarkable, for his vast legal
erudition
:
and truly, I am greatly inclined to believe that
it is vast for no learned man ever husbanded his
erudition
better: and, where there is so little expenditure,
with any accumulation at all, there must, in time, be a
respectable stock---this man, of all that I know, I would
have one avoid. His reasoning is literally
endless
---his
learning, so
profound
, as to be
bottomless
---his
faculty
,
immeasurable
---his rhetorick, and grammar,
unparalleled
.
No man makes so many points: and no man
keeps them so constantly in view,
all at the same time
,
as he. True, I have, more than once, thought, that
the superiority of a lawyer's mind, should consist, not
vol. ii. Aa 2
so much in seeing, as in
not
seeing. The disciplined
vision never sees but one thing at a time: the,
undisciplined
,
(in the person, newly couched, for example,) sees
every thing
, and in the same degree of proximity. The
feeble mind, like the feeble eye, has to learn, after it
has been couched, or lanced: not so much to see many
things, as to see what it pleases, to the exclusion of
every thing else. And, I have always thought
that
logician
,
and that lawyer, who made
many
points, in an
argument, to be in rather a bad way; and that, seeing
more than his neighbour, is rather an evidence, in both,
of a
weaker
, than of a
stronger
sight: while seeing
further
is not. I mention this gentleman, because he is
generally
known: and I would have every admonition felt.
I know not what more, I could say, my dear wife.
Much is upon my mind: but, I have wandered widely,
from the mark, and it is now too late to return. I
cannot even pause, to reconsider it. Let it go,
therefore
,
with all its ruin upon its head. That I am not
mistaken, in many things: some serious; many
frivolous
ones, would be too much to hope, even with my
presumption: but that, whatever I have said, has been
said,
honestly;
with an honesty, equal to its boldness, I
am sure. Farewell! How unlike any thing that I
have ever written before. But, you will forgive it.
Yours
WILLIAM.

It
would not readily be believed; I dare say, that
our chief troubles for a time, were about petty, and
trivial matters, such as the romantick, and poetical;
or, in plainer language, the foolish readers, of foolish
poetry, and novels, would laugh to scorn. Yet they
were so;---and, my whole object in telling this tale, is to
entrap some of these people, who never read any thing
but poetry, and novels; into reading what will be of
use
to them, in spite of their precaution; and instil, if
it be possible, some heathful doctrine into their hearts,
before they are aware of it. Yetthis frank avowal
of my purpose may defeat itthey will detect the
hookand avoid it; or nibble off the gilding, from
the baitor refuse to be drugged at all, however
tempting the odour, or beautiful the colour of my
preparation
.
Be it so, then. Their blood be upon their
own heads. I would teach then, what nothing else,
but humiliation, and disappointment can teach them
if they would let me.
My wife had been educated in a frugal, domestick
way; from her childhood, accustomed to children, and
having the chief care of a large family, she had the
best of instruction in the matter of training them. She
was a woman too, of good senseof practical good
sense; and, while she knew that I was neither a
glutton
,
nor an epicureshe knew that, if I were not a
beast, I would not be utterly indifferent about my food.
Add to this, that I was remarkable for my regularity.
My business was of a nature, that, if I hoped to
prosper
in it. I was obliged to be punctual. She knew this;
and did her best to aid me in it. I never
complained---never
,
by a hint, or a look, but I felt, soon after our
marriage, that my business was diminishing; that I
was fast losing my character, for scrupulous
punctuality
;
indeed, so far, had my forbearance gone, that I
dared not make an engagement, unless I was ready to
go, without my breakfast, dinner, or tea. Poor Emma
was distressed. She resolved, and re-resolved again,
and again, every night when she went to bed, that the
next day, the
very
next, she would turn over a new
leafhave breakfast an hour earlier at leastand
just at the right time. Yet the next day came. I rose
early; went about my business; returned, a whole hour
beyond the time, announced for breakfast; and found
the room coldand the table not set out. This would
happenI know not how often:but once, I met her
at the door---and she coloured.---When I took her
hand
Do not scold me, dearI
Scold you! said I, kissing her forehead. No
dear, I shall never scold---but
But
you know that I deserve it, she added,
smiling---`the servants, I do not like to blame them; but
they always wait for you.
I called the cook up: and repeated my
directions
,
in a firm tone, to have the table set, whether I
had come, or not, at certain hours.
But scarcely had I given the order, than I felt
ashamed of myself. It was unmanly. I really
forgot
myself, said I, to Emmathat was
your
province
;
and it is capable of being misinterpreted. I
pray you dear, to be a little more peremptory.
Choose your own hoursthere is the clock, you see.
matters little what those hours are; but it is of the
last importance in my business, that they should be
certain
. Tell the girl this; and, if possible, make her
regard it. This will cost you some trouble, and time,
I foresee, at first;but we must be patient. And after
awhile, it will be pleasanter for her, and for you; and
casier
, to conform to them. I see that you are hurt.
Not at your reproachesbut at my
own
, she
replied
looking
up in my face, in her sweet way. I
lament, that I had not been earlier taught, the
importance
of punctuality, in our household management.
I begin to feel now, that it is essential to comfort;
it will be difficult, I am sure, to learn a habit of so
serious
a nature, so constantly required too, in domestick
economybut I shall learn it---I
will
Yes, my dear, I know it. I am not impatient. I am
less so, I believe, than you are. Because, I know the
difficulty of
acquiring
such a habit. Nay, I am less
troubled about it, at this moment, than you are. But
that it
can
be attained, is certain, in time; by one far
less zealous, and less in earnest, than you. Look
about you. Very ordinary women, you will find,
characterised by consummate regularity. You will
have most trouble with the servants; but we must be
patient with themmake them, if we can, take an
interest
in our household; forgive a great dealbut, if
all will not do, unpleasant as it is to keep changing
them continually---you must turn them off. Let them
understand this, at once. The first time, that they
disappoint
you
, let the order go from
you
. I will have
them look to
you
, as their mistress, whom they are to
obeyand I am heartily ashamed of my interference
a moment agobut I forgot myself, and wished to
spare you. Let them understand, that the first time
that they disappoint
you
, for one half hour, in the
time of meals, (unavoidable accidents excepted,)
they shall troop without mercy:
and
, that I shall
forgive them for any thing, sooner than for want of
respect to
you
.
Here ended our first lesson. The good effects were
not immediately visible; but, before six months had
passed, no man's family was better managed than
mine. I was never afraid to ask a friend home to
dinner
,
without notice---and was always sure of finding
somewhat, that would be welcome to a hungry man,
at a certain hour---and if he were
not
hungry, he ought
never to complain, if the dinner did not please him---
he would get what
I
got---and what more would a
reasonable man expect?
There were some other little things, matters of no
moment, that occurred; and some, that made me smile
at her affectionate temper, and simplicity: thus, if I
happened to eat more heartily, than usual, of some new
dish, (only because it
was
new) I was sure to see it
upon my table every day---if not every night, till I
was heartily sick of it. These were the natural
errours
of a kind heart, and a watchful, delicate
assiduity
.
Thus passed away our life, for the first year
of our marriage; that season of trial, and
apprenticeship
;
when all the secret affinities; and hidden
antipathies
of our nature, are sure to discover themselves:---
and when, under the process of assimilation, we learn
that our permanent happiness in life, is not made up of
large, showy items; that evenness of temper; patience;
sweetness, and affection, are enough to make people
happy; but that the higher, and more intoxicating
sensations
are more apt to be ruinous, than profitable. A
husband
ought never to be a hero---nor a statesman---
nor a poet---nor a demi-god. He should be a rational
man; obedient, under adversity; submissive to heaven;
and willing to toil all the days of his life, for little
else than the quiet of a family. Would he be great;
terriblelet him never marry. Let him break his
own
heart, if he will;let him hazard his
own
life,
if he darebut let him not hazard the heart of
another
the
blood of his wife, and children. No, no!
no heroes for husbands!
At lastO, how my heart eddies in my bosom, at
the thought of it! I feel, for a moment, as if I had been
in a long, long dream; and waked with the little soft
feet of my boy, patting over my face. At last, I was a
father. The hour of agony had passed; the hour of
travail, to my spirit too; for I wept blood in my
anguish
,
and affrightbut, at last, heaven was merciful
to me; and the dear babe was put into my arms. O,
then,
then!
felt I, for the first time, the sanctity of our
union consummate! Emma had born a babe to me.
Our beings were incorporate for ever, and ever
anewand heaven had embodied the essence, and
spirit
,
of her beauty, and my strength, in one little im
mortal creature. Ah, the tears gushed out from my
eyes, as if my whole heart were running away. At
last, I began to put in practice my simple theory of
educationnay, not a
theory
it did not deserve that
name. I wanted my child to resemble me; and yet I
wanted him to be brave, and good, and great; and I
was neitheralas! neither good, nor brave, nor great.
One evening, to induce an uniformity of opinion,
between
her, and myselfwhile I was alone, for the
first timeat nightand away from my beloved
Emma
I
scribbled the following remarks, on education.
They are hardly worth preserving---nor would they
be preserved, had I not fallen upon them, accidentally,
the other day, very much worn---the writing faded---
the ink diluted and spread; and the paper wet, as with
a heavy, and continual rain---through every page---
and almost illegible. Alas! It was no rainit was
only the rain of her eyes---of her heart---poor Emma!
She could not agree with me; and what could she do
but weep over it!
[15]
[15]
See Remarks, p. 279.
I cannot well pause now. I am hurrying, more,
and more, as I approach the perilous place. Let me
go over it at once. For three whole years, I was the
happiest of human beings---prosperous in my affairs;
growing in love, and reputation; with nothing upon
this earth to distress me, except an occasional
indisposition
of Leister---or Anna, (my little daughter) or
my wife. When one day when yes, yes, I
will tell it---one day, on entering the room, suddenly,
I saw Albert Hammond, sitting upon the sofa, with
my wife; and, when I approached, he arose in some
confusion; and I saw that she had been weeping.
I trembled---I stood still---I bowed, haughtily, to
him; for, some how or other, I had never been able to
endure him, since the disclosure that Elizabeth had
made to me; and, I had not seen him, for a long time.
I had tried to be cordial; but. I could not.
He returned my bow, with troubled eyes; and
passed
,
leisurely, out of the apartment.
I was entirely silent, for a moment; and affected a
sort of unconcern, that I was far from feeling; but, lest
I might appear to be pained, I entered, immediately,
into a cheerful conversation, with Emma; taking no
notice of her distress; and endeavouring to persuade
myself, that I cared nothing about it. But, I
deceived
myselfI deceived her. Yet, I did not know it,
till afterwardwhen I found myself, at midnight,
walking my room, as I awoke, at the sound of a faint
cry, from the bed. I startedbroad awakebut stood,
for some minutes, without knowing where I was,
till I heard her voice again. I was pacing the floor,
for some time, she believedthe sound of my steps
had waked herand she had spoken to me, repeatedly,
before I answered. Poor heartshe knew not, that I
was asleep. I leaned over the blessed creaturehalf
sobbing, myselfand kissed her eye-lids, which I found
all dripping wet, with tears.
What ailed you, William? she said, leaning upon
her elbowand pushing back her beautiful hair,
under
her night cap. The star light shone in upon her
neck and one shoulder, while she lay there; and never,
in all my life,
never
did I see any bosom so
touchingly
beautiful. Her dazzling white hand held her
transparent drapery about her bosom; and her damp
eyes were lifted with such a reverential, and deep
tenderness
,
upon my own, that, overcome by my feeling,
yet, unable to explain itnay, even ashamed to speak
of it, I fell upon her neck, and weptaye, wept, like a
child.
Yet, still, she was silent; silent as death, while her
heart beat, as though it would burst through her bosom
what could I do? I was but a man. She knew my
nature. She had been apprised of it, by my own
sister
;
cautioned against this very thing. She knew,
that I would rather die, than ask her, what Hammond
had said to her; or why she had been weeping? Yet
O, was it pride that kept her silent? Wo to such pride!
I can say no more. I loved her yet, passionately;
and forgave her, in my heart; and sought there, again
and again, to excuse herbut, I never slept in her
bosom, again
never
as I was wont---I know not
how it wasI loved her, none the less---I respected
her, as truly---yet from that hour, I was, another man
toward her.
Not long after this, Anna was born---a sweet,
delicate
creature; and again, we passed away a whole
year of love and friendship.
In the mean time, my affairs had prospered, beyond
all example; and I had taken a country seat, a short
distance from town, where I spent the greater part of
my time. It was a fine old mansion, large, and built
by a French planter, of noble, if not royal blood; who
had been driven from St. Domingo, with the wreck
of a princely fortune, by the blacks....I had been told.
It had been constructed, with every attention to comfort
and seclusion. I was pleased with it, at first sight. I
know not why....perhaps, from the vast, cool,
roomy
appearance of it....perhaps, from a certain air of
nobility
and foreign state, about it. It had been, for
several
years, under the superintendance of a poor
family
,
who had suffered it to fall to decay, until just
before
I took it, when they had been pursuaded to repair.
it. I would have bought the house, at once: but the
lawyer
,
whom I employed, could get no satisfactory
account
of the title, and dissuaded me from it: adding,
that he was not at all clear, about the right of the poor
family, to receive the rent: and advising me, to
correspond
,
directly, `
after I was in possession
, with the
alleged owner, who must have been a man of great
wealth, and munificence. And so I thought....for,
there was a great deal of foreign marble, iron, and
mahogany, about the house: and, to complete the
whole, it was said to be haunted....for what reason,
nobody could tell: though, every body avoided it,
after
night fall---and no wonder---for it was a lonely
and desolate place, with no house in sight; and only a
few of the finest old trees in the world; and a sheet of
water, completely hidden by great willow trees, set all
round it. However, I liked the house, and so did
Emma
.
To me, it was like an old acquaintance....it
seemed to me, that I knew every part of it; and, so
familiar, from the first, was I, that Emma spoke of
it, as if she thought that I had lived in it, before.
vol. ii. B b
I saw Hammond, sometimes, but very rarely: and I
had learned to affect a cordiality, that I did not feel.
But, what alarmed me, more than anything else, was
this I found out, accidentally, that Emma and
Hammond
had been very intimate, before we were
married---or
even acquainted. I wondered, now, that she
had never mentioned it. Why had she never spoken of
him, except, when it could not be avoided? Could it
be! Death and darkness! The hottest fire would not
have scorched me, like that thought! Who knows! I
cried, who knows but she may have loved him!
Elizabeth
loved himandby heaven---
it was true!
I now remembered
his
confusion, the first time that I
ever saw her. What, then, I had passed over, as
unworthy
of notice, now rushed upon me, like a giant.
Love him! No, no....it could not be. Yet, Elizabeth
had loved him---and she had been secret, too.
No! No!
I knew that her honour was mine; that she would
sooner die, ten thousand deaths, than betray mine.
But, what comfort was that to me? She had married
me---but how should I ever know, imprudent creature,
that she was, whether it was not, because she, too, like
Elizabeth, had loved Albert Hammond,
hopelessly
.
Monstrous and crushing as the thought was, it
grew into shape, and proportion; and, such was the
heat and tempest of my wrath, that, had not God struck
my daughter to the heart, instantly, before my eyes,
just when I was ready to perpetrate the deed, I should,
most assuredly, have slain Hammond. Yet, just as
had been foretold, I grew kinder and gentler, every
hour, toward Emma; probably; for such is poor
human
naturethat she might feel the greater
tenderness
for me, when I should have done some deed of
desperation. Often, very often too, when we have
been sitting together, have I looked upon her
gentle
face, until my eyes overflowed;then, kissed
her chaste foreheadand left her, abruptly: sure that,
no, noI will not believe, in spite of all that
happened
afterwardI will not believe it!She
did
love
me! Was I not the father of her babes? her
comforter
?
her friend? her husband? her chosen one? Was
ever woman prouder of man, than she, of me?
But, about this time, a dangerous and beautiful
creature, had thrown herself, immediately in my way.
I know not why I did not rebuke her, at once, to the
dustmy own vanity, perhaps; my desire of showing
Emma that others could love me; my compassion too,
for her(the woman, I mean)a stedfast confidence
in myself; and in my own strength. We met, time
and again. I put her aside. Time and again, did I
forbear to destroy her, though she was importunate
for death; until I awoke, at last, horrour struck, at
what I had done. I had
not
been a villainI had
not
violated my marriage vow; but, under the vain pretence
of giving an innocent, but very imprudent woman, a
terrible lesson, I had permitted her unpractised heart
to delude itself with passion; to drug itself, with a
mortal
poison. One thing only, consoled me.
I was
innocent
;
and so was the woman
. But, she owed her
innocence, not to her own strength; no, but to my
forbearance
;
for, once, she had been utterly in my
power
;
once, so entirely at my mercy, that, when she came
to her senses, I thought that she would have
dropped
dead at my feet. From that hour, we never met;
and I had felt a reluctance to tell Emma of her, at all.
But, I overcame it. I told herand she wept,
bitterly
,
very bitterly; till I, at last, was a little offended.
O, William! I would not have believed it. I
have
not
believed it!
I was amazed.
Have
not believed it!---I.
O, think not that I have been ignorant of it. I
knew of every meeting; every one; and, I have waited
till this hour, to hear you disown it: and now, with
all my confidence in you, that---merciful heaven! how
you look! your eyes! your lips.
I know not how I looked---but I
fell
, as if she had
cut me to the heart. What!---how could convince
her. I had told her,
now;
but how would she ever
know
that I had not told her,
because
I was afraid that
she knew it, or would know it---from somebody else;
O! death! death!what bitterness of heart followed
that thought!
I did not believe it, WilliamI did not!---O, hear
me!---I have disbelieved it all. Letter after letter,
have I burnt, the moment that I saw an allusion---that
---(her tears gushed out, again)I have waited
to hear you disavow it.
I thought of Hammond---but I was silent as the
grave---he must have been the slanderer. The
slanderer
!---how
could that be! How should he know that
we were innocent! He could not. There were all the
appearances of guilt. Letter after letter!---what did
she mean; what letters?
Emma threw her arms about my neck; and sobbed
for ten minutes, as if her heart would breakyour
looks are---are--terrible William--don't---do---don't
look sothey terrify me to death---said she.
I fell upon my knees---Emma! I cried---Emma!
you know my truth! You must, you will believe me!
By my hope of salvation, I have been true to my
nuptial
vow, in thought and word, and deed! As there is
a God in Heaven, I am innocent! As I hope for his
mercy, I knew not that you knew a word of this; or
that you ever would hear of it!
This appeared to comfort her. I could perceive it;
her sobbing grew less audible. `It was imprudent,
dear, she said, however, in a low whisper.
Yes, it
was
---I admit it. Sure, as I was, of
my
strength, it was tempting Providence;---nay, for I
cannot
deceive thee, I am not sure that, if I had been
certain
of never being discovered, I should not have
O, in mercy! do not tell me so, William!--
do
not!
she cried, looking her hands, with a low cry, of
intolerable
anguishYou would not have
denied
it?
Never!
said I
never
. I would have been the
first to tell you of itand leave you for ever(she
shuddered all over.)
William! my husband; she saidcarrying my
hands, passionately, to her mouthsay not so!
whatever
happen
whatever
the time is past now, for any
other separation than that of death. Neither of us
would survive it. Do not be rash!It might happen,
dear, it
might
, strong as you arethatOh heaven!
no, no, I will not imagine itit would kill mebut
if it should (wildly) O, I pray thee, do not abandon
me
me!
and thy little ones!kneel down, William
kneel down, with meO, for the love of heaven,
William
!
do kneel!Come Leister! come! (the child had
crept up, and buried his yellow head in her lap, holding
on at her dress, all the while)Kneel there, dear! Down,
down, with thee, my boy!Swear to me, William(I
had knelt too, I could'nt have stood upright)Now,
swear by thy hope of happiness, hereafter!by all our
loveour children!never to abandon them!never
to leave them---or me---whatever may happen to
thee!
I obeyed---bowed my head upon her shoulder, and
wept there: but I could not utter a word.
Yea---it
was
rash and presumptuous in me;---said
I---my heart reproaches me for it;---it is not doing as
I would be done bya sister; a wife; a daughter; a
dear one---how could I endure that!---
Ellen, I am wrong. I should pray in my heart, that
they might be taught wisdom, by as cheap a lesson.
No!---I will not reproach myself. I deserve praise,
rather
than blame (she shook her head mildlyand the
tears, from her overcharged eyes, fell upon Leister's
uplifted face---
mama!--it rain mama!
he cried---
O!
mama! mama! ou choke my hand!
)I did that
which no human being would believe---I forebore to
destroy a womanthat---nay dear, if it distress you,
I will say no more about it.
Thank you, she replied, inaudibly; but the motion
of her mouth was full of thankfulness and modesty.
Allow me, I continued, to say only this, dear
Emma, for
your
consolation---I have risen in my own
confidence.
I am sorry for it, William. It will lead to danger
she answered, meekly.
And, I continued, much as I regret it, on some
accounts; yet, I have done as I would be done by; and I
would
thank
the man, who should have done just so, and
no more, by a wife, child, orhow pale you are, dear.
I feel very sick and faint---I she attempted
to arise---but her strength failed, and she fell into my
arms.
vol. ii. B b 2
The very next day, my sweet Anna was seized with
an unpleasant tightness across the chest. We
endeavoured
to relieve her---not that we were at all alarmed
about her---butI cannot well bear to repeat it---the
poor, dear little thing dieddied, in the deep night;
and, for a time, all my acquiescence and submission,
was a sick stupor; a dark and blind, and obstinate
tranquillity. And, when that had passed away---rage,
and anguish, and throes of downright rebellion, to
heaven. Emma was altogether more patient and
submissive
,
than I---hers were the sorrows of a mother,
her
heart bled in wardly, silent as death;---and, while she
prayed to be obedient and resigned; she wept, as if there
were nothing left, upon all this great earth, to love; and
nothing, in heaven or earth, that
could
comfort her.
I carried Leister to his little sister's coffin; and tried
to make him comprehend what death was. He cried and
screamed; but his childish sorrow was soon over; and I
could hardly forgive him for it. It appeared to me, so
unnatural---and he kissed her dead mouth; eyes;
forehead
and hair, at my bidding; and wept bitterly, for a
little
while, because he saw his mother weeping; but, the
next moment, almost, I heard his joyous laugh, below, as
if delighted at his release. My heart contracted,
suddenly
,
at the cry. I remembered the affectionate,
caressing
temper of Anna. It appeared to me, for a little
time, that it were better for me to be buried with her
--but- -poor Emma! she wanted comfort. In the first
shock, she bore the bereavement better than I; but,
after
a little time, I found that what I had taken for
fortitude
,
was really but a sort of stupefaction. She had
been stunned by the violence of the blow; and it was only
when life rushed back to her bruised and sore heart,
distending it with new blood, that the agony was felt
to her. O, then...then, learnt I, something of what
mothers
feel, when a part, of
themselves
, hath been
suddenly
smitten with death; blasted in its
beauty--buried---buried
...buried,
before their eyes!
For a whole week, we dared not mention the name
of our child; but Leister was perpetually inquiring
about herand, one evening, when I had been
startled
by some tone like hers; and turned around, half
expecting, in the forgetfulness of the moment, to see my
little daughter thereI found his mother in tears.
How like it was! said I.
Yes...she answered...I thought that it was Anna
herself---the dear prattler. He has many of her pretty
ways, I find, now...I never observed them before; and,
indeed, once or twice to day. I have been struck with
that resemblance, which every body has hitherto seen,
except ourselves...what a comfort it is!God!...where
am I...
now...now!
Oh, what a cruel delusion...I had
forgotten where I was...all that I had suffered and lost
many years, and many deaths.
It is natural, said I...We cannot see our children
grow or change; (seeking to comfort her) but others,
who see them less frequently, do. We are struck only
by the
difference
strangers, by the
resemblance
in
children
.
We wonder that they are not more alike...they,
that are so much.
But ah! how different in temper, they were. She
was so affectionate, said my wife.
Nay, my dear Emma...that is human nature. The
green turf hallows all that it covers. Whatever is lost,
irretrievably, to us, becomes inestimable. This poor
boy has a thousand qualities, that will twine about our
hearts, yet...we must be prepared for it;...and prepared,
love, I added...for
everything
. It is the only way.
He understood me, and shuddered...leaning upon
my shoulder.
How good and beautiful, she looked! said I...when
she took the medicinemouthful after mouthfulthe
dear, little, patient creature...and permitted the leeches
to be put upon her face; while her very flesh crawled;
and she shut her eyes, and held her breath, for
terrour
.
Yes, and when she said, good by'e cousin!...and
good by'e. pa the poor little thing!
Do you remember, too, I replied, dashing off my
tears, with a brief feeling of consolation.. how she
looked
,
when she asked me, if she was going to be put into
the ground?
Remember it!O, my husbanddo I not
remember
it! and how her clear eyes looked up to heaven,
when I kissed her, and told her that she would go to
God  must
her
stay with God, ma', said
Leister
,
putting his head into her lap...won't he let her
come back?
No, my child;...but, if you are good, he will let you
come and see him.
And sister too...I want to see sister, ma'I
do
want
to see her(here he began crying for a moment
but was very speedily comforted.)
That was the first blowbutnow bear with
me. The last is at handI * * * * *
That great house grew awful to me after the death of
AnnaI was afraid to be alone in itI determined to
removebut, some how or other; and, contrary to all
my habits of life, I kept postponing it from day to day;
and from week to week, till I had'nt the heart to leave
it, desolate, frightfully desolate, as it was, to me, after
the death of my child, with my small family. How
often--ah
,
how often, have I started, at the sound of my own
footstep, when I trod the great landing of the main
stair case; and heard the hollow, rumbling echo, that
followed
,
through every room in the house, like something
subterranean. Aye, and stopped and thought, intently,
about itas ifI know not whatbut, I swear to you,
that the feeling which I had at such a time, was much
like what I should think a man
would
have, who had
lived in some other shape, before, in the world. I felt
as if, when I had been something elseno matter what
beast or manfowl or reptileI had been a tenant
of that old habitation. And yet, it was impossible that
I should be familiar with it.I had never seen it, till
the very week before I had hired it; and might have
lived, for ever, without having seen it, but for an
accident
.
In walking one day, altogether alone, I was
gradually seduced by a strange appearance of
familiarity
,
to something that I had seen before, in the walkto
persevere; until I came in view of a large, noble
looking
house. People were at work, in every part of it,
and the setting sun was shining all through ittill the
windows looked, as if there were a great fire in every
room. I did not enter; but stopped to talk with a
savage
looking old man, who was giving directions about
setting up a sort of enclosure, that had been broken
down---the very traces of which were nearly extinct.---
I was a good deal struck by his countenance; and
entered
into conversation with him. He told me, in a few
words, without once looking me in the face, that he was
repairing it for his
master
, and meant to let it. I
determined
,
on the spot, a thing that I cannot account for,
it was like nothing that I ever did before...to take it, on
his own terms; and to remove immediately. A few days
after, the whole affair was completed; and we were most
comfortably situated for the summer season; but it was
very bleak and bitter in the winter, at our new mansion.
But enough of this---I should not mention it all, but for
the singular feeling that used to take me, every now
and then, by surprise; either at the sound of Emma's voice
...or that of my own; or, at the situation or appearance
of something about that house...which made me start
broad awake, sometimes, as if I had just then
discovered
the mystery: and yet that mystery would always
elude me; and leave me, nevertheless, strangely
dissatisfied
with myself and my memory.
One day, I had just been fitting out a ship for
Smyrna
.
She was all ready to sail; and I had been so very
busy for some weeks, that I had scarcely time to eat or
sleep; and, for the second time, since our marriage, had
slept away from home. Yet, I was very happy; and the
more so, for having determined, in my own mind, that
if the issue of this voyage should be prosperous, I
would leave off trade; quit the city, calmly; and go
into
some quiet retirement, where I could live, love,
and die alone
[16]
[16]
Quere. Should it not be live, love, and
lie
alone?
Ed.
with my own dear wife and boy.
It was within a week of my birth day; and I was
planning a thousand pleasant dreams for the future, on
my way home; and felt, I do believe, a more
bounding pulse, than I had, since Anna's death;
and all my heart was running over with warmth and
tenderness. A friend stopped me; an aged and good
manthere was a strange seriousness in his manner;
and he led me, before I knew it, wide of the way home.
Readerbe patient with meI cannot tell thee, what
he saidshame and passion will not permit it.
Something
,
I had heard before; something, in the shape of
rumour; but I had laughed it all to scorn;and now,
for husbands are the last, either to hear or believe such
things, I would have torn the tongue out of his throat,
by the roots, had he been a young man;but, at him
I only laughedbitterly, I
do
suppose; for my tears
fell upon my lip, I remember; and made me start,
while I laughed, as if they had been drops of molten
lead.
I went directly homepatience!patience!thou
proud heartpatience, for one moment!and then
break if thou wilt, into ten thousand pieces!I went
directly home. There was my boy; my beautiful,
bright eye'd boy, at the door;he ran into my arms,
and kissed me, repeatedly, where I stood, upon the
great marble slab, at the first landing.I remember
that
, because he was bare-footed; and, when I put him
on it---he kept jumping up and down, for a whole
minute--
laughing and slapping his hands together, like a
child in a bath---and exclaiming cole! cole! cole! fader
---O, how cole him be! fader!---fader, proper
cole!
---
till my hot eyes ran over upon his face. Ah, little
knew I, what it all meant. I heard Emma's voice; and
ran up to the room---the little parlour above---and
there,---paused a moment, with a strange, unnatural
feeling of doubt and suffocation; for, as I laid my hand
upon the lock, I heard, what my disturbed senses took
to be, the sound of a man's voice, in low conversation,
God forgive me! I cried, putting my hands to my
temples, as if I had been guilty of blasphemy---a man's
voice!---with my wife!.. at such a time. I opened the
door, reader, I
did
, as I hope to go to heaven, with a
smile of affection upon my lips, ready to tell her, the
woman herself, how foolishly I had been alarmed, and
how, for a moment, I had dishonoured her---and
* * * * * * * * * *
I entereda man
was
there!---she was
struggling
,
and in tears; but his lips were upon her hand.
It was not yet dark---but I could not mistake him---it
was Albert Hammond. For a moment, I thought that
I should never breathe again. But the next, I was calm
---very calm; calm as death. I went up to Emmashe
had fallen upon the sofa---at the sight of me---with a
cry, as if her heart had broken--gasping...and white...I
went up to her. I pressed my mouth to her cold forehead.
My boy ran to me---for a moment, I was on the point
of dashing him through the window...but I forbore; I
merely put him upon her bosom...pressed my lips once
more to hers...to her eyes---to her cheeks, and
murmured
in her ear...
farewell, for ever and ever!
She was
senseless; but, at the sound, she shook in every limb...
moaned...and her lips movedbut, I regarded her
not. I turned round...the apartment was empty; I
went staggering, through the rooms, I know not
whither
;
till, all at once...as I stood again upon the great
marble slab...I saw...like a flash of tremendous
lightning
...a
perfect explosion of brightnessor my eyes
cheated me, the same lamp lying there, with the oil
running out of it--that I had seen twenty years before, in
my dreamand heard one general outcry of desolation;
while I bounded, from the top, to the bottom of the stair
case, at one leapas if, at that moment, our whole
household had broken up, and departed for ever. I
rushed onward, grappling my own throat, I have been
told, since, and shrieking as I wentfor my dream,
that horrible dream, was all before me!and I cursed
myself that I had never discovered it till then.
Emma
was the woman that I saw!
that
was the house!
and
that
was the frightful desolation, which I had seen
in a vision, shadowed out to me, till my hair rose!
Onward I went!---blind and dizzy; doing, I know not
what; saying, I care not what; but there were people,
that I passed, I remember; and animals; or the shadows
of men and animals; for they cried out, and fled from
me; and still I paused not; nor breathed; nor turned
aside; but went reeling, headlong, toward the city; all
my past life confounding itself in my mind, with the
present and the future. It was like a great ocean
breaking
up in midnight darkness...covered with ice and fire
-- human creatures...wreck and ruin;...and the first
thing that I knew...after, I know not how long a time
---only a few minutes, I should judge, if any mortal
man could have gone so far in so short a time;...I was
near the water...standing and looking at it, and
wringing
my hands;...and the next intelligible thing that I
knew, is, that I stood upon the wharf;---and that the
stars shone fifty feet, down, into the dark water, just as
they had eighteen years before, when I had been well
nigh drowning myself...for a moment, it appeared to
me, that all that had passed since, was a dream,
that I was still a boy;...but the dashing of oars,
sounded
near me; and I recollected my purpose.
Wait for
me, till twelve
, (it was then nine)
and no longer
weigh anchor, and be ready, at this spot, to take a man
on board, who will come...said I.
I then went to my counting room...wrote a farewell
letter to Elizabeth;...some instructions about my
property
,
giving it all to my wife and child; appointing her
brother to its management;...took a pair of pistols
from the desk, and went in pursuit of Hammond
We met...! don't know how...but we met...God brought
it about. I handed him a pistol, in silence.
He refused it---I tendered it, again---he still refused.
I threw it at his head; and, deliberately,
levelled
at his heart. He never moved---he did not even
cover his face. I saw his dark eyes; and, if anything
in this world, could have persuaded me of his innocence,
it would have been his untroubled forehead, as the
star light shone upon it; and his large, humid eyes.
I fired, and he fell. The report of the pistol
alarmed
the watch. They sprung their rattles; and I ran
toward them, as if calling for assistance. I was
universally
known; and, when they saw me, and heard
that a man was wounded; they gave themselves no
trouble about me; and, I ran down, immediately, to
the wharf; sprang into the boat; and, in three hours,
we were leaping, with every sail set, through the blue
ocean. To me, it was like a dream. Was I a
murderer
!
Probably: I answered.
Why need I dwell upon what happened, in the
voyage
?
I will not. My house---and the voice of my
wife---and the desolation of it, were all before me,
night, and day. We were once driven all over the
water, it appeared, before a hurricane; lay,
waterlogged
,
utterly helpless, and dismasted, for four days,
and nights; every moment expecting to go to the
bottom---the
great sea making a perpetual breach over
us. Yet, I never trembled, nor prayed---heard
nothing
,
nor saw nothing. The sky was like a great
room to me; and the whole world, like an untenanted
house.
But, at length, we arrived at Smyrna. There I sold
my ship, and cargo; put the proceeds on board of
another vessel, returning, for the use of Emma, and
my boy. Yes,
my
boy---by heaven, she never
dishonoured
me. I know it---I feel it, in every artery. I felt
it, even while I kissed her for the last time---but no
matter. I then went, with a little gold in my pocket
to Constantinople. Seven months, had I been there,
when, one day, as I was wandering in the Greek
suburbs
;
or rather the
Galata
, where the merchants of
all nations are permitted to assembleI came,
suddenly
,
in contact with an apparition, that made me leap
from my feet. I could not see the face. It was dressed
in black, after the manner of the Greeks; but the shape,
and gesture, werewhat folly!I really trembled to
see it turn round, it was so like Hammond.
It turned.
Gracious God! It was Hammond, himself! He
uttered
a cry of transport, when he saw me. I stepped
backand shook with passion; for though I had
repented
of his death, while I thought it probable, that
he
was
dead, and I, his destroyer; yet, now, that he
stood before me strong in healthI began to feel for
my dagger. He saw my purpose. By heaven,
William
Adams, he cried. This is too much for mortal
patience. I will bear with it no longer. Thrice have
I saved your life; twice would you have taken mine
and all to no purpose....now! but, raise your arm
against me, a third time, and by the living God, I
will tear you limb from limb!
Vol. ii. Cc
Where was my strength, then! By heaven, I was in
a sweat, from head to foot. A child could have slain
me. There was that, in his terrible voice, when in
wrath, that shook me to dissolution. My ancient
cowardice
returned upon meand strangled with fear
flooded, and drowned all the valour of my blood, and
heart. I was like a child, before him.
William Adams, he repeated, approaching me,
but with his arm, folded---I want some conversation
with you.
Begone! I cried, as soon as I could find my voice:
begone! man!...devil! and leave me. Begone!
You
dare
not follow me, said the Dwarf.
I turned, I am sure, with the bitterest expression
of hatred, and scorn, that he ever saw in man's face;
for he shrivelled before it, for a moment---and then
walked on, as defying me to follow him.
I did follow himso closely that, had he but
turned
upon me, I should have driven my lifted dagger up
to the hilt, into his neck; but he did not turn; nor
look behind; and, for my soul, I could not strike him,
an unarmed man, without seeing his face. No!...I
could not. I followed him to the very end of the great
canal, passing through the suburbs of Hassan
Pashaw
,
and Taphana, unmolested. At last, just at the
entrance of one of the Bezesteens, or market houses;
he turned full upon me; stepping back one pace, as
he did so; and stoodas if he suspected my purpose;
knew the whole nature of my heart, and what I was
waiting forat the distance of about six feet from me,
leaning upon a Turkish cimeter---naked, and
glittering
like a crooked flame.
William Adams, he said, a third time...I have
not sought
your
life---but I am weary of my own. I
heard you speak, many years ago, of your skill in
the broadsword. There is a cimeter, (throwing me
his; and instantly flourishing another, in a circle of
light, around his head.) You then signified a desire
to amuse yourself with me. I have never met with my
match. You would have slain me---I knew it by your
breathing---as we came along. I would not have the
weight of my blood upon your heart, William, in any
other than an honourable way. You are now armed.
So am I. We shall find but little difference in the
whirl, or guard, of a cimeter, and sabre. Only---if
you mean to cut---you must not strike---but present
the edge---and thrust. It has the temper, and the edge,
to sever the bones: it is not by a blow, that they
cleave their felt turbans here. What say you? Shall
we set our foot here, in silence, under that blue sky---
under the very eyes of God, who hath commanded us
not
to spill our brother's blood--here!giving nor
taking
no quarter, till the disenthralled spirit of one
shall rush into his presence, from where we now
stand!...streaming with blood. What say you? My
patience is entirely exhausted. You are silent. I
know not what you may meditate; but I bid you
beware
,
if you think of grappling with me. One blow,
and I will show no mercy, whatever may become of
me. You have worn out my nature; turned all my
heart to bitterness...year after year, sir, have I
pursued
you for yourspeak!is it battle, and death,
or not?
I had taken up the cimeter---but I was unable to
stretch my arm...I let it fall. His voice penetrated to
my very heart. What it was, I know not, but an
unaccountable
belief took instant possession of me, that he
was innocent, and wronged. I know not, Hammond,
what is the meaning of these tears....I would not have
believed, two hours ago, that it was in the power of
any mortal creature, to make my heart beave, and
yearn, in this way...to conjure up, as you have, such
a feeling of humanity in it....to....O, man, man!
I weep before you; I, that have not wept for a whole
year...I stand weeping before you, and am not
ashammed
of it. Tell me...are you not a villain?
No.
Have you not wronged me?
How?
No subterfuge, Hammond: if you have, you know
how
...I cannot speak it. Have you not wronged me?
No, Will am Adams...no...so help me God!..
neither
in thought; nor word; nor deed!
I know not, said I, rightly, where I am...but...
there is my hand...let us go
home
...my...my...wife
He shook his head...but he embraced me; and I
endured
it, though I felt the truth breaking in upon me
again...and then...well, well we shall soon come
to it...I

Return voyage...Wrecked...Reduced to extremity...Death of...
Ah
, heaven!---It is past midnightI see it by my
watch---I cannot sleep. Distressing, and awful
dreams have set upon my heart, and wrought within
it, all night long. I cannot support it many months
longer. I have not had one quiet sleep, for many
weeks, since I found that letter---rash, rash manO
Emma!...Emma! No!...not for a
single
hour. Ah,
what would I not give for one short sweet slumber----
one blessed dream of forgetfulness! It is four weeks
this night, since I finished the last chapter. The work
is near to its completion; and as if, with the ending of
it, my own life were to end, I cannot advance a step,
without weeping---and yet, why should I weep? Why
sorrow? The world is dead to me. There is not
one heart left within its cold circumference, holding
any affinity with mine. And I...oh, there is no
desolation
like the widowed one---; here am I, a
shipwrecked
old man---old, long before my time; a childless
father---a wifeless husband---a fatherless child. O
Lord! Put thou me, into the middle of the deep ocean---
where a black sky, and a black water are all about
me, and over me, and under me; helpless, and alone;
and thou canst not make me more desolate than I am!
What have I done, to offend thee, O, my Father! What
done?---peace fool, peace!---down, down, thou rebellious
heart!--What have I
not
done, to offend a righteous, and
benevolent One! Father! father! have compassion upon
me---spare me! O spare me! I dare not meet thee! I
am afraid to die! My days have been few, and full of
trouble---yet---
thy will be done!
---nay, nay---that is
all a lie---I cannot say---
thy will be done
---I cannot---
no...would that I could
prevent
it! Then would I never
die, and thy will...O, my Maker...never should be
done...but mine!
vol. ii. Cc 2
I have looked back upon the last chapter. I foresee
that I never shall live to complete, what I have
attempted
.
Some other hand may do it. I wonder that
I ever had the courage to attempt it; and though, I have
told but little of my eventful life, I wonder more that
I have been able to tell what I have, so distinctly...so
carelessly. It is incoherent, to be sure...but I wonder,
that it is not more so. I shudder too, sometimes, when
I think that  yes! I
will
tell it...when I think that
these are but the symptoms of that terrible malady
which has shaken our whole house, generation, after
generation, to the dust. IO, Emmamy wife! my
wife!
I return. It matters little how Hammond succeeded,
in winning me, to embark for my country...but he did
succeed; and, though, by a tacit agreement, we never
spoke of, nor alluded, to the past; yet we were
constantly
together, on our way home, to my family...no, not to
my
family
...I was determined never to see her again.
Innocent, or guilty, it mattered not...but let me not
taint her pure name...she was innocent...I feel the
conviction
here, here
, warm at my heart, bubbling like the
milk of woman...to nourish some
hope
of hers, not dearer
to
her
, than this of mine, to
me!
My blood will bear
testimony
to it...but innocent, or guilty, it matters not. She
knew the penalty of concealment. She rashly
encountered
it...andI trembled whenever I thought of it.
What had become of her? I dared not ask. Nor did
he dare to mention her name. What he reserved for
me, I know not:...some pleasant surprise, it may be....
poor wretch!...but he never approached the subject,
except once, indeed, when..I came upon him, suddenly;
and saw him thrust a miniature, that I could have sworn
was Emma's, into his bosom...his tears fell, like a
shower
of dew from the tree tops, into the smooth sea; for
we were lying becalmed, in a water, so clear, and
beautiful, that the shadow of the ship was like the ship
itself. He came to me, and took my hand; and,
perhaps
,
for he thrust the other into his bosom...perhaps
he was about to give me the miniature...but I flung
aside the hand...and walked away from him. The next
time that we met...there was a dead silence between
us; but he came to me, at length, and would have
spoken
to me...I knew that he would...of my wife...but he
dared not. I looked at him, and he stood appalled
before
my eyes. Again, he would have put some papers
into my hand, but I threw them from me.
No, said I...for the last time...
No
...in no shape,
or manner, or form, will I ever listen to you, or to
her!
His manner was very solemn. It is for
your
peace,
William...that I ask it: and yet, I doubt if your peace
would be promoted by it---but, farewell! My
resolution
is now taken. There are the papers! Do as you
will about reading them. But I would advise you to
take them; and, when I am dead, if you should survive
me...read them.
No, I answered...
No!
spurning them with my
foot...I will never touch them again.
Hammond calmly took them up; wiped his eyes;
and we never exchanged another word, till more than
a month after, whenI struck him bloody, and
blinded
to the deck of our shattered vessel. Let me tell you
how that was...We were drifting, a fiery wreck upon
the wide ocean...not a spar standing...the ruins of our
vessel yet smoking about us...reduced to the last
extremity
of famine, and fury. Just then, when all of
our crew, but three, had gone raving mad before my
face...as I stood, with parched lips, and throbbing
eyes, that I could not shut, for the soul of me...I saw the
most beautiful vegetation below me, and bright water,
rippling through it...turf...and singing birds; and
slippery
pebbles...God be praised! I cried! leaping into it.
But some devil held me back. It was Hammond...I
raised my arm, and he fell, the blood gushing out of
his ears, and nostrils; but he still held on, and I...I...
I, Obanquetted on the loathsome...I no matter,
here was another time, that he had saved me...
another
,
and another!
And then, we came home,
home!
and thenO,
My wife! my wife! * * * * *
By God---I
will
tell it. Emma was in her grave. She
had died, of a broken heart. Leister was in his grave.
He had died, immediately after I left him. My
sister---heaven
for ever bless her---she was yet left to me!
kinder than ever, but---a little, a very little

CHAPTER XVII.
Conclusion by
Hammond
...Explanation...Elizabeth...Fate-of
William
Adams...Early intimacy of Hammond and Emma...Emma's
letter to her husband.
A manuscript
has been put into my hands, by a
woman, who, while she was living, had no equal upon
the earth. She was upon her death bed; and she
commanded
me to take it, and relate all that had
happened
to her brother, from the time that his reason last
wandered; and to read no more of it, than what she
seemed to intimate concerned myself. The rest was
sealed up; and I have just read; or rather, last night,
I finished reading, all that I was permitted to. My
hand shakes yet, with terrour and grief; and, I can
hardly persuade myself, that actions, so innocent as
mine; so well meant, as they were, could have been
capable
of such an evil interpretation. I remember my
own agency; and I shudder at it. I look back, in vain,
for consolation; in vain, for the proud feeling of self
approval, that upheld me, at the time of the
catastrophe
.
I am innocentand yet, I am inconsolable.
What should I be, then, had I been guilty! I quake,
to think of it.
Eight years have now passed away, since William
Adams, the brother of Elizabeth, was struck crazy.
He was an extraordinary man; and, if he should have
done justice to himself, in any measure, while telling a
part of his own history, the reader must have been
satisfied of it. He had few equals; but, his passions
were tempestuous, beyond all example. I know not
what he may have said of me; for, I have not been
permitted
to read it; but, I have gathered enough from
Miss Adams, (his sister,) on her death bed, when she
committed the manuscript to my charge, last summer,
to believe that it is a true history of his own life. If
so, I have, probably, a material share in it; for, at
times, we were friends; ready to die for eachother; and,
at times, he was my mortal enemy; but, always
generous
;
and, never my enemy, but when under mental
alienation; or some strong and terrible delusion.
He diedI must be forgiven, for coming to it so
abruptly
;
but, I cannot bear to think of itof mortal
apprehension
died,
from the fear of dying. O, God!
he was heard to cry out, one night, as if in prayer, a
short time before the utter destruction of his faculties;
O, God! God! have compassion upon me! I cannot
dwell in the uninhabited placeEmma! Emma!I
am afraid to die!O, no! no!I cannot dieI dare not!
O, my God! my God! let me live a little longertake
me away from this desolate house!Hide me, where
thou wilt; O, Lord God Almighty! And, many a
time has he caught the arm of the keeper, while the
writer was remonstrating with himand held him,
with his white teeth chattering; his lips, blue and
swollen
;
and, to use the keeper's own wordshis nose,
livid and
pinched
up; and shrieking out, that he
was haunted by two jabbering impsthere! there!---
do you not see it?---O, Christ! Christ! have merey on
me. I cannot die---I cannot! Emma! Emma!---pity
me---pray for me! Do you not hear him? He keeps
saying,
death
is near!
death
is near!---O, you do not hear
it---you must hear it! Ah, my dear friend---stay by
me---O, do! do!---Will you not?---O, Lord God of
heaven
and earth! have mercy upon me! No living
creature
about me!---not one---and a house like the
universe
!
And then, he would fall away into a
paroxysm
of terrour, as if he
saw
something. Alas---he was,
after I knew him---the greatest coward on
earth---respecting
death. He knew it, and acknowledged it; and
trembled like a child; and cried like a child, when they
ventured to speak to him, about death. But, enough
of this. It is frightful to think of it.
The family are now extinct. He, poor fellow, died
but a few months ago; and Elizabeth has just followed
him. My obligation is now in force. I have but just
left her green, untrodden grave; and I cannot die in
peace, until I have fulfilled all that I promised to her.
She, too, was a very extraordinary creature; but,
probably
,
her brother has already left an account of her;
if so. I will not attempt it. There is a vividness in
his language, when in conversation; (I know not how
he may write, except, from the little that I have now
read) that would leave me nothing to say, if I were to
follow him, on the same subject; and there were a truth
and sincerity in his nature, so opposed to all artifice, or
concealment, that, whatever he may have said, may be
depended on. I know what I say---and I am willing
to abide by it. What he may have said; even of
me
,
evil or good, I am sure, was of his knowledge and
belief
.
But, enough of this.
By looking back, upon the incidents related, so far
as I have been permitted to see them: and recalling
dates, I find that the manuscript must have concluded
about the very time; and, perhaps, on the very night,
that he was found wandering, in a heavy rain, about
the church yard, where his wife, of whom he had been
distractedly fond, lay interred. He had been shut up
in his room, for more than a year; and the letter which
is added to this, lay open upon his table. How he came
by it, I know not. He had refused to see me; or hear
from me: and more than a year had passed, since I had
abandoned the thought of explanation; or attempted to
put her letter into his hands. I never knew how he
came by it. It was in my case, and I never missed it
but it could not have been long with him; for I
remembered
having seen it in the usual place, with her
miniature
,
which I had once obtained, without her knowledge,
from an artist to whom she satand had worn, all her
life. From that hour, he never spoke a rational word.
At times, he was outrageous; and, though there were
minutes, when he would look piteously upon me; and
pluck out a whole handful of his hair, at a time (which
had turned as gray as an old man's of seventy) and
sit a whole day together, and look at itand then
walk about, as if he neither saw, nor heard, nor felt
any thing; yet I am sure that he never had one hour of
heaven's light, within the deep darkness of his brain;
nor one glimpse of reality from that, till the time of his
death. Yet such were his amazing powers of
expression
,
that they were many serious attempts made to get
him liberated from confinement, under the strange
belief
,
that he was not mad, but melancholy; and only
wanted a little gentleness, and attention, to bring all
his faculties out anew. Alas!their commiseration
was vain. He was stricken to the heart; and, when he
diedpoor fellow---there was an awful, steady
melancholy
in his eyes, while he rivetted them upon me; that,
had I not known beyond a doubt, that he was mad,
would have terrified me into a belief, that he was
dying
,
not of delirium, but of a broken heart.
Sometimes he would talk of blood, in a low voice, to
himself; and say that many visions, which he had once,
in his early days, were all now fulfilling: and then:
but nobody attempted to fathom the wandering of the
unhappy manthat there were worms dropping about
him; and then he would rebuke the keepers of the
hospital, for abusing him, as if they were determined
to deprive him of his senses.
Strangers went to see him; and some of them came
away, I have been told, fully possessed with the
opinion
,
that he was not deranged; or, that if he was, it was
a derangement produced by a black conspiracy. Poor
creatures! Who would have conspired against him?
Violent as he was---overbearing as he was---there was
not a dry eye in the city, when God smote him with
madness; not a heart, that did not heave with
compassion
,
and sympathy. O, better would it have been to
be exposed to the fury of wild beasts, than for men, that
had so practised upon his stout heart, and noble talent,
to show their faces abroad.
But, let me leave him. He died, I fear, under a
feeling of relentless, and implacable bitterness towards
me. I am sorry for it. I did not deserve it.
Soon after his death. I was induced to make some
enquiries about his family, or that part of it, rather,
which I had not personally known. I succeeded
beyond
all expectation, by an accident, that I cannot
mention here, without a breach of confidence. Enough,
however, for me to say, that, from having been
continually
with his immediate relations, I was mistaken, I
suppose, for his brother Sampson Achilles, who was also
deformed, and dwarfish; and entrusted with a
manuscript
,
which I have the best reason to believe is true,
wherein I find a record of the family, with all its
intermarriages
,
for nearly two hundred years. For my
salvation, I would not make that record publickit is
a catalogue of nothing but crime and madness;
desperate
suffering, and destructive genius.
Several of the earliest of the family in this country,
perished in the ancient Indian wars: one of them,
whose life is contained in the manuscript, of which I
speaka womanwas hung at Salem, in
Massachusetts
,
for witchcraftand sorcery: another nearly
related to the father of this Mr. Adams, a young and
beautiful girl, destroyed herself in a manner, that
would be believed impossibleabsolutely impossible.
She had always been remarkable for her violent
temper
,
and great beauty. When a mere child, such was
the former, that on one occasion, she was confined to
her bed for two months; covered with blistershaving
no less than six upon her at one time, merely because
her school mistress had slapped her, on the hand:
more than once did she attempt her own life, before
she was twelve years of age: and her beauty was so
extraordinary, that an agent of the royal government,
to the last colonial governour, of Massachusetts,
mentions
it, in one of his official despatches, of the day, as
absolutely wonderful, and miraculous. Hehimself,
lived to see her a corpse. She lovedand, the passion
of love, in such a child, was the breath of life to it.
Her parents discovered itshe fled to the woods
went among the Indianswas found, almost naked;
and squalid, with suffering, and sicknessbrought
home, confined, temptedbut all in vain. Her last
words were. Let me go freetreat me kindlyand I
never will see him again, without your consent; but
treat me, in any other wayand my blood be upon
your own head. They left her, taking care to secure
the doors, and windowsand removing all possible
means of self destruction, as they thoughteven to the
bed cords, and the bed linenand the glass. But when
vol. ii. D d
they came to the door in the morning, and tried to open
it, they found it fastened within. They called. It
was frightfully still. They burst it open. She was
found deadlying flat upon the floor; with her face
swollen, and discoloured, though very beautiful, in a
basin of water. In that way, had she died. Who, that
ever lived, could have done the same thing. I have
known one case like it, since:that of a man, who
sat down, and leaned his throat against a rope, until it
strangled him.
A second was quite as terriblenay, a thousand
time
more
terrible than this. It was the case of an
uncle on his father's side. His name was Augustine.
He was a proud, wayward, melancholy man. He was
marriedand had five children. He kept company
with nobody; and nobody knew whither he went
sometimes, for days together. He would take up his
rifle; strike into the woods; without giving his family
any notice; or preparing them for it, by any symptom
of departure. No one knew where to look for him
and nobody dared to enquirefor he was known to
have shot several Indiansand one white man, under
pretence of mistaking him for an Indian, because he
was lurking in his path, in a time of great peril to the
white settlers. At last, he grew jealous of his wife
yet nobody knew it, till, after his death; for she loved
him passionately, though she trembled before him.
He was the handsomest man of his dayI have heard
several people declare, who knew him: tallsquare
shoulderedwith an eye like the bald-eagleand an
arm, like that of the panther.
At last, he determined to die. And, that the woman
of his heart might feel ithe determined to die by the
hand of her own children; those very children, whose
legitimacy, he never could have doubted, if he had not
been a madman; for every one of them was the talk of
the whole county round, for his beauty, and courage.
One day, when his wife had gone to a neighbour's
he put on his wedding clothesdressed himself with
great carecollected a great quantity of brush-wood;
made a sort of cabin of it; lining the whole with the,
driest, that he could findand leaving a small hole
just large enough to admit his body. He then disposed
about the cabin, all the little, pleasant, endearing
relicks
of early affection, that he had left; and commanded
the largest boy to go to the house for some fire. The
boy refusedfor there was something, he said, so
frightful, in his father's look, that he was afraid to
leave him alone. At last, however, he consented
and brought the fire. That done, the father kissed all
the childrenembraced them allwept upon them
alltold them to be good to their mother; and to love
the
baby
, the child, then at the breast, which was the
real cause of all that he had doneand then made the
second child set fire to the brush-wood. It was all in
a roaring blazein a moment. The pitch, and rosin,
and combustible leaves, were lighted up,
instantaneously
,
as by a flash of lightning. The children fled,
screaming, to the woods. And the neighbours, afar
off, suspecting that the Indians were upon them, blew
their horns, and mustered man and horse, in every
direction
and
kept pouring in, to the rescue. They
found the wretched man, and tore him out of the
flames, in spite of all his powerful resistance, and half
suffocating curses; but he broke away from them again;
and threw himself into the blaze. They were
reinforced
;
and, at last, succeeded in extinguishing the flames,
and dragging him outwith a great part of his body
burnt to a coal. He could hardly utter a soundbut
the noise of cursing, and bitter reproach, was
continually
issuing from his whole chest, which was
outwardly
consumed, so that the motion of his lungs could be
seen, agitating, and convulsing, the cindersthat still
adhered to his whole body. Yet he did not diethat
nightbut told them that they were fools, and
deserved
death to them, and theirsfor their meddlingthat
he had been sold to his MASTER, who would call at
eleven, the next day, for him; that, if they had let him
die in his own way, his body and soul both, would have
been consumed; and the MASTER outwitted.
The most remarkable circumstance, after all,
perhaps
,
was that
precisely at eleven
, the next day, he
died.
But the other case, in the same family, was, if
possible
,
more terrible yet; and a thousand times more
affecting. One would be led to think, that a judgment
was upon the family; for none of them seemed to die,
if I may trust to the manuscript, in a natural way:
perhaps, however, it was only a constitutional
predisposition
to blooda derangement, that led to
bloodshed
.
The last was the case of a younger sister, whom I
well recollect, for the uncommon brilliancy of her
dark eyes. She was married to the younger son of a
British nobleman; a small, but very handsome man;
who, if report told the truth, had been a sad profligate,
at home. She loved him to distractionand bore three
children, the youngest of whom had remarkably large
blue eyes, totally unlike the rest of the blood. I have
never heard the story aright; and the manuscript is
not very satisfactorybut the amount of it is nearly
what I shall relate: a part of it I
know
to be true,
from my own knowledge; and the principal facts, I will
answer for. It is only in the less material
circumstances
,
that I have any doubt at all.
This child with the large blue eyes, when about eight
months old, had became the very god of the father
to the exclusion of all the other children, and even of
the mother. It was for ever in his arms. Scarcely
would he permit it to go away, for a moment; and,
at last, he actually slept with the boy in his bosom.
For a long time, the mother appeared to be pleased
with it,and doated but the more fondly upon him,
because he doated upon the child. Before the birth
of the
baby
, as it was common to call the youngest
child, in every family, he had been hardly ever at
home;but now, he was never away, nor abroad. The
people wondered at the change;and a thousand
strange and foolish conjectures were afloat. Some said
that it was not
her
childbut one of
his
that he had
contrived to exchange:--and some were wicked enough,
to say, that the other children were not
his;
or that
he
thought so. Whatever it was, however, the wife, at
last, grew uneasy. Go to the house when they would,
they always found her looking seriously, at the baby,
and rocking the little creature, all the day long, with
her foot upon the cradle. At last, howeverthe
catastrophe
,
which I am about to relate, took place;
some said, in consequence of a meddling, bad woman,
having come to her house, and told her of a girl with
very large blue eyes, whom her husband had loved to
distraction, before he married her; others, that a
beautiful
girl, with the whitest neck in the worldand the
largest, clear blue eyes---from over the seawho knew
the family of her husband; and only came to die upon
his bosom;had come one day to the house, when he
was absentand had fits, when she found that he was
married;and others, who are supported by the
manuscript
,
say that poor Margaret (that was her name)
had once found a miniature among the papers of her
husband, long after their marriage, of such a blue-eyed
woman, with a profusion of hair, like floss-gold;and,
that he had amused her with some idle tale of school-boy
love, until she had forgotten it;but, that, one day, she
came into the room unexpectedly, and found him
comparing
the face of the child, with that of the miniature,
and weeping all the while. She stood over him, says the
writer, and heard him soband saw him take a bunch
of golden hair out of his bosom, compare it with the hair
of the childand hold it to his own eyes and mouth, and
then to the mouth of the babeand then fall upon the
neck of it, in a paroxsym of tendernessduring which,
with her poor heart smitten to the very core, and her
brain giddyshe escaped from the room, without
having
been discovered:-and that, from the hour when she
saw
that
, her own eyes were no longer the samethey
became cold, unsettled, melancholy, and were always
fulltill one day a strange woman, with blue eyes
did
come for her husband, when he was awayand,
after sitting awhile, fainted away, and was put to bed;
and that, upon the bosom of the unknown woman, after
it was all over, was found the string---a ribband twisted
---soiled and torn---as in a desperate struggle---for the
blood of her neck was on it, with a small piece of gold
adhering to it---from which a miniature had been
vol. ii. D d 2
wrenched, while she was insensible; and ground to dust,
upon the floor. After the affair was all over---it is
told that people tried to discover the features of the
person, in the broken ivory; but, that it was all in
vain. And the strange woman, when she awoke, and
found her miniature gonewhich she did, before she
discovered any other sign of life, began to scream,
and tear her hair; and never stopped, until she, herself,
was a corpse.
But let me return to poor Margaret. By and by,
the husband came home; and, contrary to his usual
practice, he went to his wife first, where she sat, as
usual, rocking the cradle; and kissed her forehead
before he attempted to take up the child, or even to
uncover its little face, and look at it.
You look very pale Margaret, what is the matter
with you?---and now that I look at you, again---why,
what have you been doing. You are dressed like a
bride. I don't know when I have seen you look so
lovely
and---but
why so very serious?
Faver
, said a little fat, bare-footed boy---cuddling
up to him, and leaning against his father's arm, which
was affectionately resting on the mother's lap
Faver--Hi--hi---mammy--ee--ee--is
toot---and tut, tut-off ee
baby's head
.
The father paid no attention to the child, for some
time; but kept playing with his hair, and talking to his
wife; and complimenting her on her appearance. But
why so serious, Moggy---have I offended you? Nay,
nay, your eyes, love, are strangely altered...hush (the
child kept repeating what he had said) hush, you little
rascal...what's thatno, no, Margaret...let him stay...
what is it, that he says? You understand him best.
Ask him yourself, Edward said she...It was the
first word that she spoke, and the
last
.
Gracious God, Margaretare you ill!your voice
frightens mesaid he. Come here, Bobwhat's that
you say?
Hi---ime---mammy.....mammy....I's
a feered
---
Faver.
Speak! will you.
The boy attempted, several times...and, at last,
succeeded
in telling the wretched man, that his mammy
had cut off the baby's head, with a sharp razor.
The father went to the cradle...turned his eyes upon
his wife...who smiled, and fell back in convulsions;...
threw down the clothes, and found that the child, had
told nothing but the truththe head was really cut
off..and the cradle was full of blood.
I he story. I admit, is almost too horrible to tell...
but I know it
to be true
, in all the material
circumstances
.
And truth may be forgiven, where fiction
should be execrated.
Such was the family on the side of the father; and
such an abstract of their history. What wonder that
my poor friend became the inmate of a mad house, at
last.
But let me return to him again. Before he
married
Miss Larencenay, before he saw herI
had seen her, and loved her. But there were
circumstances
to prevent me from ever acknowledging my
passion. She never knew it. And when I found that
they had met; and were truly devoted to each other;
as I had no hope for myself, I did all that I could to
promote their marriage; cautioning her, however, as
I did, (for I was an intimate friend of her, and her
family
,
for many years, though Mr. Adams knew it not,
for reasons, which I shall explain, by and by,) to
beware
of two or three dangerous propensities in his
character. But she was a woman;and though I
told her very plainly, that he had shown symptoms of
derangement, more than once, (from violent passion,
I believe)was distinguished for a certain high
handed
profligacy among women; and jealous beyond all
example
.
Yet, she so loved himthat she could not give
him up. I saw thiswhen it was too late;and, when
it would have been death to him and her, if I had been
discovered to have had any agency or acquaintance
with her. Perhaps I was wrong; but such were my
motives; and such was my belief at the time. The
result
has shown, that I had been wiser, had I been more
open and direct in my counsel. I am sorrow-stricken
now; but my heart does not reproach me; for I acted
then
, with the best intention; and feel, only, what every
man of common humanity would feel, who had been in
any manner instrumental, in the suffering or
destruction
of another.
At last, however, I grew alarmed. Emma
Larence
(that was the name of the woman, whom he
married
)
became too passionately fond of him; and, though
I knew that he would sooner tear his own heart out,
than shed one tear upon her hard, if it sullied her;
yet, I did tremble for her. I knew her nature, too
well. I knew that he would never marry a woman,
whose heart he had not tried in fire; who was not
capable
of resisting him to death. I interfered,
therefore
,
trembling as I did so; lest my interference should
be mistaken by her;
her
, whom it was difficult for me
to approach at all, without a trembling and sickness of
the heart; and sure that, if it came to the knowledge
of Mr. Adams, he would cut my throat.
But, he behaved to her, like a man, at the last
moment---a
man!---yea, like a prince! Never had I
thought so much of him. But when I looked, with
some degree of exultation, to their future marriage,
now that he had redeemed himself so gallantly
I found that he had been dismissed---and insulted! I
knew his temper. I was amazed at his moderation. I
inquired into the affair; and, from my soul, I pitied
her inexperience, and their infatuation. William
Adams
I
must take the liberty of calling him so, yet
was of an unforgiving temper, till he knew her; a
man, that would have taken her out of her bed, at
midnight
;
and set fire to the house, if the thought had
entered
his headsix months before, was now so
bettered
,
by his love for her, that he bore, patiently, with
what few men like him could have born. I spoke
to him of it, and asked him how it was.
It is for her sake, he replied, with solemnity. I love
her, too devoutly; too truly, to hazard her happiness,
in any way. She was right, in dismissing me, for a
time; but, she did wrong, to leave me no hope,
none;
after I had humbled myself, as no mortal man had
ever
seen me humbled before. And I am afraid that she
will live to repent it; but, assuredly, I do hope that
she may not. I love her, yetI shall love her, to my
dying day. But, I have now done all that I can, for
a reconciliation. If we ever meet, it must now be, by
accident. I
cannot
advanceand she
dare
not. I am
bound, by my own feeling of honour and rectitude. I
have done all that a man, a man of honour, and a
Christian could do. I cannot advanceand she will
not, though she die, and I die, while we are both
wishing for a reconciliation. I know her well; better,
I believe, than her own father knows her; in some
parts of her character, I am sure that I do. His
interference
was wise, and humane; but, the
determination
was her ownaltogether her ownuninfluenced,
as I am
told
, and believe; (for, I have never met her,
since)nay, even against his influence; for, he urged
a greater time, for considerationand told me, in
black and white, that, if her determination had been
otherwise, he would have promoted our happiness, by
all the means in his power.
Your prudent parents dare not attempt to influence
the judgment of a child in marriage!Why?Their
reason is admirable. Lest, if she should be unhappy,
she might blame them! The same reason should
prevent
them from ever giving her any advice. If it be
not useful in weighty matters, it is impertinent in light
ones. Any advice
may
be disastrous.
I have suffered keenlyjust enough to learn, that, a
certain degree of bruising, quickens our sensibility,
and makes our heart sore; but encrease that, ever so
little
,
and you deaden the one, and make the other callous.
I have already mentioned what the father said.
William repeated it, word for word. He told me that
they were apart, in all probability,
for ever
.
This was unexpected to me: I began, now, to feel
some confidence in her wisdom; to repent that I had
interfered at all; for, such love as his, could not be
mistaken; and, if, under all the irritation of a
dismissal
,
he could still speak so feelingly; and so
reverently
of her, I felt persuaded that he was the man, to make
her happy, beyond all others.
I determined, therefore, to bring about a
reconciliation
,
so soon as I could be
satisfied
, that it was wisest
and best. I waited for some time, I felt that such things
should not be hurried; and I felt, above all, my own
accountability, if I should have had any hand in such
an undertaking.
Time would give me an opportunity of studying his
character, more closely; it would prove his constancy,
and
principle;
and
love;
and her's also. And, more
than that, it would enable me to understand the nature
of that infirmity, to whose visitation, he had been
formerly
subjected; and that strange
jealousy
of his, the
nature
of which, I never rightly understood; or I,
certainly
,
should have done differently from what I did. After
much inquiry, and reading, and consultation, I found
that this temporary derangement of his, was
nothing
more than a blind and tempestuous passion.
---Subdue his passion; and his madness would never
return. This was a difficult task; but, so long a
time had elapsednearly a year, during which, I
had never seen him, but once; and then, only for a
moment
,
transported, beyond the common bounds of
rightful
anger, that I began to feel tranquil, on that score.
I set about the reconciliation, therefore, in good
earnest
;
and, that neither should ever have cause to
reproach
me, for my agency, I made it secret and natural.
Another good effect arose, from this conduct; it kept
each, uncertain of the result, till it came to them; and,
they were happy. I permitted neither to make the
first advanceand neither, to believe that the other
did; thus, keeping a reservation for the worst, in case
another separation should occur.
At last, they married. And, if ever man and
woman
were happy, upon this earth, they were. He was
a most wise, attentive, gentle, affectionate husband;
and grew more and more amiable, under her sweet
influence
,
every day of his life, All the world could
perceive
it. I loved them both; but, there were reasons,
which prevented me from going to the house, except
on particular occasions. I was not envious of their
love. No!it made my heart feel warm, to look upon
them; and their sweet boythe bravest-hearted little
fellow that I ever sawbut, I never left them, without
a melancholy feeling, that saddened me, for many a day
afterwardalmost beyond my power to shake offa
sensation, that nearly blinded me, at times, when
busiest
with the common transactions of life. The fact
was, thatbut no, there is no necessity for telling why
I was so deeply interested in her happiness and his.
They removed into the countryto a magnificent
old mansionwhich I never entered without feeling
that I was in the habitation of princes. I mention
this, because the tremendous desolation that fell upon
that house, a few nights after he left ithad an effect
upon my mind, that I can never forget. It was struck
with lightning; and, for five minutes, I am told, it was
all in a bright blaze; the smoke, and fire issuing from
every window, door, and chimney, in it, as if a great
quantity of powder had been blown upand then it
was all as instantaneously dark again. Perhaps it
was
blown upfor once, I remember hearing a terrible
intimation
from him, thatGod!I am frightened at
my own thoughtbut I must tell itand while, I do,
I wonder that it never occurred to me before. He once
told me, that, if he were ever
suspicious
of Emma's
lovehe would destroy her, himself, and all the
children
either
by fire, or powderand that he was
prepared
.
I laughed at the time; for it was in a moment
of pleasantrybut now, I remember it, with horrour;
for it is quite possible that the lightning, when it struck
the house, found its way to the powder, and blew off
the roofand shattered the walls, and tore all the
windows
and
blackened the whole, as it was, when I saw
it. Yesit must have been powderthe lightning never
produced
such
a change, so instantaneously. I sometimes
met her as I walked, or rodeand now, and then, for
a moment, at church; and once or twice, in the street,
when we usually exchanged a few friendly inquiries,
and parted: but one daymy blood boils at the
recollection
of it. I heard, in no gentle way, that I was
mentioned as an old lover of hersand, as being rather
too intimate with her, after her marriage. I, a lover
of hers!Yes! I did love her, with all my heart,
and all my soulbut
she
the noble and beautiful
woman
,
she never dreamt of my rashness, or presumption.
But this was no tale to be told her by another. I went
myself, therefore, to her home. I told her, as
delicately
,
as I could, that I should see her no more. I dared
not tell her whyI
dared
not. I am not the
handsomest
man in the world; and I should have trembled in
the mild rebuke of her dark eye, had I uttered one
word of myself. She was affected, even to tears
agitated
,
till, I had almost been obliged to support her
with my armbut no!that might not beshe would
sooner have died. No woman was ever truer to her
allegiance  and then, at the most critical moment
of my interview; when she had just communicated
some story, that she had heard, repeatedly, about her
husband, in a mysterious wayand that very day, in a
letter, signed with my name, which she was so
generous
as to say, that she knew had never been written
by medetailing a shameful intrigue of her husband
with a beautiful woman, of her acquaintance; when I had
just bidden her to be comfortedfor, though I had
heard of the story, and knew the parties, the woman,
in particular, in whom I had little confidence, yet that
I would pledge life, and soul, upon
his
fidelity. I did
not pretend, I said, to understand his motives for their
long, and lonely conference togetherbut, be assured,
said I, he is never the man to keep any thing a
secret
from younever the man to wrong youno,
never!
Just then the door opened, and her husband entered,
pale as a dead manfaltering in his step. I was
sitting
upon one end of a large sofa; she, upon the other.
We were both startledand II hardly knew why,
there
was
I knew not wherefore, some feeling of
guiltness, and consternation, about me, which I ought
to have understood, and gone back to explainbut I
did notand left him, immediately, in a state of
confusion
,
and perplexity, that I cannot describe,
exchanging
only a formal bow. There it endedbut I always
comforted myself in the belief, that his wife had told him
all that passed between us, at that time. I have reason
now, to believe, that she did not
why
, I do not pretend
to saybut, whatever was her motive,
she was wrong
.
Perhaps she misunderstood the nature of his jealousy;
and, having gone one step in concealment, was obliged
to go another; lest, by retracting, she should appear to
make the first appear too serious a matter. Perhaps
too, she had heard the same stories, that I had; but had
too much respect for me; and too much value for her
husband's life; a rash, headstrong man, at all times;
but like the bruised lion, where his wife was named
lightly, or irreverentlyto risk our quarrelling. I am
sorry that she knew me so ill. I would not have
quarrelled with himI would have told the whole
truth; and then, if he could have shot me, he might. I
should not have raised my hand.
A long time after this, when I had nearly forgotten
that there had been any ill blood between her husband
and myself, I returned, unexpectedly, to the city, after
a long absence, late one afternoon; I was to leave it
again the next day, early, on a voyage for my health,
that would prevent me from seeing the family again
for many a month; perhaps for yearsperhaps
for
ever
. I could not bear to part with themall the
world to mewithout one farewell. I went first to
Mr. Adams' counting room; but he was abroad, and
exceedingly busy, I found, in getting off a ship to
Smyrna
,
and the East Indies. I went to every place, where
I thought it possible to see him, until I thought it best
to go, at once, to his own house, with the privilege of an
old friend.
I was shown up into the little parlour; the only
small, comfortable room in the house; and found his
wife romping with her boy. She was heartily glad to
see me; and shook hands, cordially, with metold me,
what was true, that she had given up all hope of ever
meeting me again. She spoke of her happiness; her
unutterable happiness; her children, and her husband,
as blessings, in some measure, for which she was
indebted
to me. She was eloquent; and, before I knew
it, her little boy, whom I held in my armsbawled out,
vol. ii. E e
that I was crying in his face. It was too true. I could
not look upon that lovely, and high minded woman,
without cursing myself, that I had been made so
hush! hushmy rebellious heart!thy voice must not
be heard in this council of death.
Whether she read my thought, I know not; but, as I
rose to go, she put her beautiful hand into mine, with
great emotion, saying, heaven bless, and protect you,
noble minded man!
Could I do lessit was the only reward, that I ever
covetedI put my lips respectfully to her handbut
I heard a suppressed breathingI turned
There
stood her husband, again!
there!
like an
apparition
,
before me. I knew not what devil possessed
me. But I could neither stir hand, nor footnor
utter
a sound. The room grew suddenly darkwhirled
round with meand, if I recollect right, his wife fell
upon a sofa, with a faint cryjust as I rushed into the
street, like one stunned by some tremendous
visitation
.
I walked, hurriedly, for a few squares, until
I came to a full sense of my own folly, in having left
the roomas I did. I determined then, to go back
but, on looking about me, I found, that I was far out of
the city; and I hurried on, determined to call him out of
bed, if there were no other way; and put his heart at
rest, before I left him. But heaven had willed
otherwise
.
In turning down a long street, after several
hours of laborious travelling, I saw somebody hurrying
across it, far below me, like a madmanmy figure
seemed to catch his eye, for he immediately stopped
it was all still as death; and, near where I stood,
were three large trees, and a broad pavement. He came
striding towards mebut so wild of mien; so altered
in his voice, that I did not know him, till he had offered
me a pistol.
It was Adams, himself. I strove to soothe him. But
he shut his lips, firmly; and looked like one, whom
nothing
,
upon this earth could turn aside from blood. For
the first time in all my life, my presence of mind
deserted
me. I ought to have leaped upon him, and
disarmed
him. I could have done it, I am sure. And,
that I did it not, was not owing to any personal
apprehension
;
but merely, heaven forgive me!because I
was really willing to dieweary of life. I know not
how often he repeated the offer; but, I constantly
refused
it, until he hurled one of the weapons at my head,
and shot away, with the other, a part of my right cheek;
thereby adding, if it were possible, to the natural
deformity
ofpohpohlet me not talk of myself.
I felland thought that I felt the bullet pass through
my head; and I was thankful for it; but, I still
preserved
my senses; and, after a little time, recovered.
Reader
!
have you a heart of iron? If not, throw down the
book. Would, that I had never promised to tell the
tale!But, the promise has been made, and shall be
performed. If you have a heart of iron then, proceed.
After a little inquiry, I found that Adams, who, we
thought, for a time, had made away with himself, or
been consumed in his own housewhich the whole
family left, that very nightand never entered
again---even to take care of the furniturestay---I
am confounding dates, it was before the
fire
, that I was
at the househad probably, gone off, in his own ship;
as she had sailed, that very night; and a boat had been
seen waiting, at one of the wharves, till a late hour
and then, hurrying over the water, as if, for life and
death.
This hope kept his wife aliveand, this, alone. We
dispatched two pilot boats after the ship; and, instead
of going to the south of France, as I had determined,
I wrote a note to his wifefor, I had determined never
to see her againtelling her to keep up a stout heart;
for, dead or alive, I would bring back her husband.
God sustained her, for a while. She replied, at the
end of three days; thanking me, and enclosing a letter
for him, which I promised to deliver into his own
hands.
I saw, by the date of the note, that she was no
longer
at the country seat; and I rode out, to make some
enquiry of the servants. By heaven, I cannot attempt
to describe the awful and savage desolation of the place.
The great front door was wide openseveral of the
windowsthe entry strewed with the clothing of women
and childrennay, the very candles and lamps were
standing. I went through the house. Not a living
creature could be seenand there were no neighbours,
nearer than the old man, of whom they had hired the
house. I knew not what to doit was enough to
break my heart, to think of the family; and to look at
the noble picturesthe rich furniture, that was left
all exposed to the depredation of the world. I locked
all the roomsfastened the windows, in the best way
that I could; taking care to place every thing, precisely
as I found it; even to the wine glasses, and cards, that
were left upon a table, in one of the rooms, where, I
suppose, that some neighbours had been playing whist,
the night beforecame away; and sent the keys to
Mrs. AdamsEmma. The next morning, two hours
before day, I set sailafter his own shipfor Smyrna.
Three nights after, in a tremendous thunderstormthe
house was struck with lightningbut, from that day
to this, I have never felt satisfied about it. There can
be no doubt that the lightning struck it; because, it
could be traced, when I returned, through one end of
the roof; and, it is highly probable, that the whole was
blown off, with gunpowderbut, what became of the
old man? Nobody knew.He had been seen, two days
before, travelling, backward and forward, continually
night and daywith a covered wagon, loaded down;
perhapsit
is
possiblethat he robbed the house; and
then burnt it down, or blew it upto conceal the
robbery
.
I sailed, as I have said, and arrived at Smyrna; and,
finally traced him to Constantinoplechiefly, by the
beauty of his person; for, he was a man, to be
distinguished
,
among ten thousand, by his lordly bearing;
and, after a search of six whole months, hearing of him,
every now and then, among the JewsChristians
Turksand GreeksI, at last, came upon him, all at
oncewhen I had gone out, after the Greek manner,
armed with two cimeters. This had well nigh been
fatal to us. For a moment, I was a foola madman
and forgot all my errandhis blessed wife and
children
.
But, heaven be praised! I prevailed at last; and,
after a tempestuous voyage, during which, we were
reduced
to such misery, that we preyed upon each other;
we arrived at Philadelphia, again.
We were too latetoo latethe angel was in her
grave. Her boy had died, immediately after our
departure
;
but, hope had buoyed up her heart. The
mother
was smitten to death; but the
wife
lived on;
praying to her Maker, only to meet her dear husband
once more; to meet, and return one kiss of forgiveness,
and reconciliation;and then, to die. She had no hope
of life; no wish to live,I heard the intelligence
firstand I, it was, that would have told him the tale;
but he spurned me from him; and, for a moment, I
hardly pitied himhe had scorned even her letter; that,
of which I would have let out my heart's blood;
though, in his soul, I do know that he believed her
innocent
.ButGod
smote him, to the brain. He
maddened
andfarewell,
reader, whoever thou art
farewell
!I
shall only seal up her own letter, and add it to
the bundle, just as it was written.
She wrote it, upon her death bed.

(Enclosed.)

POSTSCRIPT.
It
has been said of
Randolph
, that it contains too
much
private history
. Ah!how know the people that
there is any
private
history in it? How came such
private
history to be so universally known.
Again. A friend of the author has been asked, a
hundred times, more or less, why
certain anecdotes
are
mentioned in Randolph;why he has let fall his iron
retribution, with such tremendous power, upon the
innocent
and unoffending. Lo!his answer.
To those, who never heard any thing of these
anecdotes
,
till they met with them in Randolph, they will
have no significance---they will pass, for the invention
of a Novel writer. But, if any man should
understand
them, it will be
because
he had heard them before---in
some other shape---misrepresented, as a deadly slander;
and here, he will learn the
whole
truth. A human
creature
,
whose worst fault was, that, if he did wrong, no
matter how
secretly;
no matter, how tempted or
provoked---he
could neither eat nor sleep, till he had confessed
the wrong, and made atonement for it; he once told of a
transgression, that no man
knew;
and prayed to be
forgiven. What was the consequence?
Apparent
, and
open-hearted forgiveness---but
real
hatred, and
cowardly
vengeance; unspeakable treachery and cruelty;
while he was treated, to his face, like a man---and a
good man. One of the many, who so treated him,
went about, telling of him,
confidentially
, the most
atrocious
lies---
lies
, I say; because, although there might
be some fact in them, yet, there were combined with it,
so much falsehood, concealment, misrepresentation---
so much detestible malice and folly---perverse and
wicked ingenuity---that the mind and heart of a great
multitude, were secretly prejudiced against a
comparatively
innocent man, without giving him any reason, to
imagine, or suspect the cause.
The story never came to his earsand how was he
to contradict, or explain it? It came not to the ears of
any
intimate
friendfor no man will venture to say
that, to the
intimate
friend of another, which he would
not say to that other, himself. Strangers could not be
expected to tell
him
the tale; or to inquire into the
truth of it. They heard it,
confidentially
. It was enough
for them, to tell it,
confidentially
. But, one dayby a
strange accidentthe sufferer, himself, came to the
knowledge of it.
What did he? There were persons, whom he would
not injure nor wound, for all that the world could give,
so linked to the slanderer, that, if
he
suffered, they also
would suffer. But then, how should he
defend
himself?
He thought much of itand, at last, came to a
resolution
:there
was no other way. He determined to
write a book, which would only be
understood
for what
it was, (a refutation of the vile and wicked calumny,
which had been secretly poured, like a deadly poison,
into the
ears
of society, and left to run through all the
channels of life) by them, that had heard the calumny;
and
felt
only by them, that had
felt
, or administered, the
poison; while, to all the rest of the world, the book
would pass for a noveland the
remedy
, for a
cordial
.
He did so. Do they complain that the story is known;
that they, and theirs, are dying with shame and terrour.
It is their own fault. Had they told nothing; or told,
what they did tell, true or false, boldly, and like men
or told the
whole
truth, in any way, like men, or
women;
they never should have been punished; the thunder
should not have fallen. Did they know the author of
Randolph; and could they persuade themselves, that he
would permit his name to go down to his childrenor,
to posterityfor they are all as children to himso
blackened and defaced.
Nohe has done righteouslyand most righteous
has been the retribution! The poison, like that poured
into the ears of sleeping Denmark, was most deadly.
But, it was the nature of the remedy, to go only where
the poison
had beenwas
or
would be
. What, then,
if the blood vessels were rupturedand the arteries
explodedand flashes of fire escaped in the conflict
what then?it was not the fault of the physician. His
remedy was innocent, except where it encountered the
evil.
Since Randolph has appeared, hundreds have
confessed
,
that they had heard the wicked, sneaking
fabrication
,
whispered about,
in confidence
, long and long
before; and are perfectly thunderstruck at the truth.
And, but for Randolph, the injured man would never
have known, nor suspected, the extent of his injury;
nor ever had an opportunity of confounding the
slanderer
.
But enough. Let them that will, try the temper of
their blades in this kind of warfare. The spirit of
Randolph
,
whether he be dead or alive, will not abandon
the undertaking; nor faint, nor rest, till he have
rescued
his own reputation, and put to shame the slanderers,
for ever;and, if there be no other way, he will publish
their names,
at full length
, men, women, and children.
That
, I will promise, for him, and in his name.
Editor
.But for
your
sake, my dear Wallace, I should never
write to you another line. I had nearly come once to
the resolution, never to speak, nor think, nor write of
you again. You have been ill. I am sorry for it.
But the worst illness that you have, is one, of which,
whatever be the consequences. I am determined to
speak plainly.You want resolution, steadiness, and
resisting power.
But why do I tell you this? would I mock at your
misery? No. But I would tell you a plain truth,
while it is not yet too late. You are ficklefeeble of
heart; too easily elated; too easily depressed. You
forget me, probably the truest friend that you ever had,
or ever will haveand why? merely because, in
compliance
with your continual importunity, I took some
liberties with your poem; and you thought of playing
off a yet haughtier manner before me, because I
returned
another to you, with my sincere and honest opinion.
Do you want a flatterer, for a friend? You do. You
search for flattery, as for your natural aliment. You
are prodigal of it, to others. Your own good opinion
of yourself is not sustenance enough, for your
diseased
appetite. You crave that of fools, given to
repletion
and loathing; and quickened with a mortal poison,
which you mistake for pungency.
I speak plainly; and I wish it to sink deeply; for
God only knows whether I shall ever write to you
again. One effort I am willing to makeone, that
makes my heart heave and collapseit is for your good.
I am willing to forget all that has passed, on this plain
and easy condition, that, hereafter, you go steadily
about the work of
reformation
It will not be the work
of a week, nor a month, nor a year. But
begin
it.
make up your mind to it. I do not fear to deal thus
with you,
now
. But the time may come, when it would
be folly or crueltywhen I should either pity you too
much, or scorn you too much, for such an attempt. I
would not wound any human being; still less, one that
I have loved and respected in any degree, unless I
knew that it was
not
too late. With you, it
is
not.
Let me conjure you, Wallacelet me conjure you! with
tears in my eyes, to have done, forever, with
flattery
.
Teach your own heart to loathe it. In the next place,
let me pray you, never to ask another's opinion,until you
are prepared for its being unfavorable, and sure of his
honesty, at least; and then, though his opinion be
unpalatable
though
he be wrongfor that may well
be, sometimes; I pray you, treat
him
with respect,
however you may treat his
opinion
. And last of all; I
pray you; if you wish to be, what you may be, if your
ambition be of the right sortif it be not that childish,
brief passion for notoriety, which all young men of quick
sensibility, will feel at timesI pray you to
undertake
something, no matter what, for a livelihood
and name. Hold yourself aloof from the world.
Avoid it. Go to your room; use a regular and
temperate
exercise; rigid economy; and never emerge
never!
but to your grave, or to distinction.
You are yet young. The great world is before you.
Are you capable of this? You are. I
am
have
been
have
done
and am yet
doing
it; and I grow surer
and surer, every day, that I shall prevail at last. Yet
what
have
I; or rather, what
had
I, at your age, of evil
in my nature, that you have not?Nothing. I was as
capricious; sensitive; vain; ambitious, without aim or
object; as impatient of delay and restraint; and as
incapable
of brooking humiliation, however well or ill
merited. But, I have learnt some wisdom since; not
much; but
some
the profit of which, may be yours.
In the name then, of all that is lordly and beautiful
in man's nature, let me implore you. Wallace, to
undertake
this! Begin immediately; you have not an
hour to lose. Begin, and despair not.
You will
prevail
.
If you feel that you are able to begin, write to
me. I will treat you as ever; and not
revive
the
subject
.
If not, never let me hear from you again. I will
have no man for a friend, who is not capable of
this
.
And I have done with acquaintances. My
correspondence
is broken up. My professional business
employs
me, night and day. But, if you accept of my
condition, I shall remain your friend and
correspondent
.
Understand me. You do not know me, if you
believe
that I am to be thrown off, and whistled back
again, at pleasure. NoI know too well the value of
my own friendshipmy own value. I forgive you, for
your neglect of
me;
but I do not, and will not
forgive
you, for your neglect of
yourself
, your genius,
talent
,
and friend.
Do not be rash. You have time to think, before
you answer me. It is hard going back.
YesMr. Pullen has been here. We had but little
conversation, respecting you. But, I spoke very
plainly
.
As to his opinion of me; and the opinions of
all
,
who, eight months ago, thought humbly of me, you are
mistaken. I stand higher than ever, in their respect.
I
knew
it. I knew that I should, thenI said so. But,
they did not believe itit was thought vanity in me to
say soI bore it, though I was told, that nothing
which could possibly happen, during the lapse of many
years, would change the opinion of one person,
respecting
me. It was a rash word; and my heart was hot,
when I heard it. But, I have stood stilland they
have all done me justice, at last. Yesthe time has
already come, sooner, to be sure, than I thought; and,
though my folly and wickedness are not forgotten, yet,
other, and higher qualities have arisen in their stead
in a soil too, that might have been barren, for ever
for it was one of iron. This is the nature of things.
Upturn; or scorch; or trample down, the pestilent
herbage
of
your
heart, as I did that of
mine;
and you will
soon find healthier plants there; medicinal plants, that
might never have appeared, had not the soil been first
broken up, and fertilized by decay, corruption and
death. To be purified, we must pass through fire and
water.
What say you? Are you able to do this?to
endure
it? If yea, let me embrace you. We may yet
stand together, side by side, like brothers, an example
of what steadiness and resolution may effect, in spite
of the whole world.
You are under a mistake. Mr. Pullen never
refrained
from writing to meexcept for a little time
till he was master of his feeling. I drove him to it, as
I have youby a peremptory manner. I will not be
kept in suspense, where I have anything at stake.
Yours,
ALBERT HAMMOND.
P. S.Leave out the
Esquire
, in your address to
me.Boston
.
I have perused your affectionate letter.
Damnation! cried Hammondit is'nt so,he
does'nt call it an
affectionate
letter.
He does indeed.
Well, well, go onI forgive him. It was a good
word to begin a period with; and he does'nt much mind
what the meaning is, in such a casego on.
Your affectionate letter (I heard his teeth grind,
as, I read again; but I went on) my dear Hammond,
with no common emotion. It little matters what the
language of friendship be, so that it
be
the language of
friendship; and I am sure that every word, in this letter
(alluding to
mine
, I suppose, said Hammond, his
dark, melancholy eye, dilating and flashing fire, as he
spoke)breathes it, in sincerity and truth. I must be
allowed
,
however, to differ from you very materially, in
regard to some of the notions and opinions (that) you
have been pleased to express. You have written of me,
as you knew me, two years ago; and as I knew very
well myself. You have continued as others have, to
hold the judgment that, then, was formed;and, as
much of it must have, necessarily, sprung from
prejudice
,
it is not at all surprising, that no inconsiderable
share of it, should have been partial and incorrect.
One of your
classical
periods! growled Hammond,
dashing his arm athwart the table, and sweeping a pile
of rubbish to the floor.
I looked at him for explanation; but he shook his
head, impatiently; and I went on.
I deny altogether, therefore, your assumed
presumption
,
for I cannot believe it to be your deliberate
opinion, that I have been wanting, either in
resolution
or
resisting
power; while I plead guilty to the charge of
flattery
, and a constitutional depression or melancholy.
I have called the former by a very different name; and
its delusions have been so enchanting, that, even now,
it is like the remembrance of a sweet and pleasant
dream.
Beautiful!whispered Hammond.
What you, my friend, have denominated
flattery
, I
have loved as
praise;
and, as I believed it, to be the
uncorrupted
encomium of the good and judicious; the high
and honourable testimony of superiour minds, to
talented
and uncommon merit.
Not English. said Hammond, smilingly
talented!

I sought after it with unwearied, and perhaps,
unreasonable
avidity. All that is true. Flattery, if you
will have it so, has made me what I am;
Hammond groaned.
it has been the gilded spur that has goaded
on my ambition, even to the death;
Very
fine! said Hammond.
it has roused me from the stupor of indolence,
and the despair of ignorance.
Well balanced, said Hammond, rather inaudibly;
and with a sneering tone.
it has been my solace, and my support; my
comforter, when the sombre, and heavy clouds of
affliction
swept over me; and my pleasant counseller and
friend, when the sunshine of prosperity blazed and
brightened around me.
More of the heart!more of the heartif you will,
said Hammond, impatientlythat sentence is too
beautiful
,
by half, for one in humiliation.
When men told me, that such an object was
attainable
by me.
What
object?
said Hammond.
though others had failed in theattempt; though,
perhaps, I had never seriously thought of it; from that
moment, the undying energies of the mind were
awakened
,
and nerved to efforts, which even yourself would
have deemed incredible.
Would
I! said Hammond.
Sometimes, I thought (that) this was done in
mockery
;
but, whether mockery or truth, it was an
all-powerful
charm with me.
Written to get in the word
mockery
one of his
favourites
he
never believed any such thing, said
Hammond
.
'Tis most true (that)
I have craved the praise of
fools
.
There!
there!
cried Hammond, locking his hands
togetherthat gives me hope!that is worth all the
rest of the letter. I looked uphis face twitched,
shivered all over, and his eyes were full of moisture.
Because I knew that, in this world, the praise of
fools, is by no means to be shunned. Who are the
many
and the powerful of this world? Who are the
wealthy and luxurious? Who are they, upon whose
unthinking voices, honour and reputation hang?---
Who are they, that build up large houses, and set forth
splendid feasts; and think it no uncommon humiliation,
to turn the eye upon starving poverty
He means
common
humiliation; said Hammond.
though with a mind enriched with a wealth,
beyond
the worth of the stars?
With a wealth had better been left out
beautiful
without that: said Hammond.
I looked at him, in astonishment; so coldly critical,
so utterly awake, to any inaccuracy, though agitated
to death, by his feeling! It was incredible.
Most of all, my dear Hammond; who are to be taught
wisdom? and how is it to be taught fools? We live in
a world of flattery; and, what was true in Sir William
Jones's time, is even true now; that those who please to
live, must live to please.
Poh, poh!contemptible said Hammond.
But I thank God, that I never flattered man, for a
gift; and never sacrificed my truth and independence,
for a single immunity of purse proud venality, or
degarded
high birth.
Nonsense!worthy of Dr. Johnson himself,
articulated
Hammond, through his glittering, shut teeth.
Hang such lumbering melody!
Of the causes of my constitutional melancholy; or
rather, of those which have had a tendency to heighten it.
I forbear to speak. You know enough of them,
already
;
and it is now worse than useless, to scar afresh, the
wounds, and make them bleed, merely for the pleasure
of binding them up again.
Beautiful! said Hammond; that is
natural
that
is the unstudied language of a full heart.
Indeed, one is almost sick of hearing of Melancholy,
now. She is a prostituted divinity; and no longer
walks the darksome grove, clad in purple and pall.
She is disrobed of her attributes; and the beauty, of her
mysterious power, is gone for ever! Every unfledged
babe of divinity

to himself.
is now called a
melancholy young man
simply
because he wears a neck-cloth of white, wreathed, like
a bow-string, round his neck; and walks with downcast
eye: and has a changeful cheek, of hectick hue. I
sometimes
loathe myself, when I see this morbid corruption,
festering, like a cancer, in the bosom of others: and
when the
affectation
of it appears, I turn away from it,
as I do, from the all fearful imagination of Milton's
hell-hounds, kennelling in the womb of Sin.
The work of reformation that you so earnestly
wish me to begin, from these candid confessions,
appears
to my mind, less necessary than you had reason to
think.
Awkward said Hammond.
The truth is, the more that I have been thrown
upon my own resources, the more palpably Necessity,
with all her dire train of shapes and spectres, have

and presented themselves.
Herself;
said Hammond.
The devil take your interruptions, cried I---losing
all patience. I never shall get to the end of it, at this
rate.
Go on, go on; said henever mind what I say.
I treat myself in the same way.
across my pathso much the more resolute have
I grown; and, like Antus, stronger, from each fall.
Think not, because I have been silent, that your friend
has been idle.
Meaning
himself;
said Hammondbadly
expressed
.
Think not, because he has been slow to confess
the indiscretion of the past, that he can ever be
ungrateful
:
but above all, think not that his professions of
friendship die in an hour, like those sweet and
beautiful
plants, which spring up in the desert, only to perish
under the hot breath of the pestilential simoom.
Very beautiful! said Hammond
very!
I know
something of that blasted herbagethe vegetation of
the wilted heartgo ongo on.
There was a depth and mournfulness in his tone,
then, that made me stop, and throw my eyes upon his
countenanceit was very solemn; but, I obeyed.
The hours of darkness are passing rapidly away; I
think I may truly say, that your best hopes, if not
realized
,
are fast approximating to their goldenest
fruition
.
I rejoice with you, my friend, that you are
rising
so high in popular love.
Pshaw! cried Hammond;
popular
lovepshaw!
I pray God that none of your brilliant visions
may be disturbed by the shadow of doubt; the
abreviations
of time; or the failure of hope. For myself, I am
able to endure, if endurance be for good.
If!
cried Hammondreverently

to

but, go on.

unfolded snake writhes among its flowers
Ha!that
is
poetry; cried Hammond, locking his
hands fervently; and his delighted eyes glared, it
appeared
to me, for moment, like great carbuncles, with
a coloured fire.

Surgit amari aliquid quod in ipsis floribus angat!
Though I have often been deceived by the hollow
breath of false counsel; and falser friendship. Yet, I
cannot but rejoice, that it has so been: even from such
wrecks, we may gather much instruction for the
voyage
of our lives; this, at least, they may teach us---to
avoid the shallow and miseries of others: (full of
confusion
said
Hammond:) and to hold an onward course,
undisturbed by the past, and mindful of the future
only.
What! and disregard the presentno, no friend
Wallace: that is a little too classicalhollow breath
won't dothe wrecks of

inwardly

VOL. II. L 2
Like you, I have grown tired of acquaintances: and
still more, of their correspondence. They are well
enough, in every-day life, because they form a part in
that great community, with whom, it is
fashionable
to be
on good terms. In the drama of life, they play the
inferiour
parts of the dramatis person: but, after all, are
very necessary to its representation.
Truly, and sincerely yours,
WALLACE.
