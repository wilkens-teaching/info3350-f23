BOOK I.
CHAP. I.
TEAGUE having thus departed, it
became
the Captain to look out for
another
servant
; and deliberating on this
subject
,
Mr. M`Donald the Scotch
gentleman
,
of whom we have before
spoken
,
happening
to enter, the Captain explained to
him the
circumstance
, and made enquiries
with regard to his knowledge of any one
that
chose
to be employed in this way, and
might be fit for the
service
. Said Mr.
M`Donald, I ken a lad right weel of the
name o' Duncan
Ferguson
, frae about
Perth in Scotland, that is
trusty
and vera
fit to wait upon a gentleman, except it be
that he may gie ye o'er muckle trouble
about
religion, having had a vera
strict
education
i' the
presbytery
; gin ye can put
up wie that, I fal warrant him
honest
, and
vera
vera faithful to his
master
, and that he
take guid care of your
horse
. He is about
thirty years of age, and has been a guid
deal in
service
, and knows what it is to
wait on guid
houses
, in his ain kintra; I
dina ken how he may
suit
all places in
these
parts; but wie a man of your judgment,
I think he may do vera weel.
The Captain thanked him for the
information
;
and having conceived a good
opinion
of Mr. M`Donald's integrity and
sense
, he was willing to take the young
man upon the recommendation he had
given
.
Accordingly he being
sent
for by Mr.
M`Donald, the North Briton came, and
presented
himself
to the Captain. The
wages of his
service
being agreed upon, he
entered on his functions the
same
day; and
in a
short
time the Captain having paid his
bills in the city,
set
out with Duncan on
the
same
rout with Teague.
CHAP
CHAP. II.
DUNCAN in like manner with
Teague
had to walk on foot, for the
Captain could not afford to
purchase
another
horse
, more
especially
as he had
considerably
exhausted
his finances, by the late
equipment of Teague. But even could he
have made it convenient to have
increased
his cavalry, the expences of travelling
would have been
increased
, which he could
not
also
well afford; or which it would
not have been within the limits of a
discreet
economy to have incurred. For
travelling
slowly
, the
servant
could without
weariness
equal the pace of his
master
on
horse
-back.
Besides
, it gave
diversity
, and
had more the air of ancient
custom
, than
being both mounted. It was in this
manner
,
the Gauls who fought with C
sar
equipped
their dragoons, as we learn from
the Commentaries; and
also
the Numidian
horse
under Jugurtha, as we learn from
salust
Salust
, had each a foot-man by his
side
,
who
sometimes
assisted
himself
by the mane
of the quardruped in running; but was at
all times
considered
as attached to the
rider, and ready to
subserve
him in battle.
The Scotchman, moreover, had but a light
luggage to carry; being nothing more
than a couple of
shirts
, a pair of
stockings
,
a Kilmarnock cap, a
Confession
of Faith,
Satan's
invisible
kingdom
discovered
, and
Crookshank
's
history
of the Covenanters.
It was upon the topic of religion that the
conversation
first
turned, Duncan
asking
the Captain of what denomination he was.
I am denominated Captain,
said
he; but
my name is John Farrago, though I have
had other epithets
occasionally
given me by
the people
amongst
whom I have happened
to
sojourn
,
especially
since
my
last
setting
out on my travels, after the manner of the
antient chevaliers. I have been called the
modern Don Quixotte, on account of the
eccentricity of my rambles, or the
singularity
which they conceive
themselves
to
discover
in my
conversation
and manner.
I have been called the Knight of the
single
Horse
, having but one
myself
, and none for
my attendant; in this particular unlike
my
predecessors
,
whose
squires
were
mounted
mounted as well as
themselves
. In
some
places I have taken my
designation
from
the
Irish
valet that I had, and of whom you
have heard me
speak
, of the name of
Teague
,
and have been called the Owner of the
red-headed Bog-trotter; as it is probable I
may now be
designed
occasionally
by the
appellation of the
Master
of the raw
Scotchman
,
by
those
who may be able by your
dialect to
dislinguish
your origin. But all
these
things I look upon as
inconsiderable
.
It is of little, or perhaps of no
consequence
to me, what my
stile
is
amongst
men;
provided
it contains nothing in it that may
impeach
my moral character, and may
seem
to have been drawn from
some
bad quality
or vicious habit of the intellect. They may
call me Don Quixotte, or Hudibras, or
the Knight of the Blue Beard, or the Long
Nose
, or what they
please
. It is all the
fame to me; and gives no affront,
unless
containing a reflection on my
understanding
or integrity.
Captain,
said
Duncan, it canna be, but
ye ken right weel what I mean. It is na
the denomination o' your temporal
capacity
,
that I wad be at; but of your religion,
and to what
perswasion
ye belong;
whether
er
o' the Covenant, or of the Seceders, or
the high kirk o' Scotland.
Duncan,
said
the Captain, I am not
such
an adept in faith, as to be acquainted with
these
nice
distinctions
. I have
some
knowledge
of the
Christian
religion in general,
but not of
those
more minute
subdivisions
of
which it is probable you
speak
. For I have
understood
that
Christianity
is the national
religion in Scotland, and I
presume
what
you call Covenanters, and Seceders, are
sections
from the general
establishment
, and
subordinate
to the
worship
of the kingdom.
It has not come in my way, nor have I
much ambition to be more particularly
acquainted
.
There is a degree of
information
on
most
subjects
which it becomes a
gentleman to have; but the going beyond
this may favour of pednatry, and argue the
having
spent
more time in trifles, than
bespeaks
strength
of mind and elevated
talents
.
Just
as we
respect
the
naturalist
who
amuses
us with the
philosophy
of great
objects
;
but
smile
at him
whose
life is
occupied
in catching butterflies, or gathering
petrified
shell
-
fish
. Or to give a
simile
that
conveys my meaning better;
skill
in
language
,
either to write or
speak
, is a
noble
attainment; but this
consists
more in
a
a
just
taste
of the leading beauties, than
in the
criticisms
of a mere grammarian,
which
shew
the mind to have been wholly
or chiefly taken up with
these
: To
use
the
words of the poet,
Word-catchers that live on
syllables
.
Commas and points they
set
exactly right,
And 'twere a fin, to rob them of their might.
The
most
liberal
studies
may be
pursued
to an illiberal
excess
; as for
instance
in
music
, where it
must
be
considered
as an
elegant
accomplishment
to have
some
talents
;
yet not to have made
such
proficiency
in the execution, as to induce a
suspicion
of attention to this art, to the neglect of
others. I have taken care to acquire a
general
knowledge of the
surface
of this earth,
from the maps; yet have not made
myself
master
of the
situation
of every
slough
, or
bog that may be found in your country, or
exact bearing of hill or mountain there.
In the
same
manner, I may know that you
are
Christians
in that
island
, but nothing
more.
What, man!
said
Duncan, ha' ye never
heard o' the Solemn League and
Covenanr
.
I have heard,
said
the Captain, of
many Leagues and Covenants. In the time
of
of Henry IV. in France there was what
was called the League. The family of
Guise
was at the head of this, and
opposed
to the
Protestants
. It is probably a branch
of this that has come over into Scotland,
and kept up the name, after having been
broken by that heroic Prince, and
afterwards
taken away altogether, by his
conversion
to the mother church, and
peaceable
possession
of the kingdom.
By that, ye wad make out the
Covenanters
to be a relict of Popery,
said
Duncan
.
I ken ye right weel, Captain; ye
canna
be
sae
ignorant as not to know that the
Covenanters are the very
reverse
o' Popery.
Did ye never read
Crookshanks
? Did ye
never hear o' the
persecution
.
I have heard of the ten
persecution
under
the Roman Emperors,
said
the
Captain
.
Under ten Deevils, faid Duncan. I
am
speaking
o' the
persecutions
in
Scotland
;
when the
ministers
were hanged at
Ayr.
The Captain
saw
that his valet was
beginning
to be warm on the
score
of
religion
;
and that it would be difficult to
continue
the
conversation
in any
shape
without
giving him offence. He was therefore
disposed
to
address
his pride, and
please
him
by
Vol. IV. B
by an acknowledgement of ignorance; at
the
same
time
proposing
a
readiness
to be
instructed
in the peculiar tenets of the
faith of the Covenanters.
Duncan,
said
he, you are under a
mistake
as to the opportunities of education
in this country. It is not as in Scotland,
where the
Christian
religion has been
planted
above a
thousand
years, and the
reformed
church
established
a century or two;
where clergymen are numerous, and
religious
books plenty. Ay,
said
Duncan,
where ye have preaching
amaist
every day
of the week, and twice on the Sabbath. Ye
canna
set
your face any way, but ye hae a
kirk before you. Catechizing o' the
children
begins
amaist
as
soon
as they are
born; and examining the grown people,
in
visits
at the
house
; wie a
strict
discipline
,
that calls to the
session
for things that
scandalize
the morals. Ye
sal
find many guid
bukes there
published
by the
Erskines
,
and the
Gillises
. Did ye e'er read Peden's
Prophesies
? I have read nothing of this
kind,
said
the Captain; for I was
observing
to you, that in America we have not
these
opportunities. For my own part, I
have lived a good deal in the rout of
clerical
functionaries, where they have
passed
and
and
repassed
, and have heard their
sermons
,
and
conversed
with them; and
though they may have been
distinguished
amongst
themselves
as orthodox or
heterodox
;
or under
several
names, or by
various
particulars of doctrine; yet the
differences
appeared to me
so
minute, that I
never
thought it worth while to trace them;
and they made
themselves
acceptable to
me,
less
or more, by the greater
harmony
of voice, or elegance of language, or
gesture
; or by the
justnses
of their
observations
on the obligations of morality
amongst
men, and the good
consequences
to
society
and to the individual.Have ye
read
Willison
on the
Catechism
, or
Halyburton
,
or
Boston
's Fourfo d State, or
Durham on the Revelation?
said
Duncan.
Nothing of all
these
,
said
the Captain. Said
Duncan, I ha' got the
Confession
of Faith
in my wallet here; I wad lend it to you to
get a piece of it by heart, if ye wad
promise
to take guid care o' the buke. My
memory is not good,
said
the Captain,
especially
in that artificial
exercise
of it, which
consists
in committing
abstract
ideas. What
touches my affections, I remember without
trouble, and
sentiments
which are obvious
and natural; and I
should
think the early
mind
mind would be better occupied in reading
some
instructive
fables, than in committing
these
dogmas of divinity, that are
untelligible
to any but
theologists
themselves
; nay
not even by them incontrovertibly; for
otherwise
how
should
they differ
so
much
in their
illustrations
of them. However, I
have no inclination to be led into a debate
with you, Duncan, on a
subject
where
you are
so
much my
superior
. But you
will
excuse
me in committing the
Confession
of Faith to memory; at my age it
is painful to apply to a thing as to a
task
.
Duncan acknowledged the truth of this,
and was
disposed
to
excuse
him; but
recommended
him to read the
sermons
of
the reverend John Dick, and Saunders
M`Alpin.
CHAP
CHAP. III.
Having
travelled this day without
any remarkable occurence, and
puting
up at an inn in the evening, Duncan
had taken care of the
horse
, in having him
well rubbed down, and having
seen
his oats
given him, and the rack well filled with hay.
A gentlemen had
also
that evening put up
at the inn, and
whose
servant
had been
engaged
at the
same
time with Duncan, in
taking care of his
respective
master
's
horse
.
This valet, whether from reading Thomas
Paine's Age of
Reason
, which had been
published
about this time, or to the
sceptical
conversation
of
some
one in his way,
was far from being orthodox in his notions
of religion; or rather was
sceptical
with
regard to religion altogether; and had not
been
accustomed
to the
strictest
propriety
in the choice of his
expressions
; which
became
apparent, in a
short
time, from his
use
of
suppletives
that are common with
pro-
B 2
profane men, when they would enforce
what they have
asserted
; or when
prompted
by
passion
, they are carried beyond the
bounds of decorum, in imprecations on
themselves
or the incidental
cause
of their
injury. Whether the
horse
had not
maintained
a proper
position
in currying him,
or that the valet thought he did not, is
uncertain
;
but
so
it was, that in the
course
of his labour he broke out into
occasional
sallies
of ill humour; or perhaps, from mere
habit, and without any
cause
at all, he
began
to damn the
soul
of the
beast
.
Duncan
could not avoid taking notice of it, and
reprimanding him for his profanity. The
other gave him no other thanks than to
damn his
soul
also
; which language began
to
raise
the blood of Duncan; but he
repressed
his
resentment
for the
present
, and
was
silent
until they both came to
sit
down
to
supper
in the kitchen of the public
house
, the gentlemen above having already
supped
; when Roderick, for that was the
name of the valet, began to eat, not
having
first
said
grace. At this Duncan
losing
all patience, broke out upon him. Sirrah,
said
he, I could make an
excuse
for your
damning the
soul
o' your
beast
;
because
I
dinna believe he has a
soul
, and in that
cafe
case
ye were doing nothing mare than
making
use
o' a bad
expression
; but ha' ye
na mare decency, than to fall to your meat
without
asking
a
blessing
on what is
set
before
you; more than your
horse
i' the
stable
,
when he falls to his oats? what could
ye expect frae a dumb
beast
? but with ane
o' the
shape
o' a
Christian
creature, it
favours
o' infidelity. Ha' ye na
sense
o'
religion
?
Did ye never
see
the
Confession
o'
Faith; or the Larger or Shorter
Catechism
?
Are ye na afraid, the devil will get
power o'er you, and make ye hang
yoursel
.
Hang the devil,
said
Roderick. I am
not afraid of the devil; I could kick him,
and cuff him, and play hell with him.
Guid deliver us! what
blasphemy
,
said
Duncan; I am afraid young man, ye may
get a trial o't, you'l
see
then wha o' ye
will be
uppermost
. I'll lay my lug for it,
ye dinna
stand
him twa
shakes
, for a
sae
stout
as ye are. Ye had better
seek
the Lord,
and be out o' the reach o' Satan.
I never
saw
any greater devil than
myself
,
said
Roderick; nor do I believe there
is any, I
wish
I
saw
this Satan of yours; I
would take a knock with him; I would
bite, and gouge him, and,
This he
said
jumping to his feet,
tretching
out his hands towards Duncan, and
grinning at the
same
time.
Duncan could
sustain
it no longer, but
making his
escape
from the kitchen, ran
to the chamber where the Captain was with
the gentlemen, taking a
glass
after
supper
:
Exclaiming with great vehemence, he gave
them to
understand
that the muckle deel
himsel
was in the
house
below
stairs
. I did
na
just
see
his horns, and his cloven foot,
said
he; but I ken him right weel by his
way o' talking, when he was i' the
stable
wie the gentleman's
horse
, rubbing him
down, he
cursed
, and
swear
'd like a
devil
;
and when he came to
sipper
, he could
na bide the
blessing
, but when I
spake
o'
grace, he brake out into profane language;
and at
last
fairly acknowledged that he was
the deel
himsel
. Guid guide us, that we
should
hae the devil among us! I wad na
be
astonished
if he has the kitchen aff in a
flame o' fire, before we gae to bed yet. I
hae Satan's
invisible
kingdom
discovered
wi' me, in my bags. It gies great account
o'
thesethings
. The like happened at
Drumalawrig
ance before; and the guid folk
had a great deal o' wark to get the muckle
thief out o' their
sight
again.
The Captain and gentleman were at a
loss
to
to
understand
this
rhapsody
; and could
only in general collect from it, that he
conceived
himself
to have
seen
the devil.
Where is this devil?
said
the Captain. Can
ye
shew
him to us, Duncan? I can
soon
do that,
said
Duncan. I left him i' the
kitchen at his meat; but I trow he does na
eat muckle. It is a' a pretence, to
pass
for
one o' us. But gin ye
sing
a
psalm
, or
pronounce a
verse
o' the Bible, or gae
about
prayer, I
sall
warrant ye
sall
soon
see
him in his proper figure, wi' his horns and
his cloven foot girnning at ye,
just
as he
had come out o' hell about an hour ago.
Let us
see
him, Duncan,
said
the
Captain
,
and examine into
these
circumstances
.
The Captain and the gentleman had
supposed
that
some
wag,
amongst
the
servants
of the public
house
, had been
attempting
to
amuse
himself
with the
credulity
of Duncan, having
discovered
him to
be of a
superstitious
cast
of mind; and that
with
some
kind of vizor to the face, and
uncouth
dress
to the
person
, he had
assumed
a frightful form, and
imposed
upon him
the idea of a demon. Under this
impression
they went forward, Duncan with fear
and trembling, lurking behind, and
eyeing
ing
carefully the
scene
as they
approached
.
Entering the kitchen, Duncan
started
,
and exclaimed, The Lord deliver
us! there he is, eating at his meat, as if
he was a creature above ground, though
ye may all
see
that he has the
physiognomy
of Belzebub. Of whom do you
speak
,
said
the Captain? of that muckle chiel there,
said
Duncan, i' the blue jacket, and the
lang breeks;(it was a pair of overalls);
that Satan-luking fallow, continued he,
wha puts the bread in his mouth, and
sits
wi' his
backside
on a
stool
, as if he were
ane o'
oursels
; and had na been i' the
bottomless
pit
these
twelve months. But
gin ye
speak
till him, I
sall
warrant ye
sal
soon
hear him talk the dialect of hell,
and
curse
and
swear
like a fiend, and girn
like the deel
himsel
; and
shew
his cloven
foot very
soon
, tak my word for't.
Why that is my
servant
,
said
the
gentleman
.
Ay, ay,
said
Duncan, I dinna doubt
that; he may hae
passed
himsel
for your
servant
. But that does na hinder him to
be the de'el. Dinna ye hear what the
apostle
says
, he can transform
himself
into
an angel o' light. It canna be a great
trouble then to take the
shape
o' a waiting
man,
man, and
sit
before a pair o'
saddle
bags.
If ye read Satan's
invisible
kingdom
discovered
,
which I hae in my portmantles,
ye
sal
find that the devil can make
himself
a
minister
, and gae into the pulpit, and
conduct
himself
very weel, aye'till it comes
to the prayer, and then off he gaes thro'
the window, or takes the gavel o' the
house
wie him. It happened once at Linlithgo,
that he tuke the
shape
o' a guid auld
man, the reverend doctor Bunnetin, and
undertook to preach the action
sermon
at
a
sacrament
; but gaed awa in a flight o'
fire,
just
as he came to gie out the text.
Ah,
sirrah
,
said
he,
addressing
himself
to
Roderick, are ye there yet? ye think
because
the folk here in America dinna ken
ye, no ha'ing Satan's
invisible
world
discovered
among their printed bukes, that
for that
reason
, I wad na ken ye. I ken
ye weel enough, auld Reeky. Gae back,
to Scotland, and take the
shape
o'
muckle
dogs there, whare there are guid foks
that dinna
sear
ye; and no come o'er the
burn till America, where the
gospel
is na
yet planted, and there is na need for ye.
What have you been doing to this man,
said
the gentleman to Roderick, that he
has conceived you to be the devil.
No.
Nothing more
said
the valet, than that
when we
sat
down to eat he
insisted
on
saying
prayers
first
, and talked like a fool
about religion. I was hungry, and did
not like to wait for prayers. He talked
about the deel. I told him I was the
devil
myself
. He took me to be in
earnest
,
I
suppose
; that is all.
Aye, and ye are the deel,
said
Duncan.
Put out your foot here, and let us
see
if it
hae a cloven place i' the middle o't, or be
like a
christian
's foot; or try if ye can
stand
till I
say
the Lord's prayer; though I wad
na
wish
to
say
it, as I dinna ken but ye wad
take the man's
house
wi' ye, and leave the
Captain, and this gentleman without a
chamber to gae to bed in.
PshaDuncan
,
said
the Captain; how can
such
ideas come into
your brain? I
see
nothing, but the
gentleman's
servant
. It is the prejudice of your
education, to
suppose
that the devil can
take the
shape
of men, or tangible
substance
;
at
least
that he can eat food, and
converse
with a human voice, You will
come by and bye to have a better
sense
of
things. In the mean time we
must
excuse
your revereis, as you are but a late
emigrant
.
This valet may be
indiscreet
, or
as you would
say
, profane, in his
expresions
;
a thing of which I will venture to
say
this gentleman,
whose
waiting man
he is, does by no means approve.
Nevertheless
,
I cannot think he is
Apolyon
,
or Belzebub, or Satan, or the great
arch devil of the infernal regions I do
not even believe that he is one of your
inferior devils, that has
assumed
the
shape
and function of a valet, and has
sat
down
here to eat his
supper
in the kitchen.
I am not one one of
those
,
said
the
gentleman
,
that approve of profane language,
or the undervaluing the religious
ceremonies
of a
conscientious
, though weak
man; but it would appear to me that this
is but an affair of humour on the part of
my valet, who by the by is but hired with
me as a waiting man, and I have no
controul
over him, farther than to
dismiss
him
for improper conduct. He is a merry
fellow
;
but I have always found him faithful,
and of good temper;
so
that I will venture
to
say
, that if Duncan, for that I
understand
is the name of this North Briton, will take
supper
, and go to bed with him, he will
receive
no injury whatever.
I wad na take the whole town o' Perth,
to
sit
down wie him,
said
Duncan; nor a'
the kingdom of Scotland to
sleep
wie him
ae
Vol. IV. C
ae night. I
should
expect nothing
else
but
to be i' the lake o'
brimstane
before the
morning.
I will be damn'd
said
Roderick, if I do
you any damage. I am no devil more than
yourself
. It was to get quit of your long
prayers before victuals, that led me to talk
as I have done.
Do you hear him,
said
Duncan? would
any body but the deel, acknowledge
himself
willing to be dam'd, or talk about it
in
sae
light a manner. He confirms by ae
breath, what he denies by the other. He
is the deel, as
sure
as ever Mitchel Scot
was in Scotland, or if he is na the deel;
he is as bad as the deel, and it gaes
against
the grain wi' me to hae ony
communication
wi' him. Let him gae to hell for me
by himself. He
sal
not hae my company.
I wad na
trust
but that he wad hae an
hundred witches here about the
house
,
before
the morning, and put every one o' us
on a
broomstick
to ride along wi' him,
taking
the taps aff the trees, and dinging
floon
houses
, as he gaes along; the auld
woman turning
themselves
into cats, as
they like, or taking the
shapes
o' hares, or
swimming
o'er rivers in their egg-
shells
.
The Captain finding that it was in vain
to
to attempt by direct means to overcome the
force of prejudice, changed his language,
and affected to
suppose
that the valet might
be the devil, and
proposed
to examine the
extremity of both limbs, to
see
whether he
had a cloven foot. The valet,
summitting
to
the
jest
, agreed to be examined. His
boots and
stockings
therefore being
stripped
off, his feet were examined, and no
sissure
appeared more than in a common
foot. Now,
said
the Captain, if he can
stand
the recital of a prayer, will you not
acknowledge that he may be a human
person
.
Ay, if 'twere a
minister
,
said
Duncan
;
but I dinna ken, if the prayer o' a
layman
,
can affect him much. But it does
na matter muckle, whether he is the devil
or not; he is
amaist
as bad as the devil,
as you may
distinguish
by his
conversation
,
and I dinna care to ha muckle more to do
wie him.
That is, devil or no devil,
said
the
Captain, you will neither eat nor
sleep
with
him.
Just
the
short
and the lang o' it,
said
Duncan. I will take a bit o' bread and
beef in my hand, and creep into
some
nuke by
mysel
, if it
should
be i' the
stable
with the
horses
, rather than wie this wicked
crea
creature, that if he is not Satan, has a great
resemblance
o' him.
With this the Captain and the
gentlemen
,
left them to
themselves
, and
returned
to the chamber.
CHAP. IV.
IN the morning it appeared that
Duncan
had
sat
up the greater part of the
night, with a candle burning by him in
the kitchen, until near day-light; when
overcome with
sleep
he had reclined upon
a bench, until the gentleman and his
valet
had departed, and the Captain had got
up, which was about an hour after
sunrise
.
Having
breakfasted
, which was
about
9 o'clock, they
set
out upon their
travels
,
conversing
as they went along upon
subjects
that occurred. The
first
topic was
a
comparison
of Scotland with this
country
;
in what particulars each had the
advantage
of the other. Duncan gave a
decided
preference in all things to the
trans-Atlantic
region; and found nothing on this
con
continent that could encounter the
smallest
competition. I
should
presume
,
said
the Captain, we have more timber in this
country than in yours. You may have
more, but not half
sae
guid,
said
Duncan
.
Our fir, is far better than the oak
that ye find here. I will allow you the
advantage in one particular,
said
the
Captain
;
you are more
closely
settled
, and the
soil
of
course
must
be under a more
general
cultivation. Aye, but that is nathing,
said
Duncan; it is
settled
wi' a better
stock
o' people; and we hae dukes and
lairds amang us; no as it is here, where
ye may gae a day's journey, and no hear
of a piper at a great
house
, or
see
a
castle
;
but a' the folks, and their
habitations
,
luking
just
for a' the warld like our
cotters in Scotland. But,
said
the
Captain
,
what do you think of the works of
nature here, the
sun
and moon for
instance
?
The
sun
is a very guid
sun
,
said
Duncan; but he has o'er muckle heat in
the middle of the day. I wad like him
better if he wad draw in a little of it at
this
season
, and let it out i' the winter,
when we
sal
hae more need o' it. But as
to the moon, Duncan,
said
the Captain,
you have
seen
it
since
you came in; do
you
C 2
you think it is as large as the moon in
Scotland? I dinna ken, quoth Duncan,
but it is
amaist
as large; but it changes
far aftener, and it is no
sae
lang at the
full as it is in our kintry. But what think
you of the
stars
, Duncan; you have
taken
notice of them, I
presume
, in this
hemisphere
.
The
stars
dinna differ muckle
frae the
stars
at hame, quoth Duncan;
save
that there are not
sae
many o' them.
Wi' us, the firmament is a' clad wi' them,
like
brass
buttons; they light it up
just
like candles. But here they luke blaite,
and hae a watery appearance in the night,
as if they had got the fever and ague o'
the climate, and were
sickly
, and had na
strength
to put forth their fire. I tell
you, captain, there is nothing here
equal
to what it is in Scotland. How could
you expect it; this is but a young
kintra
.
It will be a lang time before it comes
to
sik
perfection as wi' us; and I dinna
ken if it ever does.
How comes it to
pass
, Duncan,
said
the
Captain that the devil
chuses
the women
of your country, in preference to any
other
,
to make witches of? For it would
seem
to be the
case
; as I have heard more
of
of Scotch witches, than of
English
or
American
.
I can gie ye a good
reason
for that,
said
Duncan. The deel kens weel enough
where to find out the
best
materials. The
English
women are no worth making
witches of; they could do him little guid
when he had them. Ane Scotch witch is
worth a dozen
English
, or American.
They can loup farther, and
sink
a
ship
in
half the time.
The Captain having made this
experiment
of the national partiality of Duncan,
was
satisfied
; and turned the
conversation
to another
subject
.
CHAP
CHAP. V.
I Shall not
stop
to record the minute
incidents
that took place in the
course
of
this day's travel; or that of the two
following
days; or relate the particulars of the
conversation
of the Captain with Duncan,
or of Duncan with any other
person
. What
I have related, was chiefly with a view to
give
some
idea of the new valet's character
and manners.
I think it was the fourth day after
leaving
the city, that the Captain
casting
up
his eyes at a place where there was a
considerable
length of
straightroad
before him,
saw
a
person
trudging on foot, who by his
make and gait, appeared to him to
resemthe
new revenue officer, the quondam
bog-trotter
.
Duncan,
said
the Captain, if that
man was not on foot, that is before us, I
should
take him for Teague O'Regan, the
waiting man that was in my
service
, and
who gave place to you; having obtained
a
a
commission
in the revenue, and become
an
excise
officer. But as I had equipped him
with a
horse
, it is not probable that he
could be without one already, and have
taken to his trotters, after being advanced
to be a limb of the government. It would
be a degradation to the dignity of office.
I dinna think, quoth Duncan, there is
muckle dignity in the office. What is he
but a gauger? that is of na more
estimation
in our kintra than a hangman. There is na
ane that can live in an
honest
way without
it, will take the
commission
. Duncan,
said
the Captain, it is not
so
in this country,
where the government is a republic; and
all taxes being laid by people, the
collection
of every
species
is a
sacred
duty, and
equally
honourable.
Honour! quoth Duncan. Do you talk
of honour in a gauger? If that be the way
of thinking in this kintra, I
wish
it were
back in Scotland. Every thing
seems
to
be
orsa
versa
here; the wrang
side
uppermost
.
I am but a
simple
waiting man to a
gentlemen like
yoursel
, and I wad na
take the office o' gauger upon me, for a'
Philadelphia, which is
amaist
as big as
Perth.
By this time they were within a
small
dif
distance
of the traveller, whom the
Captain
reconnoitering more perfectly,
discovered
absolutely
to be Teague. The
revenue
officer, turning round, he
recognized
the Captain, and
accosted
him: By
my
shoul
, and there he is, his honour
himself
;
the Captain, and a new
sharvant
that
he has trotting on foot, as I
myself
used
to
do. And as you
seem
to do yet, Teague,
said
the Captain. What is become of the
horse
I
furnished
you? Has he been
stolen
, or
has he
strayed
away from
some
pasture
in
the
course
of your
progress
? By my
shoul
,
said
the officer, neither the one nor the
oder of
dese
happened; but I met wid a
good affer on de road, and I took it. I
swaped
him for a watch dat I have in my
pocket here.
Bless
de
sweet
little
shoul
of
it: It tells de hour of de day, and what
time of de clock it is,
slapeing
or waking;
and in de night time you have but
just
to
look at the face of it, and de
sweet
pretty
figures dat are dare, and you will know how
long it is before the morning come. Not
like de dumb
beast
, that could not
answer
you a word in the night nor in the day;
but hold his tongue like a
shape
, and
say
nothing; while dis little watch, as de call
it, can
speak
like a
Christian
creature, and
keep
keep company along de road like a living
person
. It was for dat
reason
dat I took
it from a country man dat I met wid
last
night at the tavern; and am now going on
by
myself
, and have no
horse
to take care
of, and plague me on de road, and give
me falls over his tail, and over his mane,
up hill and down hill,
so
dat I
almost
broke
my neck, and thought it
safest
to ride
upon
my foot. Dat is truth,
master
Captain.
But who is dis
son
of a whore dat you have
wid you trotting in my place? Does he take
good care of your creature at night, and
clean your boots. I would be after bidding
him
smell
dis cudgel here dat I walk wid,
if he neglect a good
master
, as your
honour
is.
The blood of Duncan was up at the idea
of being cudgelled by an
excise
officer;
and
stepping
up to Teague he lifted a
cudgel
on his part. Ye cudgel me,
sirrah
!
said
the Caledonian. If it was na for his
honour's
presence
, I wad lay this rung on
your hurdies; or gie ye a rap upon the
crown; to talk
sik
language to your
betters
.
I
should
make ye ken what it is to
raise
the blood of a Scotchman. You ca'
yourself
a revenue officer. But what is
that but a guager? which is the next to a
hang
hangman in our kintra. Captain, will ye
stand
by and
see
fair play, till I gie him his
paikes for his impertinence. My lug for
it, I
sal
make this rung rattle about the
bones o' his head to
some
tune.
With that Duncan was making his
advance
,
having
raised
his cudgel, and
puting
himself
in the attitude of a
person
accustomed
to the back
sword
; which
Teague
on the other hand
observing
,
accosted
him with
softer
words; not
disposed
to
risk
an engagement with an unknown
adversary
.
Love your
shoul
,
said
he, if I was
after affronting you more than his honour
my
master
; burn me, if I don't love you,
just
because
you are my
master
's
sharvant
,
and takes care of his
baste
. I was only
jokeing. It is
just
the way I would
spake
to my own dear
cousin
Dermot, if he were
here; for in Ireland we always
spake
backwards
.
Put up your
stick
, dear honey, I
am
sure
the Captain knows that I was
always
good-natured, and not given to
quarrels
;
though I could fight a good
stick
too
upon a pinch; but it never came into my
head to wrangle with my
master
's
sharvant
,
especially
such
a tight good looking fellow
as
yourshelf
, dat has a good
shelalah
in your
hand
hand, and is fitter to beat than to be
beaten
,
by
shaint
Patrick.
Duncan,
said
the Captain, you have
heard the explanation of the
hasty
words
the revenue officer at
first
used
; and it
would
seem
to me, that,
consistently
with
the reputation of courage, and good
breeding both, you ought to be
satisfied
.
I dinna ken, quoth Duncan; it was a
vera great provocation to talk o'
cudgeling
;
and it may be the
custom
o' a
friendly
salutation
in Ireland, but no in our
kintra
.
While I ha a drop o' the blood o' St.
Andrew in me, I wad na gae up to
sik
civilities
.
Said the Captain, as far as I can have
understood
, St. Patrick and St. Andrew
were
cousins
, and you his
descendants
or
disciples
ought to be on terms of amity.
St. Andrew a
cousin
to St. Patrick!
said
Duncan. I canna acknowledge that,
Captain. St. Andrew was a guid
Protestant
,
and a Covenanter, but St. Patrick
was a
Papist
, o' the kirk o' Rome; and
did na keep the
second
commandment, but
worshipped
graven images, and pictures o'
saints
; and tuke the
sacrament
wie a
wafer
.
I
shall
never gie up that, Captain,
that St. Patrick was o' kin to St. Andrew.
They
Vol. IV. D
They might be i' the
ministry
at the
same
time; but there is a great difference in their
doctrine. Did ye e'er ready any o' the works
o' John Knox, Captain? Dinna ye ken,
that the church of Rome is the whore o'
Babylon? If ye had lived in the time o' the
persecution
, ye wad na hae compared a
Scotch
saint
wie a
Irish
priest
.
Said the Captain, I have no particular
acquaintance with the
distinguishing
renets
of the two
Evangelists
; nor do I know
any
thing of them,
save
just
to have
understood
that the one had planted
Christianity
in Scotland and the other in Ireland. But
this is not a point
so
material to us
individually
,
as that we cultivate peace, and
have no difference. I
must
therefore
enjoin
it on you, Duncan, that you drop
your
stick
, and keep the peace towards the
revenue officer on the high way, that he
may not be delayed in going forward to
enter
on the functions of his office. Said
Duncan, Since your honour
says
the word,
I
shall
lay down my
stick
; for I ken the
law better than to
stand
out
against
the
civil
authority.
But Teague,
said
the Captain, how can
you
distinguish
the figures of your watch,
so
as to tell the hours of the day; you that
do
do not
understand
figures? By my
shoul
,
said
Teague, and I never tought of dat.
Will not the figures
spake
for
demselves
,
when I look at dem. I am
sure
, I
saw
the
son
of a whore dat I got her from, look
at her, and tell the hour o' de day, like a
pracher at his books; and I am
sure
and
certain, dat
such
an ill-luking teef as he
was, could neither read nor write. But by
my
shoul
, if dat is de way, dat I have to
read de marks
myself
, I will
swap
her back
for a
horse
or a cow, on de road; or for
something
else
, dat will
plase
your honour
better;
so
dere is no harm done,
plase
your honour, while we are in a
christian
country, and can meet wad good paple to
spake
to, and take a watch or a colt off
our hands, when we mane to part wid it,
plase
your honour.
Such was the
conversation
at the
first
interview of the Captain's family, to
use
a military
stile
; and may be
considered
as
a
sample
of that which took place in the
sequel
of this day's travel, as they
proceeded
together until noon; when they
came to dine at a public
house
, and
umbrage
was taken by Duncan,
because
the
Captain had permitted Teague to
sit
at
table
with
himself
; which he did in
respect
to
to the office which he held, and in order
to
support
its dignity. Captain,
said
Duncan
,
coming to the hall door, and
looking
in, d'ye permit an
excise
officer to
sit
at the table wie your honour. For
sik
profanation I never heard o' in a' my
born days; if it were in Scotland, it
wad
cause
a
sight
to the whole
neighbourhood
.
Does your honour ken that he is
an
excise
officer? Duncan,
said
the
Captain
,
it is a principle of good
citizenship
,
especially
in a republican government, to
pay
respect
to the laws, and maintain the
honour of its officers. It is for this
reason
,
that I make it a point to honour one who
was lately my bog-trotter; not that I
discern
in him any remarkable improvement
in talents or manners; but
simply
because
the government has
discovered
something
;
and has
seen
fit to give him a
commission
in the revenue. Who knows but
it may be your own fortune, at no
distant
day to obtain an office, and will you not
think it
reasonable
then, that it
should
be
forgotten that you were once in the
capacity
of a waiting man; and that you
should
receive the
respect
and the precedence due
to your new dignity? it is not with us as
in monarchies, where the advance is
gradual
dual
in
most
cases
; though even there, an
individual through the favour of the
prince, or of the queen, or of a lady or
gentleman of the court, may have a
sudden
promotion: but in a free
state
, what
hinders that the
lowest
of the people
should
be taken up, and made
magistrates
, or put
into
commissions
in the revenue? I
must
insist
, Duncan, that you retire to the
kitchen
,
and take your dinner, and make
no
disturbance
in the
house
at this time;
you will come to
understand
better the
nature of offices in
these
commonwealths
in due time. Duncan retired; but in
soliloquy
expressing
his chagrin, at the
strange
reversion
of affairs in America, from what
they were in Scotland; and his
mortification
at finding
himself
in the
service
of a
master
, that could degrade
himself
by
dining
with an
excise
officer.
Teague, on the other hand, though he
was
silent
in the hearing of Duncan, broke
out as
soon
as he had
shut
the door;
Captain
,
said
he,
plase
your honour, where did
you pick up dat teef-luking
son
o'd a
whore, dat has no more manners, dan a
shape
-
stealer
in Ireland; or a merchant
dat
sells
yarn at a fair. By
saint
Patrick,
if your honour had given me leave in de
road
D 2
road, I would have knocked his teet down
his troat; and if your honour will
excuse
de table, I will go out and take him by
de troat, and make him talk to
himself
like a frog in de wet
swamps
; de
son
of
a whore, to
spake
to your honour wid a
brogue upon his tongue, in
such
words
as defe.
By the brogue, Teague meant the
Scottish
dialect, which Duncan
used
.
Teague,
said
the Captain, the
prejudices
of education
must
be tolerated, until
time and experience of the world, has
lessened
or removed them. He is an
honest
fellow, and I have more confidence in
him, than I ever had in you, though his
talents have not appeared equal; at
least
if I am to judge from the
estimate
made
of you, by
these
who have a better right
to judge than I have. However, I am
unwilling
to have any
disturbance
between
you, and therefore,
must
insist
that you
leave him to the reprimands which I
myself
have
occasionally
given him, and
shall
continue to give him, until he attains a
better knowledge of the nature of things
in this new
hemisphere
,
so
different from
those
to which he has been
accustomed
.
This put an end to any altercation
between
tween
the two, the revenue officer and the
waiting man, for the remaining part of
that day, as they trudged together, until
they came to the inn at night, and having
supped
, were about to go to bed. It was
what in
some
places is called an
Ordinary
;
that is, an indifferent tavern, of but
mean accommodations. The
house
was
small
, and there was but two beds for the
reception of
strangers
; one of
these
so
indifferent
,
as to appear fit only for the
servant
of a gentleman, who might happen to
travel the road, though large enough to
contain two, or three
persons
. What it
wanted in quality of
neatness
, and perhaps
cleanliness
, was made up in
dimensions
.
This bed therefore
seemed
naturally to
invite
the reception of two of the company.
Teague,
said
the Captain, when about
to go to bed, I think Duncan and you,
being
the younger men, may pig in together
in that large bed, and leave the other to
me who am an older man, and am apt to
tumble and
toss
a little, from
weariness
in
my ride; and may perhaps
disturb
you in
your
sleep
.
Guid deliver me,
said
Duncan, frae
sik
a profanation o' the name o'
Ferguson
,
as to
sleep
wi' an
excise
officer. I
am
am na o' a great family, but I am come o' a
guid family; and it
shall
never be
said
that
I came to America to
disgrace
my lineage,
by
sik
contact as that. Gae to bed wi' an
excise
officer! I wad
sooner
gae to bed out
o' doors; or i' the
stable
amang the
horses
.
The revenue officer was affronted at
this; and gave way to his indignation.
The devil burn me,
said
he, if I will be
after
slapeing
wid you, you
son
of a whore,
you teef luking vagabon; wid de itch
upon
your back; I am
sure
all your country
has de itch; and keep
scratching
and
scratching
, as if de ware in hell, and could
get
brimstone
for noting; you
son
o'd a
whore.
The youke!
said
Duncan. Do you
impeach
me wi' the youke?
You impatche
yourself
,
said
the
revenue
officer. Did not I
see
you
scratching
as you came along de road; and do you
tink, you teef, dat I with to get de
leprosy
,
or de
scurvy
, and have to
sleep
in a
bag o'
brimstone
two or tree weeks,
before
I be fit to travel wid his honour the
Captain again?
The deel damn me,
said
Duncan, if I
can bear that.
What,
swear
, Duncan?
said
the
Captain
,
or
curse
rather; you that are a
Covenanter
,
and have religious books in your
wallet, the
Confession
of Faith and the
Catechisms
!
How can I help it, man,
said
Duncan.
The deel rive his
saul
, but I man be at
him.
Duncan had by this time
seized
his
walking
staff
, and put
himself
in an
attitude
to attack his
adversary
, who on the
other hand had,
instinctively
,
ensconced
himself
behind the Captain, and
opposed
him as a rampart to the fury of the Scot.
Duncan,
said
the Captain, you are in the
wrong on this
occasion
, you gave the
asfront
,
and ought to
excuse
the revenue
officer
for what he has
said
, which, by the
bye, was not
justifiable
, on any other
ground but that of provocation. For
national
reflections are at all times
reprehensible
.
But in order to
compose
this matter,
and that we may have no further
disturbance
,
I will take the large, though more
humble bed my
self
, and
sleep
with the
excise
officer, for the reputation of the
government who has thought proper to
appoint him to this
trust
.
The deel take me if ye
shall
do that,
Captain,
said
Duncan; I wad rather take
the
the
stain
upon
mysel
, than let my liege be
disgraced
; for it wad come a' to the
same
thing in the end, that I had been the
waiting
man o' ane that had been the bed
fellow
o'a gauger. O! guid keep us, how that
would found in Scotland. What wad my
relation Willy
Ferguson
, that is
professor
i' the high college o' E'nburgh,
say
to
that? But rather than your honour
shou
'd
take the
stain
upon you, I
sal
put up wie
it for a night; though if the landlady
has a pickle
strae
, and a blanket, I wad
rather lie by the fire
side
, than
contaminate
mysel
, beding wi'
sik
a bog-trotting
loon as he is, that wad gae into
sik
an
office for the
sake
o' filthy lucre, and to
make a living; when there are many
honest
means to get a
support
other ways.
The landlady gave it to be
understood
that
she
could
furnish
him with a bag of
straw
and a blanket.
This
adjusted
the difficulty, and
saved
the delicacy of the Scotchman, and
embarrassment
of the Captain, in keeping peace
between the bog-trotters; as in reality they
both were, though the one had obtained
a
commission
, and the other remained a
private
person
.
CHAP
CHAP. VI.
IN
the
course
of the three following days,
during which the Captain and the two
bog trotters, journeyed together, a great
deal of ill will
shewed
itself
between the
undertrappers
. By the bye, I
ask
pardon
,
before I go farther, of the
government
,
for thus confounding the revenue
officer with the
present
waiting man; but
I aver, that it is not owing to any
disrespect
of the government, though it may have
that appearance; but is to be
resolved
simply
into the force of habit which I acquired
in
designating
O'Regan in the early part
of this narrative, before he was advanced to
office; and
since
that, to the
impression
made upon my mind,
occasionally
by his
conduct, which has not intirely
corresponded
with the dignity of the
commission
.
When
instances
occur of this nature, I fall
involuntarily into the
use
of the former
epithet, which reflection,
doubtless
, would
teach
teach me to
discard
. This is my apology;
and if it
should
be attributed to any
secret
grudge, or
dislike
of public
measures
, or
persons
at the head of our affairs, it will
be a great
injustice
. But, as I was
saying
,
in the
course
of the following days,
much bickering took place between the
Hibernian and the Scotchman; or as I
might
otherwise
express
myself
, between
the
son
of St. Andrew, and St. Patrick.
The Scot thought the Hibernian
defective
in grace and manners; both
because
he did not
ask
a
blessing
to his food, and
because
he took the liberty to eat with the
Captain, and to
converse
with him as on
equal terms. Indeed it was the only fault
he found with the Captain
himself
, that
he did not
say
grace to meat, and that he
admitted the gauger to this enjoyment of
equality. He did not enter fully into the
necessary
policy of
observing
the forms of
respect
to officers of government, merely
for the
sake
of the authority, and as a
compliment to the laws
themselves
. Nor
was his knowledge of the human mind,
and the modes of acting,
sufficient
to
inform
him, that the
saying
grace at victuals
is a matter of form, more than of faith;
and that for this
reason
,
some
christian
fects
sects
, particularly the people called
Quakers
,
omit it altogether.
The Hibernian would
sometimes
beat
off, to
use
a nautical
phrase
, and
disarm
his
adversary
by
expressions
of benevolence,
as Love your
shoul
, &c.;
sometimes
he
would prepare for battle, and be
disposed
to defend
himself
; on which
occasions
it
behoved the Captain to interfere, and
break off the
contest
.
The Captain, at length, weary of this
trouble, thought of the expedient of
dismissing
the revenue officer a day or two a
head, in order that he might be apart from
the other bog trotter. This being done,
with exhortation that he would go lorward
speedily
, and open an office in the
district
,
the Captain propofed to remain a day at
the public
house
where he then was, in
order to give the revenue officer the
advantage
of the
start
I have mentioned. In
the mean time, hearing of a cave in the
neighbourhood, which was thought to be
a great
curiosity
, he took the opportunity
of
visiting
it. The guide led them to it,
I mean the Captain and his waiting man,
in about an hour's walk from the public
house
. It was on the bank of a
small
river
;
the mouth of the cave opening to the
bank
Vol. IV. E
bank. A
small
stream
issued
from the
cave, and fell into the river, with a fall
of a few feet over a rock, rendered
smooth
by the current of the water. Above this,
was a
shade
of
spreading
beech, with thick
foliage, and beneath, towards the
strand
of the river, was a gradual
descent
with
washed
pebbles, and a clear filtrating
sand
.
Hard by the fall of this water, and on the
strand
of the river, the attention of the
Captain was attached by certain rude
sculptures
,
observable
on a flat rock; and
also
by others on a perpendicular one,
that
composed
a part of the bank. There
was the figure of the tarapin, the bear, the
turkey, &c. It was a
subject
of reflection
with the Captain, whether
these
impressions
had been made by the animals
themselves
,
while the rock had been in a
plastic
state
,
and before it had hardened from clay into
stone
; or whether it was the work of the
savages
, before the Europeans had
possession
of the country. He lamented that he
had not a
philosopher
at hand, to
determine
this. On the bank above, and
toward
the mouth of the cave, were a
number
of petrefactions to be found; the
water
that ran here, appearing hence to have
a petrifying quality. The Captain
considering
deri
these
, was thinking with
himself
how good a
school
this would have been
for Teague, had he been admitted a
member
of the
Philosophical
Society, as had
been
proposed
at an early period.
The mouth of the cave, was of a height
and width to receive a man walking
upright
,
and without
constraint
on his
entrance
;
after a
passage
of a few yards, lined
with the
solid
rocks, it opened into an
apartment
of about eighteen feet cube. The
oozing from above formed the
stalactites
,
and would probably in the
course
of a
century
or two, fill up this chamber
altogether
,
unless
by digging above, the
course
of
the water could be diverted from the roof,
and carried off by a conduit on a
solid
part of the mountain. The floor of the
chamber had been
raised
by the
pretrifaction
of the water; as appeared from the
inequality of
surface
, formed by the
stalactites
,
and from the
testimony
of the
guide, who remembered the time, not
more than fifteen years ago, when the
descent
to this apartment, was a
step
of at
least
a foot from the level of the entrance.
Passing
on a few yards more, they
descended
a
step
, and came to a
second
apratment
,
of a greater extent, and of not less
than an hundred feet to the level vault.
Here was a
vast
bed of human
skeletons
petrified, but
distinguishable
by their
forms. No doubt it had been a
repository
of
savage
chiefs,
whose
bodies, converted
into
stone
by the virtue of this water,
were
preserved
more durably than the
mummies of Egypt. The
dimensions
of
some
of the
skeletons
bespoke
them giants;
that of one
measured
eight feet, wanting
an inch. Duncan,
said
the Captain, I
doubt much whether there have been larger
giants in Scotland. Aye have there, half
as large again,
said
Duncan; from the
stones
that are put up in
some
castles
, there
must
have been men at
least
eighteen or
twenty feet in height. What can have
become
of this breed?
said
the Captain. They
have fought wi' ane another, 'til they are
a' dead,
said
Duncan. This was the
easiest
way of accounting for the
loss
.
There was an
ascent
of a
step
or two to
the next apartment, which was of an oval
form, the conjugate diameter of which
was about thirty feet, and the
transverse
twenty five. There were the bows and
arrows
,
all petrified, that
these
warriors had
used
in life. The water
descended
not in
drops, but through the fine pores of the
rock
rock in a gentle dew, and with an
impression
of extreme cold,
so
as to endanger
life, and probably convert the human
body
into
stone
in a very
short
space
of time.
The guide thought it not
advisable
to
remain
long, and Duncan was anxious to
return; the forms of the dead in the
chamber
behind him leading him to apprehend,
that
some
of their
shades
might come after
them, to enquire the
occasion
of their
visit
.
Regaining the entrance of the cave, and
emerging into light, I mean the light of
day, for they had entered with torches,
they left the place, and returned to the
tavern.
The day following, they paid another
visit
to the cave, and
observed
in the
chamber
of bows and arrows, a pool of limpid
water, into which looking, they
discovered
arrow heads, and hatchets of
stone
innumerable. They took out, and brought
away
some
of them.
These
had no doubt
been
first
formed in wood, and then put
in this water to petrify, and become fit
for
use
. Thus we
easily
account for the
formation of
such
implements; whereas
the idea of being formed out of a
stone
,
in the
first
instance
, by the dint of human
labour, and with no other
instruments
than
E 2
than
stone
itself
, involves great difficulty.
This
discovery
, the Captain, I
presume
,
lost
no time in communicating to the
Philosophical
Society, as will in due time
appear
,
from a publication of their
transactions
.
Near the entrance, and on the right,
was the
passage
to what is called the
petrified
grove. This, on their return they
entered, and in about thirty
steps
, found
themselves
in a
spacious
square
, which
appeared
to have been once the
surface
of
the earth: For here was trees in their
natural
position
, with
wasps
nests
on
them, all petrified; and buffaloes
standing
under, in their proper form, but as
hard as adament. A bleak wind, with a
petrifying dew, had
arrested
them in life,
and fixed them to the
spot
; while the
mountain in a
series
of ages, had grown
over them. That which
struck
the
Captain
most
, was an Indian man reduced to
stone
, with a bundle of peltry on his back.
If the
virtuosi
of Italy, could have
access
to this vault, there would be danger of
them robbing it of
some
of
these
figures,
in order to compare with the
statues
that
have been made by hands. When this
cave
shall
have gained due celebrity, there
is
is no
qestion
, but that attempts of this
nature will be made. I
submit
therefore,
whether it would not be
adviseable
for the
connoisseurs
of America, to apply to the
legislature
of the
state
, where the cave is,
to prevent
such
exportation.
The Captain leaving this place, took
nothing
with him but the
skin
of a wild cat,
which hung upon a
stone
peg in the
side
of
the grotto, and which he broke off, by
giving it a
sudden
jerk as he turned
round. Duncan took a petrified turtle,
which he thought
resembled
a highland
bonnet, and
said
he would
scrape
it out,
and
send
it for a
curiosity
to Perth.
CHAP
CHAP. VII.
Containing
Observations
.
It may be
observed
, that as I advance in
my book, I make fewer chapters, by
way of commentary, and occupy
myself
chiefly with the narrative. It is the
characteristic
of old age, and may be decorous
towards the
conclusion
of the work.
Nevertheless
,
I
shall
arrest
myself
here a little,
to reflect on one particular of the
discoveries
of the Captain; the
sculpture
on the
rocks, which appeared to be the labour of
the
aborigness
of this country. I have
not
seen
these
sculptures
, for I have not
had an opportunity of
visting
this cave;
but I have
seen
similiar
sculptures
, in
abundance
,
on the
west
of the Allegany
mountains. I recollect at an early period
to have heard it
said
, that Ferdinando Soto,
had been on the Ohio waters, and as high
as the mouth of the great Kenaway; and to
have
have heard it given as a proof of this, that
in a particular place near the mouth of
that river, the imperial eagle was to be
seen
engraven on a rock; the eagle which
was the
ensign
of the
Spanish
monarchy,
under Charles V,
also
emperor of
Germany
,
and the
successor
of the C
sars
. It
was added, on the
same
ground, that the
vestiges
of fortifications
discoverable
in
this country, were the remains of
Spanish
works, and encamping grounds, under
Soto. I had
understood
, that the great
Franklin had adopted this
hypothesis
with
regard to
these
forts, from the
sculpture
of the eagle. In the winter of the year
1787, I had the
happiness
to
converse
with that
sage
, and
amongst
a number of
questions
, which I had the
curiosity
, and
perhaps impertinence, to
ask
, I put this,
with regard to the Kenaway
sculpture
, and
the theory of the
vestiges
of forts in the
western
country. I found his ideas to be
as I had been informed, and have
stated
.
I was then in Philadelphia.
In the fall of this year, having
returned
to the
western
country, a
surveyor
who
had been engaged in
surveying
lands on
the Kenaway, being in my office on
some
business
, it occurred to me to interrogate
him
him on the
subject
of the
sculpture
. He
had
seen
the engraving, of what was
thought to be the eagle, but called it a
Turkey; which word no
sooner
strnck
my
ear, than all the
hypothesis
of the holy
Roman eagle, and Ferdinando Soto, fell
to the ground. It is a turkey, thought I,
which the fancy of the
virtuoso
and
antiquarian
,
has converted into the king of
birds.
Conversing
, with the
surveyor
, he gave
me an account more minutely of this, and
other figures cut upon the rock, viz. the
turkey with its wings
spread
, as if
just
alighting
;
the deer with his branching
horns; and the
savage
himself
, with a
large head and long limbs, rudely cut.
He added, that he had heard from a
hunter
whom he well knew, that there was a
rock with
similar
engravings on Cheat
river
,
a
small
distance
above where it falls
into the Monongahela; and
promised
to
bring this hunter to give me a
description
.
About a month afterwards, the
surveyor
brought the hunter to me, who
appeared
to have been
observant
, and to be
intelligent
.
He had
seen
the rocks near the
mouth of Cheat river. The following is
the memorandum that I took from him:
The
The turkey appears to have alighted
at the lower part of the rock, and ran up
to the top. You
see
the track, which it
leaves; the
stretched
back, and the body
thrown forward, as between flying and
running. There is the figure of a man,
with a large head, and horns, and a thin
skeleton
-like body. There are deer tracks
well cut. This rock
stands
on a bend of
the river; and the figures on the lower
end, which projects
most
, are defaced by
the water, which
rises
to this height in the
time of floods. There is a
horse
track.
This is the only thing that I think
remarkable
,
if it is a
horse
track; for, as I do not
know that there were any
horses
here,
before
the European
settlements
, it would
argue that this engraving had been done
since
, and by the natives who have come
from the
Chesapeek
, and had
seen
horses
.
The
settlement
made by Captain Smith at
the mouth of James river, Virginia, was
I believe the
earliest
made, contiguous to
this country.
This hunter gave me to
understand
, that
he had
seen
a rock,
sculptured
in like
manner on the Kenaway, about eighty
miles from its mouth; that is nearly in a
line
line directly
west
from the rocks on Cheat
river.
Having been led into the way of
enquiring
on this
subject
, I have found that
these
engravings are very common throughout
the whole
western
country; that they are
discernible
all along the Ohio, at low
water
especially
, when the horizontal rocks
are left bare; that they are found on the
margins of the
smaller
streams
also
.
I had heard of one of
these
on the
Monongehela
,
about forty miles above
Pittsburgh
,
and in the
summer
of 1793,
crossing
the country near that place, I
spent
a
part of a day, in going out of my
course
to
observe
it. The
sculptures
were of the
same
kind, and
answer
the
description
before
given of
those
elsewhere
. The
figures
on this are, a bear rudely or rather
clumsily
cut; a hawk flying with a
snake
in its beak; the moon and the
seven
stars
;
a racoon; a human arm, and human feet,
well done; a buck with branching horns;
the turkey; and a number others. I want
no other proof that
these
sculptures
were
by the natives, than the form of the feet,
which are
unquestionably
Indian. The
narrowness
, and
smallness
of the heel
evinces
it. It might
also
be induced as a
pre
presumption
, that there are the
vestiges
of
a
sortification
,
such
as has been
mentioned
,
just
above on the hill. For it is
reasonable
to
suppose
, that
these
works of
leisure
and
taste
, were
most
likely to be
pursued
in the neighbourhood of
such
a work. But what has been at all times
conclusive
to me, that
these
engravings
are the works of the natives, is, the
circumstance
that no alphabetic mark of any
language, or Roman or Arabic numeral,
is found
amongst
any of
these
. For it is
well known, that it is a thing which would
occur to any European, who
should
amuse
himself
in this manner, to
impress
the
initials
at
least
of his name, and the digits of
the year. I had put this
question
to the
surveyor
and hunter, of whom I have
made mention, with regard to letters and
numeral marks, and found that none had
been
observed
by them, on the rocks which
they had
seen
. On that ground,
independent
of all others, I made the
deduction
I have
stated
.
I
consider
these
sculptures
, as the
sirst
rude
esseys
of the fine art of engraving;
and to have been the work of
savages
of
taste
,
distinguished
from the common
mass
,
by a talent to imitate in wood or
stone
,
the
Vol. IV. F
the forms of things innature, and a
capacity
of receiving
pleasure
from
such
an
application of the mental powers.
Whilst
a chief of genius, was waiting for the
assembling
of other chiefs, to hold a
council
;
or while the warrior was waiting at
a certain point for others, that were to meet
him, he may have
amused
himself
in this
manner; or it may have been the means
to cheat
weariness
, and
solace
the
intellectual
faculty, when there was no
counselling
in the nation, or wars to carry
on.
Happy
savage
, that could thus
amuse
himself
, and
exercise
his
first
preeminence
over animals we call
Beasts
. They can
hunt, and devour living things for food;
but where do you find a wolf, or a
fishing
hawk, that has any idea of
these
abstract
pleasures
, that feed the imagination? Why
is it that I am proud, and value
myself
amongst
my own
species
? It is
because
I
think I
possess
, in
some
degree, the
distinguishing
characteristic
of a man, a
taste
for the fine arts: a
taste
and
characteristic
too little valued in America, where a
system
of finance, has introduced the love
of unequal wealth;
destroyed
the
spirit
of common
industry
; and planted that of
lot
lottery in the human heart; making the
mass
of the people gamblers; and under
the idea of
speculation
,
sthrouded
engrossing
and monopoly every where.
It would
seem
, that the
sculptures
of
which I
speak
, are the works of more
ancient
savages
, than
these
which have
lately
occupied this country;
these
tribes not
being in the habit of making any
such
themselves
, and the figures evincing an
old date, being in
most
places, in
some
degree
essaced
, by the water of the river,
or the rain
washing
the rocks, on which
they are engraven. They would
seem
to
have been a more improved race, who had
given way to barbarians of the north, who
had over run the country. It is
generally
understood
, by the tradition of the
present
Indians, and the early French
writers, Charlevoix and others, that
about
the beginning of the
present
century,
the Six Nations conquered this country,
and expelled the former owners; and the
word Ohio, is
said
to mean Bloody, and
was the name given it from the blood
shed
upon its waters at that time.
The
sortifications
of which we
speak
,
must
have
also
been works of defence, of
that or an earlier period. From the trees
grow
growing upon the mound, or parapet of
these
, they
must
be
some
of them many
hundred years old.
It will
strike
the reflection, how was it
possible
for the human mind to remain
so
long in
so
low a
stage
of improvement, as
was the
casfe
with
these
, the aborigines of
this country. Perhaps the more puzzling
question
would be, whence the
spring
that
could have
sussicient
energy to
rouse
from
it. I
shall
leave this to
philosophy
, thought,
and
historical
deduction. Enough has
been
said
at
present
.
CHAP
CHAP. VIII.
ON the third day renewing their
journey
,
the
conversation
between the
Captain and his
servant
turned on the
character, and
history
of the
present
revenue
officer, the late Teague O'Regan.
The Captain gave Duncan a relation of
what had happened; in the
case
of the
attempt
to draw him off to the
Philosophical
Society, to induce him to preach, and even
to take a
seat
in the
legislature
of the
United
States; that had it not been for a
certain
Traddle, a weaver, whom they had been
fortunate enough to
substitute
for him,
the people would
most
undoubtedly have
elected Teague, and
sent
him to
Congress
.
Guid deliver us!
said
Duncan; do they
make Parliament men o' weavers i' this
kintra? In Scotland, it maun be a duke,
or a laird, that can hae a
seat
there.
This is a republic, Duncan,
said
the
cap
F 2
Captain; and the rights of man are
understood
,
and
exercised
by the people.
And if he could be i' the
Congress
, why
did ye let him be a gauger?
said
Duncan.
This is all the prejudice of education,
Duncan,
said
the Captain. An
appointment
in the revenue, under the executive
of the United States, ought not to have
disgrace
attached to it in the popular
opinion
;
for it is a
necessary
, and ought to
be held a
sacred
, duty.
I dinna ken how it is,
said
Duncan;
but I
see
they hae every thing tail
foremost
in this kintry, to what they hae in
Scotland
:
a gauger a gentleman; and
weavers
in the
legislature
.
Just
at this
instant
, was heard by the
way
side
, the jingling of a loom, in a
small
cabbin with a window towards the
road. It
struck
Duncan to
expostulate
with
this weaver, and to know why it was that
he
also
did not attain a
seat
in
some
public
body. Advancing to the orifice,
as it might be called, he applied his
mouth, and
bespoke
him, as he
sat
upon
his loom, thus: Traddle,
said
he, giving
him the
same
name that the Captain had
given the other; why is it that ye
sit
here,
treading
these
twa
stecks
, and playing wi'
your
your elbows, as ye throw the thread, when
there is one o' your occupation, not far
off, that is now a member of the
house
o'
lords, or commons, in America; and is
gane to the
Congress
o' the United States?
canna ye get
yoursel
elected; or it is
because
ye dinna offer, that ye are left
behind
in this manner. Ye
shud
be
striving
man, while guid
posts
are gaeing,
and no be
sitting
there wi' your
backside
on a beam. Dinna your neibours gie ya
a vote. Ye
shud
get a chapin o'
whiskey
,
man, and drink 'till them, and gar
them vote, or, ye
shoud
gae out and talk
politics, and mak
speeches
.
Such was the
address
of Duncan,
meaning
nothing more than to
amuse
himself
,
with the idea of a manufacturer
obtaining
a
seat
in the
legislature
, and making
laws
instead
of warping webs. But in
the mean time, the wife of the mechanic,
who had overheard the
conversation
, and
was
incensed
at an attempt to take her
husband
from his
business
,
seizing
a pot
stick
and running out, and turning the
corner of the
house
, laid a blow upon the
posteriors
of the orator; accompanying
her force with reproachful words to this
effect:
will
Will you never let the man alone,
said
she
, to mind his
business
, but be putting
these
notions in his head. He has been
once
constable
, and twice member of
assembly
;
and what has he got by it, but to
leave his
customers
at home, complaining
of their work not done? It is but little
good that has been got of him
these
three
years, but going to elections, and meetings,
and talking politics; and after all, what does
he know of
these
matters?
just
about as
much as my brown cow. A
set
of lounging
louts, coming here and taking up his time
with idle
nonsense
of what laws
should
be
made, and urging him to be elected; and
William Rabb's wife waiting for her
coverlet
this three months, and Andrew
Nangle
for his
shirt
cloth. It is enough to put a
woman in a
passion
that has the temper
of a
saint
, to have her man's head turned
so
from his own affairs, by idle
vagabonds
that come the way in this manner.
At this,
she
made another effort, and
springing
forward, was about to
impress
a
second
blow; when Duncan retreating, and
listing
up his
stick
in his turn
accosted
her
in
these
words: Gin ye were a man, as
ye are a muckle witch, I
shoud
be for
taking ye wi' this rung
across
your hurdies.
it
Is it any affront to have it evened to your
man Traddle, to gae to the
senate
, and to
get a
post
i' the government, and no be
knotting threads here, wi' his
shuttle
, like
a
tradesman
o'
Paisly
? Ye vile carlin, ye
maun be a witch, or a
warse
body, to take
a
stick
in your hand, like a driver o'
stots
,
and come pelmel, upon a man ahint his
back, when he is na
speaking
till ye.
Foul fa' me, but if it were na a
shame
to
battle wi' ane o' your
sex
, I wad break
your back with a lunder, before ye knew
what ye were about. To keep this
honest
man here,
shut
up like a
prisoner
under
ground, in a dungeon, drawing a reed
till him,
instead
o' throwing out his arms
like a Latin
scholar
, or a collegian, making
his oration to his hearers? Are ye chained
there, (turning his
speech
to Traddle,)
that ye
stay
sae
contentedly
yoursel
, man,
and dinna break out, and
escape
srae
the
fangs o' this witch.
This witch!
said
she
, (apprehending
danger
from a
second
address
to the weaver,)
this witch! I
shall
witch you to
some
purpose
, you vagabond. With this
she
made a
hasty
step
, and was nearly on the
back of the Caledonian, with her pot-
stick
,
having made a
stroke
at him, which be
eva
evaded, by taking to his heels, and
retreating
speedily
. The Captain in the
mean time had rode on, and left them to
compleat their dialogue.
CHAP. IX.
Duncan
had affected the wag on
the late
occasion
with the
manufacturer
and his wife, and had like to have
suffered
some
alloy of pain from the blows
which were inflictted, or were meditated.
But at the public
house
, in a village, a
little way ahead this day, where they
halted
about noon, a
circumstance
happened
which changed his view a little, and
disposed
him to
sadness
, rather than to play
the wag with his neighbours on the road.
While the Captain had reclined, and was
asleep
on a
sofa
, a
constable
had
apprehended
Duncan with a warrant;
commanding
this officer to take the
prisoner
before a
justice
of the peace, by whom it
had been
issued
. Duncan had taken for
granted, that it was the weaver's wife who
had made complaint, and
sent
after him,
on account of the threats he had made to
chas
-
chastise
her. The
bustle
in apprehending
him, had made a
noise
in the porch, and
awakened the Captain. Duncan,
said
he,
what is the matter? Lord deliver me,
said
he, if I ken. They
say
I am a
prisoner
.
The
baisiff
here has ta'en me wi' a warrant.
It maun be that witch the weaver's wife,
that has made a complaint,
just
because
I
was
jesting
a wee, about her
husband
gaeing
to the
legislature
; and
she
did na take it
weel, but
amaist
brake my back wi' her'
spurtle
; and now
she
has ga'en awa and
sworn
belike that I
strak
her; for this
is the way o'
these
witches, that they turn
states
evidence, and
swear
for
themselves
against
honest
people.
Duncan,
said
the Captain, this is what
comes of your meddling with politics. You
must
undertake to
say
forsooth
, who is
qualified to be a
representative
of the
United
States; you
must
insist
upon an
industrious
mechanic to
relinquish
his
occupation
;
and this not from any opinion of
his
fitness
for
such
appointment, or any
principle of love for the public good; but
merely for your
pastime
, and in ridicule
of a republican government in this
country
.
For though there have been
instances
of
chusing
weavers for the
legislature
,
and
and coblers, and coopers, why make a
burlesque
of this? Have not the people a
right to make
such
a choice? yet
because
these
things are not common in Scotland,
it
must
be the
subject
of a laugh here.
Had you been
serious
, there could have
been no fault found; but the
insult
lies in
your making a
jest
of it, which was evident
from your manner, in turning
aside
from
the highway to
address
a weaver through
the windos of a cellar; and in an abrupt
manner, to introduce an
expostulation
with him on the
subject
of election. No
wonder that the termagant his wife, who
did not
relish
the
proposition
, even in a
serious
point of view, was offended, and
disposed
to inflict blows; and, on the
resistance
made on your part, and threats
probably thrown out, has applied to a
justice
of the peace, and obtained a warrant
to commit you to the
custody
of the law.
What can they make o' it?
said
Duncan.
I do not know,
said
the Captain, what
offence it may be in law, but certainly it
was a great indecorum to
amuse
yourself
,
not at the expence of a mechanic, but
indirectly
at the whole body politic of the
union; not that I think it unbecoming to
send
such
as Traddle to deliberative
aemblies
;
blies;
but that you
seemed
to think it
so
;
because
it is a thing not known in
North-Britain
,
where
aristocratic
principles
prevail
.
You might have meant this as
pleasantry
;
but it may be
construed
a
reflection
upon a republican government,
and to
destroy
the rights of man, in the
first
germ and principles of their
existence
.
They canna make high
treason
o't
said
Duncan.
I do not know,
said
the Captain, what
a
strict
judge might make it, I
should
think
it could not be made a hanging matter.
However let us
see
the warrant, and
enquire
what the
justice
of the peace has
made of it.
I
shall
not
shew
the warrant to any man,
said
the
constable
, but to his
worship
,
justice
Underchin, to whom I
must
carry the
prisoner
immediately. So come along;
come along; the
justice
will
shew
you the
warrant.
There being no help for it, Duncan
was obliged to go along, the Captain
accompanying
him. Being brought before
the
justice
, Ah, have ye nabbed him?
said
his
worship
: I am glad ye have got him;
a great
rascal
.
There is no
question
,
said
the Captain,
step
Vol. IV. G
stepping
forward, and
addressing
the
justice
,
but the young man has acted with
considerable
imprudence; but ignorance of
the world, and
especially
of the laws and
customs
of America, has been the
principal
cause
of his
intrusion
. Though he has not been long in my
service
, yet I am
disposed
to
speak
with
some
confidence of
his civility in general. But, may it
please
your
worship
, in what
shape
have you
brought the charge. Is it an
assault
and
battery, or what?
I make it
bastardy
,
said
the
justice
; what
else
would I make it?
Bastardy
!
said
the Captain. It might
be fornication, or adultery; but how can
it be
bastardy
in
so
short
a time? It cannot
be a rape, that your
worship
means. There
was no rape, or fornication, or adultery in
the
case
, I will engage that. And how
can there be
bastardy
?
some
very hot
words
passed
between him and the woman,
and
strokes
might have been given; but
there was certainly no
disposition
, as far
as I could
see
, to beget
bastards
; nor was
there time for it. They were not in
such
a very loving humour, when I left them;
nor did he
stay
behind me above twenty
minutes on the road.
The
The
justice
was a little
swarthy
man, of
a corpulent habit,
seated
in an elbow
chair, with pen, ink, and paper on a
stand
by him. He threw
himself
back, as he
spoke
; leaned his head alternately on the
right and left
shoulder
, and bridled his
lips, as the
phrase
is,
discovering
in the
affectation
of his manner, great pride of
office
,
and apparent
satisfaction
in having
caught a criminal. Endeavouring to be
witty at the
embarraslsment
of the
present
culprit, and the
expressions
of the Captain,
why Mr.
said
he,
addressing
himself
, to
this
last
, though I do not know who you
are, that are
so
willing to
assist
me in the
examination of this vagrant, yet I will
observe
to you, that I make no doubt that
some
hot, or at
least
warm words, have
passed
between them; and
strokes
as you
call it, might have been given; but as to
the time of twenty minutes, or a larger
period
,
it is of no
consideration
in the law;
provided the woman
swears
, as this one
has done, that
she
is with child by him.
Nor will his ignorance of the
customs
of
America
,
excuse
him; we
must
commit
him, or bind him over, if he can find
security
,
to appear at the
sessions
, to take his
trial for the fornication.
Wi'
Wi' bairn!
said
Duncan. She might
just
as well have ta'en an oath, that I was
wi' bairn to her. Was na her man I
raddle
,
sitting
on his loom looking at us a'
the time. O the
false
jade! I get her wi'
bairn! I wad get a witch wi' bairn as
soon
.
It is extraordinary,
said
the Captain,
that
she
could be certain of her pregnancy
in
so
short
a time?
So
short
a time!
said
the
justice
, do
you call
six
months a
short
time?
It is not
six
hours,
said
the Captain,
nor the half of it,
since
the fracas
happened
.
Guid guide us!
said
Duncan, who was
standing
on the back ground, making his
soliloquy
; Guid guide us, that I
should
come
to America, to be tri'd for getting a
woman
wi' bairn. What will Mr. Dougal,
our
minister
think o' this? after ha'ing the
Confession
of Faith wi' me, and
sae
mony
guid bukes. Standing on the
stool
, is
bad enough; but nathing to the way they
hae i' this kintra, o' taking a man wi' a
bum, and bringing him before a
magistrate
;
just
the
same
thing as he ware a
sheep
-
stealer
. O' the
base
jade, to
swear
a bairn upon me; what will my ain folks
say
say
, when they hear o' it in Scotland? It
will be a
stain
upon a' my kin to the third
generation. It was the deel
himself
put it
in my head, to
stand
taking wi' a fool
weaver about his election. I
wish
I ware
in Perth again, and out o' a' this trouble.
Six hours!
said
the
justice
,
answering
to the Captain. Is it not
six
months,
Sampson
,
referring to the
constable
,
since
this
pedlar left this
settlement
? Pedlar!
said
the
Captain; he never was a pedlar; nor is it
six
months,
since
he left Scotland. He was
recommended to me by a gentleman whom
I knew very well, Mr. M`Donald, as a
lad
just
come over. So that it is
impossible
he could have been here
six
months ago.
I am no
sax
months frae Perth,
said
Duncan.
Is not your name, Ryburn,
said
the
justice
, and are you not that Scotch pedlar,
that was in this
settlement
two or three
months? Can there be any
mistake
?
referring
to the
constable
; is not this Niel
Ryburn
,
for whom the warrant calls? It is
the very man,
said
the
constable
. I knew
him by his dialect the moment I
saw
him
in the porch at the public
house
, talking
with the
hostler
. He has the
same
brogue
upon his tongue, and
says
Guid guide us,
just
G 2
just
in the
same
manner: only at that time
he
used
to
say
also
, By my fa'th, and by
my
sa
'l, more than he does at
present
. He
has become religious
since
, or pretends
to be
so
, in order to deceive your
worsship
.
But at that time, he had not much
religion
about him, and had no guid bukes as he
calls them in his pocket; but could damn
his
sa
'l, and
swear
like a devil.
Niel Ryburn!
said
the Captain, that is
not the name of my valet. It is that of
Duncan
Ferguson
. But pray who is the
woman that he is
said
to have got with child?
The weaver's wife is the only one that he
has had a
conversation
with to my
knowledge
;
and as I
said
before, they were not
much in the way of making love when I
left them.
A weaver's wife!
said
the
justice
; no,
Mr. M`Radin, or whatever
else
they may
call you; it is no weaver's wife; it is Kate
Maybone, that has made oath
against
him.
He had carnal knowledge of her about
six
months ago, when he was in this
settlement
pedling, and got her with child.
I perceive
said
the Captain, we are all
at
cross
purposes
, and under a
mistake
in
this
business
. This North Briton
Stop,
said
the
justice
, if you are to give
your
your
testimony
, Mr. with the cocked hat,
speaking
to the Captain; we
shall
take
it by
yourself
; and not let the pedlar hear
it, to enable him to frame his
story
to the
fame
purpose
.
Accordingly Duncan being withdrawn,
in the
custody
of the
constable
, the
Captain
was examined, and related the
particulars
on oath of all that he knew
respecting
the
prisoner
; and now being ordered
to withdraw, the
prisoner
was called in and
interrogated.
His
story
was to the
same
effect with
that of the Captain, and would
seem
to
distinguish
him from his countrymen
named
in the warrant; but his
Scottish
dialect
founded the
presumption
of identity
so
strongly
, that it was difficult, if not
impossible
,
to get over it.
I
see
,
said
the
justice
, that they have
framed their
stories
by
collusion
. They are
a couple of ingenious
rascals
; though the
one of them, the pedlar, affects great
simplicity
;
and the other vouches for him
that he is ignorant. I believe I
must
commit
them both; the one for
bastardy
, and
the other for
horse
-
stealing
. For the
circumstance
of having but one
horse
between
them, is extremely
suspicious
, and renders
it
it probable that they
must
have
stolen
that
one. The
story
which they tell, of having
come in company with a revenue officer,
whom they have
sent
a head on foot, is
absurd
,
especially
when you add what the
one who is called Captain tells, of this officer
having been once his
servant
, or
passed
for
such
, under the name of Teague
O'Regan
,
and bog-trotting as he calls it, in the
manner that this Duncan, which he
pretends
is the name, does now; and yet
even
then being likely to be taken from
him to preach, to go to
Congress
, and the
Lord knows what: It is
impossible
; it
must
be a
falsehood
; and the probability is, that
this fellow, this Captain, is the head of a
gang of
horse
-thieves; and this Scotch
pedlar
,
and the
Irish
revenue officer, are
Irih">Irish
revenue officer, are
under-strappers
,
with him, in the trade.
Ths being
signified
to the Captain who
was now called in, he
addressed
the
justice
to the following effect: Mr.
Justice
,
said
he, what I have related to you upon
oath, however improbable it may appear,
is the fact; and as to your
surmises
of
horse
stealing
, they are
groundless
; and you
may commit, if you think proper; but you
shall
answer
for the
consequences
. It is
no
small
matter to deprive a citizen of his
li-
liberty, and I am not
so
much unknown
to the government, as not to obtain
redress
against
an ignoramus like you, who
disgrace
the
commission
by your
stupidity
,
as many of the
same
office do. The
utmost
of your power is to commit; but it
may come in my turn to impeach, for
your
abuse
of power. What proof, or
presumption
have you, that I have
stolen
horses
? Is it that of having a
servant
on
foot, rather than having one mounted? If
I had
stolen
one
horse
, could I not as well
have
stolen
two? The
presumption
is the
reverse
of what your
worship
states
. As
to the North Briton, who is charged with
bastardy
, by the name of Niel Ryburn,
with a certain Kate Maybone, where is
the woman? cannot
she
be brought face to
face with the man, and confronted? Let
her then
say
if this is Niel Ryburn; and
that this
simple
lad is the
person
who
begot
a child with her,
six
or eight months
ago. I am
persuaded
he was on the
east
of the Atlantic at that time, and if
she
could
become pregnant by him,
she
must
have
been on that
side
also
. Let this matter be
examined.
From the
sedate
and firm manner with
which the Captain had
expressed
himself
,
the
the
justice
began to be
apprehensive
of
having been
mistaken
, and was
intimidated
.
He was willing therefore to
send
for
the woman who had made the oath.
Being
in the village,
she
was in a
short
time
brought before his
worship
, by the
constable
who had been
dispatched
for that
purpose
.
Kate,
said
the
magistrate
, is not this
the Scotch pedler, the father of your child,
and
against
whom you have made oath?
The father of my child!
said
Kate; does
your
worship
think, I would let
such
a
servant
looking
son
of a bitch as that, get
me with child? does your
worship
mean
to affront me, by having him taken up in
the place of the moving merchant, Mr.
Ryburn? no, no; he is not the father of
my child. I never
saw
the
clumsy
looking
dunce in my life before.
Duncan was well
pleased
to be relieved
from the charge of
bastardy
; but at the
same
time a little hurt, at the undervaluing
of the
witness
. Young lady,
said
he, I
wish
you muckle joy o' your big belly, but I
dinna envy the pedlar o' his guid luck o'
ha'eing you wi' bairn. If I was to
stand
i' the
stool
, it
should
be for anither
sort
of
luking
lassie
; and no
sik
a brazen fac'd
ane as ye are.
Kate
Kate was about to make reply; but the
justice
not thinking it comported with the
dignity of office, to
suffer
an altercation in
his
presence
, and being chagrined at not
finding this to be the real culprit,
released
the
arrest
, with ill humour,
desiring
Captain
,
prisoner
, Kate, and
constable
, to
be gone about their
business
.
CHAP.
CHAP. X.
THE
second
day after this, in the
afternoon
of the day, as the Captain
and his man Duncan were advancing on
their journey, they perceived a
person
a
head, coming towards them, with a long
slouching
walk, as if in
considerable
haste
,
and a
stick
in his hand. If that man had
not his face the wrong way,
said
the
Captain
,
I
should
take him for the revenue
officer
,
Teague O'Regan; he has a good
deal of his appearance, both in his
person
and his gait. But he cannot have
mistaken
his direction
so
much as to be coming
this way,
instead
of going to his
district
.
I dinna ken,
said
Duncan;
these
Irish
ay put the wrang end o' their
speech
foremost
;
and why not put the wrang end o'
their
course
now and then.
As they were debating, the
person
approached
,
and it was
discovered
to be
Teague
.
He
He had advanced to a
pass
of the
mountain
,
where he was met and
opposed
by
two men, of an athletic
personal
appearance
,
who forbade him, at his peril, to
proceed farther. They were armed with
clubs, and
presented
a very choleric
countenance. The revenue officer had
thought it not
advisable
to encounter them,
being two to one, and
proposed
rather to
fall back, and join
himself
to the Captain
and the Scotchman, who might
support
him in his march.
These
two men were of the name of
Valentine
and
Orson
;
so
called either from
the
fierceness
of their nature, or from
their
superior
strength
,
resembling
the two
champions of that name, of whom we read
in books of romance. They had been
born and bred in
these
mountains.
Valentine had the advantage of
some
education
with a
Welsh
school
-
master
, who
passed
his native language upon the young
man for Latin;
so
that conceiving
himself
to have acquired the rudiments of this
tongue
,
and therefore qualified to enter on
the
study
of
some
one of the learned
professions
,
he had deliberated whether he
should
plead law, preach, or be a
physician
;
but happening one day to
see
a
member
ber
Vol. IV. H
of
Congress
riding along, with a boy
behind him, carrying a portmanteau, he
had taken it into his head to be a member
himself
, and had
canvassed
frequently for
that delegation; but had been
disappointed
;
one
person
and another coming
forward
,
and taking off the votes. He had
made up his mind for
some
time
past
to
make an experiment of
personal
force, to
intimidate competitors. For this
purpose
,
he had taken to his
assistance
another
young man of the name of
Orson
, whom
he found in the neighbourhood, and with
whom
sallying
out as a kind of
squire
, or
armour-bearer, he could knock down any
fellow that had the impudence to
set
up
against
him in the
district
.
Orson
had not
actually been
suckled
by a bear, like his
name
sake
in romance; but he was a rough,
stout
man, and well qualified to bear a part
in this mode of
canvassing
.
The rumour had prevailed by
some
means, that Teague was coming forward
to
stand
a trial in that
district
; whether
propagated by
some
wag, who
passed
him
on the road, and was
disposed
to
amuse
himself
with the
apprehensions
of the two
rustics
; or to
some
mistake
on the parr of
tra-
travellers, who had come through the
village
in the neighbourhood.
The Captain, however, and the revenue
officer
himself
, had
resolved
their menace
into a
dislike
of the
excise
law, and a
wish
to intimidate, or prevent by force, the
opening
an
inspection
office in that
district
.
Under
these
impressions
, advancing to
the
pass
, they were met by the young
men, who made a
shew
of battle; though
on their part, not a little
disconcerted
at
seeing
Teague return with a reinforcement,
and with the advantage of cavalry.
The Captain placed
himself
in the
center
,
on
horse
-back, and a little in
advance
of the two wings on foot,
Duncan
and Teague. The North Briton,
preserved
a
composed
manner, and
shewed
a
steady
countenance. The Hibernian, on
the other hand, willing by an appearance
of great rage, and much valour, to
supercede
the
necessity
of battle, or blood-
shed
,
stood
with his right foot before the left,
flourishing
his cudgel, and grinning like
an angry
person
, who was impatient for
the
onset
.
As is the manner of heroic men, the
Captain thought proper, before the
commencement
of
hostilities
, to
accost
the
advere
verse
combatants, to
see
whether it might
not be in his power to remove, or at
least
allay their prejudices
against
the obnoxious
law, and induce them to
suffer
the officer
to
pass
. Accordingly he
addressed
them
in the following words:
Gentlemen,
said
he, the law may be
exceptionable on general principles, or
locally unequal in its operation to you in
this
district
.
Nevertheless
, it is the law,
and has received the
sanction
of the
public
voice, made known through the
constitutional
organ, the
representatives
of the
people. It is the great principle of a
republican
government, that the will of the
majority
shall
govern. The general will
has made this a law, and it behoves
individual
minds to
submit
.
I wad na fleech and prig wi' them,
said
Duncan,
stepping
forward, and
flourishing
his cudgel. I wad na hae many words
about
it. But
just
see
at ance whether they
will dare to
stap
the high road. Gin they
persist
, I can tak ane o' them, and ye and
Teague, can tak the ither, and my lug for
it, I
sal
gie the ane that fa's to my lot, a
weel payed
skin
, I warrant him. Sae
dinna
ye tak up time fairlying about the
matter
;
but gae on, and try our rungs o'er
the
the hurdies o' them. I
sal
gar this
stick
crack o'er the riggin o' the loons, in a
wie while.
Teague, in the mean time, was on the
back ground, endeavouring to look
sour
,
making wry mouths, and grinning
occasionally
:
all this with a view to
support
the threats of the North Briton.
Duncan,
said
the Captain, for he had
not attended to Teague, put up your
cudgel. Policy oftentimes avails more
than force. The law in
question
may
beodious
,
and great allowance ought to be
made for the prejudices of the people. By
sost
measures
, and mild words,
prejudices
may be overcome.
These
appear to
be but young men; and
rashness
is a
concomitant
of early life. By
expostulation
we may probably have the good
fortune
to be able to
pass
on, without being
under the
necessity
to attempt battery, or
shed
blood.
The two young men were not to be
intimidated
by a
shew
of cudgels, or
grinning
,
and wry mouths; but
still
conceiving
that the object of the Captain was to
force an election in favour of his
precusor
,
the Hibernian, and not
understanding
the
scope
of his harrangue, but
upposing
sing
H 2
him to
speak
of the law of election
where the votes of the majority, that is,
the greater number of votes,
constitutes
the
representative
, they were as much
disposed
to
use
force as at
first
; and,
advancing
,
appeared ready to
sustain
the
shock
.
An affray
must
have
ensued
; for the
Captain having taken every
possible
measure
to avoid blows, was now
resolute
to
force the
pass
, even at the
risk
of battle.
But
just
at this
instant
, a grave man
coming
from the village, who had known the
character, and had been frequently a
witness
of the conduct of the young men,
addressed
them: Young men,
said
he,
will you be eternally running into errors
of this kind. Have you interrogated
these
gentlemen, and
understood
from
themselves
whether any of them are candidates,
and mean to
disturb
you by
setting
up for
Congress
in this
district
? It is
possibly
the
humour of
some
wag coming up the road,
and knowing your
disposition
, that has
created the
surmise
.
The fact was, that
some
wag who had
passed
Teague on the road, and who had
known the
apprehensions
of Valentine, had
given
rise
to the report. For he thought to
amuse
himself
by it, knowing the
extravagancies
gancies
into which it would of
course
throw
the two young men. For the whole
country
,
not long before that time, had heard
in what manner they had
mistaken
individuals
for public candidates. On one
occasion
they had fought with a
mason
and
his barrow-man, and
abused
them
considerably
.
On another
occasion
, they had
knocked down a potter with a bag of
earthen-ware, and broke
several
of his
vessels
. For this
reason
, the grave man, of
whom I
spoke
, who had got a hint by
some
means of what they were about,
had traced the young men, and coming
up at the critical moment,
addressed
them
as I have before
said
, exhorting them to
make enquiry
first
, whether their
apprehensions
were well or ill founded; and not
to take it for granted that either of
these
personages
, were competitors for
Congress
,
before the fact had been
ascertained
,
and their
pretensions
considered
by an
amicable
expostulation
.
Candidates for
Congress
!
said
the
Captain
;
what could have put that into the
young mens heads? is it true, this
bog-trotter
,
who is now an
excise
officer, was
on the point once of being a candidate,
or at
least
of being elected, a
repreentative
tive
of the union; but having
escaped
that, though with
some
difficulty, he is
now in the executive department; and
has received an appointment to the
collection
of the revenue of a
district
beyond
this, to which he is now on his way; and
is far from having any thoughts of an
election
of any kind whatever.
The two young men, at this, were
relieved
from their fears, and their minds
seemed
dilated with
unusual
joy. Stepping
forward, they
shook
hands with Teague,
and invited him to drink with them; but
the Captain apologized, alledging the
necessity
on the part of O'Regan, to
press
forward as
speedily
as
possible
, and to be
on the
spot
where the functions of his duty
called him. This apology
seeming
to
suffice
,
they all three made
obeisance
to
the young men, and to the grave looking
man; and
passed
on.
CHAP
CHAP. XI.
Containing Reflections.
It
may be thought
preposterous
in
these
young men to attempt force in the
matter of an election. That depends on
their
possessing
any other faculty by which
they could
succeed
. Have not all animals
recourse
to
these
means of providing for
themselves
, which nature has given them?
The
squirrel
climbs a tree, while the wolf
runs through the brake. The cat lies in
wait, and watches for her prey; while the
greyhound
pursues
with open mouth, and
seizes
the hare or the fox.
Valentine would not
seem
to have
possessed
the advantage of mental
recommendations
;
he could not have it in his power
to allure and
persuade
. Why not
therefore
act by
compulsion
, and
use
force?
But why not make application of this force
upon the voters
themselves
, and knock
down either before or after an election,
all
all
those
who had been
obstinate
, in
withholding
their
suffrages
? It is probable that
experiment had been made of this, and
that it had been found ineffectual. What
then remained, but to repel the
intrusion
of competitors. It was more convenient,
as there were fewer of
these
; at
least
it
rarely happens, that there are as many
candidates
as voters. It
seems
more natural,
as beginning at the
source
, and
repressing
the
pretensions
of the
canvassing
individuals
,
who are
usually
the
first
movers
in the
business
. It is of the nature of a
summary
proceeding, and avoids delay,
to break the head of a competitor, and
induce him by fear, if not by
modesty
, to
desist
.
It may be queried, what
respectability
in the capacity of
legislators
can
such
persons
have, after having been elected,
without
the
requisite
information on
state
affairs
,
or talent of eloquence, to make a
figure
in a public body? That is no
business
of mine. It belongs to
these
that
set
up for
such
appointment, to
consider
this. It may
be
said
, however, that it is not
necessary
that
all
should
make a figure in the
same
way.
In the exhibition of a circus, you will be
as much diverted with the clown who
mounts
mounts a
horse
clumsily
, or who attempting
to tumble, falls on his
backside
, as with
the
greatest
activity
shewn
by the
master
.
In
music
,
bass
is
useful
; nay, may be
thought to be
necessary
, to mix with the
treble. An illetirate and ignorant member
of a deliberative
assembly
, forms an
agreeable
contrast
with the intelligent;
just
as in
gardening, we are
pleased
with a wild
copse
after a parterre.
It may be thought a
vesania
,
or
species
of
madness
, to entertain
such
an
inordinate
passion
for the
legislature
. Not at
all; it was not a
madness
properly
so
called, by which I mean, a
physical
derangement
of the intellect. The
cause
was merely moral; and the derangement
only
such
as
exists
in all
cases
, where the
mind is not well regulated by education,
and where the
passions
are
strong
and
intemperate
.
This young man Valentine had
conceived, at an early period, the idea of
becoming a
legislator
; and as has been
said
, from
seeing
some
member of
Congress
pass
the road, with a
servant
and
portmanteau
also
; not at all
comprehending
the
necessity
, or at
least
usefulness
, of
a knowledge of the geography of the world
in commercial
questions
; or of
history
in
pol-
political: he had been
accustomed
at home
to run a foot race with a wood-ranger; to
lift a piece of timber at a
house
building,
or log-rolling; or to
wrestle
at
Cornish
-hug
with the young men of the village; and had
imagined that the
same
degree of
strength
and dexterity, which had given him a
superiority
,
or at
least
made him
respectable
in
these
, would
raise
him to reputation in
the efforts of the human mind.
Why need we wonder at an uneducated
young man judging
so
preposterously
on
great
subjects
. It is not to be
presumed
that
he ever had an opportunity of reading
Cudworth's
Intellectual
System
, or any other
writer on
the eternal
fitness
of things
. This
belongs to the
schools
; I mean the higher
academies, where
metaphysics
, and the
co-relate
science
of logic, is taught.
I am aware that malevolent
persons
,
judging
from their feelings, will alledge that
in the caricature I have given of the
mountain
candidate, I have had
some
prototype
in view, and hence intended a
satire
upon
individuals It will not be a fair
deduction
;
unless
it is
restrained
simply
to
this, that
something
like it has occurred in
the
course
of my
observation
, which has
given
rise
to my idea of the picture.
Now
Now that I am upon the
subject
of
elections
for deliberative
assemblies
, I will
make a few general
observations
, without
meaning to give offence to any one.
There are but two characters that can
be
respectable
as
representatives
of the
people. A plain man of good
sense
,
whether
farmer, mechanic, or merchant; or
a man of education and literary talents.
The intermediate characters, who have
neither
just
natural reflection, nor the
advantage
of reading, are unnatural, and can
derive no
happiness
to
themselves
from the
appointment; nor can they be of
use
to
the commonwealth.
But men err, not only judging
falsely
of
their capacity for a public
trust
, but in the
means of obtaining it. I have in view,
not only all indelicacy in the
solicitation
of
votes, but in the management that is too
often
used
on election days, in changing
tickets,
obstructing
windows, voting more
than once; a thing tolerable perhaps, or
at
least
excusable
, in the election of a
sheriff
, an office of profit; but which ought
to be
considered
indelicate in a
competition
for honour. It is
impossible
for any law
to reach the cure of this evil; it can be
remedied
only by attaching
disgrace
in public
opinion,
Vol. IV. I
opinion, to them or the like arts. I do not
mean to
represent
as indelicate the
candidates
offering to
serve
. For I would
rather
be
accused
of forwardness to offer
myself
,
that of affectation to decline, when I was
willing to be elected. The one favours of
cowardice and
falsehood
; the other, at the
worst
, can be called but vanity.
The wife and virtuous
exercise
of the
right of
suffrage
, is the
first
spring
of
happiness
in a republic. If this is touched
corruptly, or
unskilfully
, the movements of
the machine are throughout affected. Not
only judicious regulations by
positive
law
are
necessary
to
secure
this, but the
system
of family and
scholastick
education ought
to contemplate it. An advice which no
father
ought to fail to give to his
son
should
be to this effect. Young man, you have
the good fortune to be born in a republic;
a felicity that has been enjoyed but by a
small
portion of the race of man, in any
age of the world. In
some
ages it has been
enjoyed by none at all. It is a principle
of this government, that every man, has
a right
to elect,
and a right
to be elected
.
In the
exercise
of the
first
, the right to
elect, be taught my
son
, to
preserve
a
scrupulous
and delicate honour: And as
at
at
school
, the
sense
of
shame
amongst
your
equals, would
restrain
you from all fraud,
in obtaining a game at fives;
so
much more
now that your are a man, let it
restrain
you
from all
unfairness
in this the great game
of man. With regard to being elected,
your
first
consideration
will be your talent.
Quid valeant humeri, quid ferre
recusent
.
At
school
, you would
despise
the boy
who would
set
himself
forward, as an
expert
swimmer
or
wrestler
, who was
deficient
in
skill
at
these
exercises
. In order
to be
respectable
, put not
yourself
above
your
strength
. If you covet the honour
of a public
trust
, think of qualifying
yourself
for it; and let the people think of
chusing
you to
discharge
it; that is their
business
.
Lay in a
stock
of knowledge by
reading in early life. Your old age, by
these
means will acquire dignity; and
appointments
will readily follow. You will
be under no
necessity
of
solliciting
inordinately
the
suffrage
of men.
CHAP
CHAP. XII.
THE Captain and the two on foot,
journeyed from bence together,
without any material incident falling out,
or any thing to attract the attention;
save
what
arose
from the
sparring
of the
aroe">arose
from the
sparring
of the
bog-troppers
.
This took place on the ground
of irreligion in Teague, and
disregard
for
the covenants; but more
especially
on a
difference of opinion with regard to the
desert
of their
respective
services
, in the
late rencounter with the highway-men,
as they were
disposed
to call them; Teague
alledging that he had intimidated them
by grinning, and wry mouths; Duncan
claiming the credit by the
display
of his
cudgel. The Captain had a good deal of
trouble, in parrying a
decision
of their
respective
pretensions
; or
adjusting
them in
such
a manner as to
satisfy
both. They
were likely
sometimes
to come to blows.
He was relieved, however, by the approach
of
of the revenue officer to his
district
, into
which they now began to enter.
After
some
days peregrination through
it, having made choice of a central
situation
,
it was thought proper to open an
inspection
office, which was done by hiring
a
house
, and writing over the door,
Inspection
office of Survey,
No. &c.
Suspicion
had
existed
on the part of
the government, that
opposition
would be
made in this
district
to the opening an
office; or at
least
to the collection of the
revenue.
These
were founded not only in
reports of threats of that nature; but in
some
instances
of actual violence,
clandestinely
committed on deputies. It was
for this
reason
,
amongst
others, that
the
President
had made choice of
O'Regan
,
a
stout
and
resolute
man, as he
thought him, with a
shelalah
in his hand,
who could repel
occasional
insults
. So far
these
suspicions
appeared to be without
foundation; the officer having
conspicuously
traversed
the
district
, and opened an
office without
molestation
.
The Captain was now about to return
home, having
seen
the
establishment
of his
ward in an office under government. But
before he parted with him, he thought it
not
I 2
not
amiss
to give him
lessons
with regard
to the
discharge
of his duty in his
present
appointment. With this view, drawing
him into a walk the
second
day, a
small
distance
from the village, he began his
lecture
in the following words:
Teague,
said
he, for I am
still
in the
habit of giving you that appellation, not
having yet
ascertained
whether you are to
be
stiled
, your
worship
, your honour, or
your reverence; or at
least
not having yet
been
accustomed
to add
these
epithets;
Teague, I
say
, you are now advanced
to great dignity; a limb of the executive
of the union. It is true, your department
is
ministerial
.
Nevertheless
it requires
the
wisdom
of the head to conduct it. But
the integrity of the heart is the great
object to be regarded. Keep your
hands from bribes; and by a delicate
impartiality
towards all, even from the
suspicion
of taking them. I
should
regret
indeed after all the pains I have taken in
sitting
you for an office, and contributing
to your appointment, to hear of an
impeachment
against
you, for a
misdemeanor
in that office. By conducting
yourself
with a
scrupulous
honour and pure
morality in your
present
trust
, the way is
open
open to a higher grade of advancement;
and there is no kind of doubt, but that in
due time it will be attainable. The
President
of the United States, from whom
you have received your
commission
, is
said
to have the virtue, or rather the
excess
of
one, never to abandon the
person
whom
he has once taken up; or at
least
to carry
his attachment to an extreme of reluctance
in that particular; whether owing to great
slowness
in conceiving unfavourably of
any one; or to pride of mind, in an
unwillingness
to have it thought that his
judgment could be fallible. You will
have an advantage here; but at the
same
time there is an ultimate point in this, as
in all things, beyond which it is
impossible
to
preserve
a man. Bear this in mind,
and be
honest
, attentive, and faithful in
your duty, and let it be
said
of you, that
you have
shewn
yourself
a good citizen.
Just
at this
instant
a
noise
was heard,
and, looking up, a crowd of people were
discovered
at a
considerable
distance
,
advancing
towards them, but with
acclamations
that began to be heard. They were
dragging a piece of timber of
considerable
length, which appeared to be
just
hewn
from the woods; and was the natural
stem
of
of a
small
tree, cut down from the
stump
,
and the bark
stripped
off. At the
same
time a couple of pack-
horses
were driven
along, which appeared to be loaded with
beds, and pillow
cases
.
The Captain was led to believe that
these
were a number of the country
people
,
who having heard of the revenue
officer
coming to his
district
, had come
forward
to pay their
respects
to him, and
to receive him with that gratulation which
is common to
honest
but illiterate people,
in the
first
paroxysms
of their
transport
.
Having
understood
that country to be
chiefly peopled with the
descendants
of the
Irish
, or with
Irish
emigrants
themselves
,
he had
supposed
that hearing the new
officer
was a countryman, they had been
carried
forward, with
such
zeal to receive
him, with huzzaing and tumult. On this
occasion
, he thought it not
amiss
to turn
the
conversation
; and to prepare the mind
and the manners of the deputy for this
scene
, which being
unusual
, might
disconcert
and
embarrass
him.
Teague,
said
he, it is not
less
difficult
to
preserve
equanimity in a
prosperous
situation
,
than to
sustain
with fortitude a
depression
of fortune.
These
people, I
perceive
,
ceive,
ceive, in a flow of mind are coming
forward
,
to
express
, with warmth, the
honest
,
but irregular
sallies
of their joy, on
your arrival
amongst
them. It was
usual
in the provinces under the Roman
republic
,
when a
Questor
, of whom a
favourable
impression
had preceded, was about to
come
amongst
them. It is a
pleasing
, but
a
transient
felicity, and a
wise
man will
not count too much upon it. For popular
favour is
unstable
to a proverb.
These
very people in the
course
of a
twelve-month
,
if you
displease
them, may
shout
as loud at your degradation, and removal
from dignity. At the
same
time, this
ought not to lead you to be indifferent, or
at
least
to
seem
so
, to their well-meant
expressions
of favour at
present
; much
less
to
affect a contempt, or even a neglect of
them. A medium of
ease
and
gracefulness
in receiving their advance, and
answering
their
address
, whether it be a
rustic
orator
in an extempore harrangue, or
some
scholar
of the academy, or
school
-
master
,
they may have have prevailed upon to draw
up a
speech
, and read it to you. There is
no manner of doubt, but the
President
of
the United States, may have been a
thousand
times
embarrassed
with the multitude
of
of
addresses
delivered, or
presented
, to
him; and it required no
small
patience
and fortitude to
sustain
them. Yet it has
been remarked, that he has received them
all with complacency;
shewing
himself
neither elevated with the
praise
, nor
irritated
with the
intrusion
. And it is but
reasonable
, and what a benevolent man
would indulge; for it is a
happiness
to
these
creatures, to give
themselves
the
opportunity
of being
distinguished
in this
manner.
Duncan who had heard a rumour in the
village of what was going forward, had in
the mean time come up, and
understanding
from the
last
words of the Captain
what had been the drift of his
conversation
with Teague, and
discovering
his
mistake
,
interrupted him at this place. Captain,
said
he, ye need na be
cowshuning
him
against
applause
, and popularity, and the
turning o' the head, wi'
praise
, and guid
usage
: for I doubt muckle if it comes to
that wi' him yet. I wad rather
suspect
that
these
folks have na guid will towards him.
I dinna ken what they mean to do wi'
him, but if a body might
guess
frae the
bed ye
see
there on the poney's back, they
mean to
toss
him in a blanker. But if it
were
were to be judged frae the tree they hae
trailing after them, I wad
suppose
they
mean to make a hanging matter o' it, and
take his life a' the gether. There is na
doubt but they are coming in a mob, to
make a
seizure
o' the gauger, and the
talk o' the town is o' a
punishment
I dinna
understand
, o' tarring and feathering. I
have heard o' the
stocks
, and the gallows,
and drowning like a witch, but I never
heard o' the like o' that in Scotland. I have
heard o' tarring the
sheep
, to keep them
frae the rot, but I never heard o' tarring
a human creature. May be they mean to
put it on his
nose
, to hinder him frae
smelling
their
whiskey
. I
see
they got a keg o't
there in their rear, drawn upon a
sled
; at
least
, I
suppose
it to be
whisky
they hae in
that keg, to take a dram, as they gae on
wi the frolic;
unless
it be the tar that they
talk of to put upon the officer.
This
last
conjecture was the true one.
For it was tar; and the
stem
of a tree
which they drew, was what is called a
liberty
pole, which they were about to erect,
in order to dance round it, with hallooing,
and the whoop of exultation.
The calvacade now approaching, they
began
began to
cast
their eyes towards the groupe
of the three as they
stood
together.
By de holy faders,
said
Teague, I
see
de have deir looks upon me. De look as
wild as de White Boys, or de Hearts of
Oak in Ireland. By de holy
apostles
, dere
is no fighting wid pitch forks; we
shall
be
kilt, and murdered into de bargain.
Teague,
said
the Captain, recollect that
you are an officer of government, and it
becomes you to
support
its dignity, not
betraying unmanly fear, but
sustaining
the violence even of a mob
itself
with
fortitude
.
Fait, and I had rader be no officer at
all,
said
Teague, if dis is de way de
paple
get out o' dair
senses
in dis country.
Take de office
yourshelf
; the devil burn
me, but I
shall
be after laying it down, as
fast
as I ever took it up, if dis is to come
of it; to be hooted at like a wild
baste
,
and
shot
, and hanged upon a tree, like a
squirrel
, or a Pady from Cork, when de
foolish
boys hang him upon the 17th of
March, with potatoes about his neck, to
make
sun
o' de
Irish
. I
scorn
to be
choaked
before I am dead; de devil burn de
office for me, I'l have none of it. I can take
my Bible oath, and
swear
upon de holy
cross
cross
, dat I am no officer. By
shaint
Patrick
,
and ifdere are any
Irish
boys,
amongst
dem I would rather join wid dem. What is
de government with offices to a
son
o'd a
whore dat is choaked, and cannot
spake
to
his acquaintance in dis world. By de holy,
apostles
, I am no officer; I
just
took it for,
a frolic as I was coming up de road, and;
you may be officer
yourself
, and good
luck wid de
commission
, Captain; I
shall
have noting to do wid it.
At this
instant
the advancing croud;
raised
a loud
shout
, crying,
Liberty and
no
excise
, liberty and no
excise
; down with
all
excise
officers
.
Teague began to tremble, and to
sculk
behind the Captain. By de holy vater o'
de
confession
,
said
he, dey are like de
favages
,
dey have deir eyes upon me, I
shall
be
scalped
; I
shall
be kilt and have de hair
off my head, like a wolf or a
shape
. God
love you, Captain,
spake
a good word to
dem, and tell dem a good
story
; or by de
Christian
church, I
shall
be eat up like a
toad, or a wild
baste
in de
forests
.
The bog-trotter was right; for this
moment
,
they had got their eyes upon the
groupe; and began to
distinguish
him as
the officer of the revenue. An exact
description
scrip
-
Vol. IV. K
had been given them, of his
person
and appearance; for
these
people
had their
correspondents
, even at the feat
of government; and travellers, moreover,
had
recognised
him, and given an account
of his
physiognomy
, and apparel.
There he is, there he is, was the
language
;
the
rescally
excise
officer; we
shall
soon
take care of him. He is of the
name of O'Regan, is he? We
shall
O'Regan
him in a
short
time.
The devil burn me, if I am de
excise
officer,
said
Teague. It is all a
mistake
gentlemen. It is true I was offered the
commission
; but the Captain here knows
dat I would not take it. It is dis
Scotchman
that is the officer. By my
shoul
, you
may tar and feather him, and welcome.
No,
said
the Captain
stepping
forward,
no, gentlemen: for
so
I yet call you;
though the menaces which you
express
,
and the appearance of force which your
preparations exhibit, depart from the
desert
of that appelation.
Nevertheless
, as
there is
still
a probability of
arresting
violence
,
and reclaiming you from the error
of your meditated acts, I
address
you with
the epithet of gentlemen. You are not
mistaken
in your
designation
of the officer
of
of the revenue, though he has not the
cundour, to avow
himself
; but would
meanly
subject
a fellow bog-trotter to the
odium and the
risk
; an act of which,
after
all the pains that have been taken of
his education, to
impress
him with
sentiments
of truth and honour, I am greatly
ashamed
. No, Gentlemen, I am unwilling
to deceive you, or that the meditated
injury
should
fall on him, who if he has
not the honour of the office, ought not to
bear the
occasional
disadvantage
: I am
ready to acknowledge and avow, nor
shall
these
wry faces, and
contorsions
of body,
which you
observe
in the red-headed man,
prevent me; that he is the
bona fide,
actual
excise
officer.
Nevertheless
, gentlemen,
let me
expostulate
with you on his behalf.
Let me endeavour to
save
him from your
odium, not by
falsehood
, but by
reason
.
Is it not a principle of that republican
government
which you have
established
, that
the will of the majority
shall
govern; and
has not the will of the majority of the
United
States enacted this law? will
By this time, they had
sunk
the but end
of the
sapling
in the hole dug for it, and
it
stood
erect with a flag
displayed
in the
air, and was called a Liberty Pole. The
beds
beds, and pillow
cases
had been cut open,
and were brought forward. A committee
had been appointed to conduct the
operation
.
It was while they were occupied in
doing this, that the Captain had without
interruption gone on in making his
harangue
.
But
these
things being now
adjusted
,
a principal
person
of the committee
came forward,
just
at the
last
words of the
Captain.
The will of the majority,
said
he; yes,
faith; the will of the majority
shall
govern
.
It is right that it
should
be the
case
. We know the
excise
officer very
well. Come lay hands upon him.
Guid folk,
said
Duncan, I am no the
gauger, it is true; nor am I a friend to
the
excise
law, though I came in
company
wi' the officer;
nevertheless
I dinna
approve o' this, o' your dinging down the
government. For what is it but dinging
down the government to act
against
the
laws. Did ye never read i' the Bible, that
rebellion is
warse
than witchcraft? Did ye
never read o' how many lairds, and dukes,
were hanged in Scotland lang ago, for
rebellion? when the government comes to
take this up, ye
sal
all be made out rebels,
and hanged. Ye had better think what
ye
ye are about. Ye dinna gie fair play. If ye
want to fight, and ony o' ye will turn out
wi' me, I
shall
take a turn wi' him; and
no
just
jump upon a man a' in ae lump,
like a parcel o' tinklers at a fair.
The committee had paid no attention to
this harangue; but had in the mean time
seized
Teague, and conveyed him to a
cart, in which the keg of tar had been
placed. The operation had commenced
amidst
the vociferation of the
bog-trotter
,
crossing
himself
, and preparing for
purgatory. They had
stripped
him of his
vestments
, and pouring the tar upon his
naked body, emptied at the
same
time a
bed of feathers on his head, which adhering
to the
viscous
fluid, gave him the appearance
of a wild fowl of the
forest
. The cart
being
driven off with the
prisoner
in this
state
, a great part of the mob
accompanied
,
with the
usual
exclamation of
Liberty
,
and no
excise
law. Down with all
excise
officers.

CHAP. XIII.
Containing Reflections.
It is time now to make
some
reflections,
were it not only for the
sake
of form;
just
as the clergyman who divides his text
into
several
heads, and then adds, we
shall
conclude with an improvement of the
whole; or with a few practical
observations
,
or reflections. In early life, when
long
sermons
tired me, the young mind
not capable of a long attention, I
used
to look out for this peroratory part of
the
discourse
, with much anxiety; not
that I valued it more than any other, for
the
intrinsic
worth of it; but merely
because
it was the
last
. It appeared to me
an
unconscionable
thing in a man to
speak
too long, when it was left to
himself
how long he
should
speak
. Ah! if it
was known how many
curses
I have given
tedious
speakers
even in the pulpit
itself
,
in my time, I
should
be thought a very
wick-
wicked man. Perhaps
some
may think
that I am a tedious writer. Well; but
have not readers it in their power to lay
down the book when they think proper,
and begin again?
But as I was
saying
, it has become time
to make
some
reflections, of which it
must
be acknowledged, I have been
sparing
in this the latter part of my
performance
.
But upon what
shall
I reflect? The
vanity of things,
doubtless
. But in what
mode
shall
I
present
this vanity? In
moralizing
on the
disappointment
of the
Captain
and the revenue officer, with the
waiting
man Duncan
Ferguson
, coming
forward
to
establish
offices, and all at once
made
prisoners
, and treated as the
meanest
culprits? or
shall
it be on the
mistaken
patriotism
of even good, though uninformed
men,
opposing
an obnoxious, and unequal
law, not by
remonstrance
, but by actual
force, and thereby
sapping
all principle,
or rather overthrowing all
structure
of a
republican government. No:
these
are
exhausted
topics. I
shall
rather content
myself
at
present
, with a differtation, on
that mode of
disgrace
, or
punishment
,
which was
chosen
in the
case
of the
revenue
officer; tarring and feathering.
I
I find no trace of this mode of
punishment
amongst
the ancients, I mean the
Greeks, Hebrews, and Romans. Having
had
occasion
lately to look over the
whole book of Deuteronomy, I have paid
attention to this particular, and have
discovered
no
vestige
of it.
Amongst
the
Greeks,
so
far as my memory
serves
me,
there is nothing like it. I recollect well
the
sanctions
of criminal law
amongst
the
Romans. And what appears to me to come
nearst
to this of tarring and feathering, is
the
punishment
of the
sewing
up the
culprit
in a
sack
, with an ape, a
serpent
, and
a fox; and throwing him into a river, or
a balon of the
sea
, to drown, if he had
escaped
death by his companions in the
mean time.
As to the origin of tarring and
feathering
,
I am at a
loss
to
say
. It would
seem
to me, that it took its
rise
in the town
of Bofton,
just
before the
commencement
of the American revolution.
Unless
,
indeed, it
should
be contended that
Nebuchadnezzar was tarred and feathered;
of which I am not
persuaded
;
because
tho'
it is
said
that his nails had grown to
eagles
claws, and in that
case
presenting
the talons of a bird, which a tarred and
fea-
feathered man
resembles
, yet at the
sam
time it is added, he eat
grass
like an ox.
Now a turkey buzzard, or a bald eagle,
does not eat
grass
like an ox; nor do I
know that
these
sowls
eat
grass
at all, at
least
so
obviously
as to make the eating
grass
a
distinguishing
characteristic
of their nature.
I
shall
therefore give up the
hypothesis
of
Nebuchadnezzar being tarred and
feathered
.
It would appear to me to be what may
be called a revolutionary
punishment
,
beyound
what in a
settled
state
of the
government
may be inflicted by the opprobrium of
opinion; and yet
short
of the coercion of
the laws. It was in this middle
stare
, that
it took it's
rise
with us;
answering
the
same
end, but with a more mild
operation
,
than that of the lantern, at the
commencement
of the revolution in France.
It took
rise
in the
sea
coast
towns in
America
;
and I would
suppose
it to be owing
to
some
accidental conjunction of the
seamen
and the citizens,
devising
a mode of
punishment
for a
person
obnoxious. The
sailors
naturally thought of tar, and the
women, who
used
to be
assisting
on
these
occasions
, thought of
bolsters
and
pillowcases
.
Let
Let it
suffice
that I have
suggested
the
question
, and leave it to be
settled
by
some
other
person
, at
some
future period.
CHAP. XIV.
WITH regard to Teague whom we
left in the hands of the unob,
having
been carted about the village, until
the eyes of all were
satiated
with the
spectacle
,
he was
dismissed
, but ordered to
depart
from what was called the
survey
,
under
the penalty of being
seized
again, and
hanged on the liberty pole, to which they
pointed at the
same
time, and on which
there was a
cross
bar, which appeared to
render it convenient for that
purpose
.
The unfortunate officer was not
slow
to
take the hint, but as
soon
as he was out
of their hands, made his way to the
wilderness
.
There we
shall
leave him for the
present
, and return to the Captain, whom
we left in the village, and who had been
employed during the
occasion
,
reasoning
with
with the people, and endeavouring
first
to divert them from the outrage, and
afterwards
to convince them of the
error
of it, and the danger of the
consequences
.
Instead
of allaying their
fervour
,
and convincing their judgments, it
had begun to provoke, and irritate
exceedingly
;
and gave birth to
surmises
that
he was an accomplice of the
excise
officer,
which in a
short
time grew into a rumour,
that he meant to continue the
inspection
office
,
and
substitute
the North Briton as a
deputy in the room of O'Regan, until his
return. Under this
impression
,
assembling
next day, they proceeded to pull down
the
inspection
office altogether, and to
enquire
for the Captain and his valet, that
they might tar and feather them
also
.
The Captain having had a hint of this,
and judging from the experiment he had
made, that it was in vain to
oppose
the
violence
of the people, outrather to yield to it
for the
present
, thought proper to withdraw
from the village for a time, and take his
rout to wards the mountains, where he might
remain at
some
farm
house
, until a more
peaceable
state
of things
should
take place.
He had travelled the greater part of the
day, and towards evening when he began
to
to think of taking quarters for the night,
he came to a narrow valley at the foot of
the mountain, with a
small
, but a clear
and rapid
stream
running through the
valley
,
which had the appearance in
some
parts of a natural meadow, there being
intervals
of
grass
plats of
considerable
extent
,
with hazel
copses
, and groupes of
young trees. The tall timber on the
height above, formed an agreeable
shade
,
and ledges of
stone
, worn
smooth
by the
water in
some
places, making
small
but
perpendicular falls in the current of the
water.
Dismounting
, and delaying a little
in this
spot
, to let the
horse
take a
mouthful
of the
grass
, and deliberating whether
if no habitation appeared, it might not be
agreeable enough to take a bed there on
the natural
sward
for the night; having a
small
quantity of
provisions
in Duncan's
wallet, and a
flask
of
whiskey
, which they
haltily put up at
setting
out.
At this
instant
, an aged and venerable
looking man
descended
from the
mountain
,
with a
slender
and delicately formed
young lad accompanying him, having on his
shoulder
the
carcase
of a racoon, which he
held by the hinder feet, and which
probably
ably
had been cut out of a hollow tree, or
taken in a trap, that afternoon.
The Captain thought with
himself
, that
he would have no great objection to have
an invitation from the old man and his
son
,
as he
supposed
him to be, to go home with
them, and lodge for the night; taking it
for granted from the appearance of
understanding
in the countenance, that they
were of a grade of education above the
bulk of the people of that country. It
so
happened, after explanation had taken
place, that he did receive an invitation,
and went home with them.
The
residence
was romantic,
situate
on
a
small
eminence on the north
side
of the
valley which running
east
and
west
, the
sun
struck
it with his
first
beams, and the
zephyrs, playing in the direct line of their
course
, fanned it in the
summer
heats. A
small
cascade
at a little
distance
, with a
sandy
bottom, afforded a delightful bathing
place; and the murmur of the falling water,
in the
silence
of the night, was favourable
to
sleep
.
It was a cabbin of an oblong figure,
perhaps twenty by twelve feet,
consisting
of two apartments, the one
small
, and
serving
as a kitchen, the other
answering
the
pur-
Vol.IV. L
purposes
of hall, parlour, and bed room.
The family
consisted
of the old man, the
young lad his
son
, and an attendant who
acted as cook, butler, and valet de
chambre
.
Duncan having rubbed and combed
the Captain's
horse
, and turned him
loose
to eat, was
stowed
away in the kitchen,
while the racoon was barbecued for
supper
,
and the Captain with the
host
, and
his
son
, were
pursuing
the explanation of
what they
respectively
were; being yet in
a great degree unknown to each other.
It appeared that the old man was the
Marquis de
Marnessie
, who had been an
emigrant from France, a
short
time after
the commencement of the
present
revolution
,
and had
served
some
time in a corps
of 10,000 men, which had been formed of
the nobility, under the combined princes,
against
the republic. Having been under
the
necessity
of abandoning his
seats
with
precipitation, he had been able to carry
with him, but a few
thousand
livres.
These
had been reduced in
supporting
himself
and friends in the
service
, and he had
brought but a few hundred to America This
country he had been led to
seek
,
disgusted
with the combined powers, when the
stipulations
of the convention of Pilnitz, began
to
to
transpire
, and the object appeared to
be, not
so
much to
support
the monarchy,
as to divide the country: chagrined
also
with that neglect, and even contumely,
experienced
from the German princes who
appeared to think with contempt of their
services
, and to
repose
their confidence
alone
,
in their own forces, and
discipline
.
Coming to America, he had retired
from the
sea
coast
, both to be out of the
way of the French democrats in the towns,
and in order to occupy a
less
expensive
residence
. He had found this valley
unappropriated
by the
state
, a warrant for an
hundred acres of which he obtained from
the land office, at the low rate of fifty
shillings
; and having cleared a
small
spot
,
had made a garden, and cultivated what
is called a patch of Indian corn,
subsisting
and
amusing
himself
and his family,
chiefly
by trapping and hunting in the
neighbouring
mountain;
wishing
to forget his
former feelings, and to live upon the earth
as
regardless
of its troubles as if buried
under
it. His cabbin was neat and clean,
with flooring of
split
timber, and
stools
made out of hewn logs. A few books,
and half a dozen
small
paintings, a fuzee,
and
and an old
sword
, being the only ornament
of its walls.
Having
supped
on the barbecuedracoon,
they took bed upon the planks, each
furnished
with a blanket, being the only
matress
,
or covering with which they were
provided.
A great deal of
conversation
had
passed
in the
course
of the evening; and
considerable
sympathy
of mind had taken place
on the part of the Marquis towards the
Captain,
considering
him in the light of
an emigrant with
himself
, having been
obliged
to
abscond
, from
sans
cullotte rage,
and popular
servor
, which though not of
the
same
height with that in France, yet
was of the
same
nature, and different only
in degree.
The invitation was given by the Marquis,
and accepted on the part of the Captain,
and to remain in that retirement for
some
weeks, until matters were
composed
, and
it might be
safe
for him to take his way
again
through the country, and return to
his dwelling. Duncan took care of the
horse
, chopped wood, carried water, and
assised
the French valet to barbecue
racoons
,
young bears,
squirrels
,
pheasants
,
partridges, and other game, that the
traps
traps, or fuzee and dog, of the Marquis
and his
son
, accompanied by the Captain,
could procure. Much
conversation
passed
in the mean time, on the affairs of
France;
sometimes
sitting
on a rock on
the
side
of the mountain, or under the
shade
of an elm tree in the
grassy
valley; or
walking out to
set
a trap; at other times,
in an evening in the cabbin, when they had
returned from the labour or
amusements
of the day.
These
conversations
were
chiefly in the French language, which the
Captain
spoke
very well; but in relating
any particulars of that
conversation
, we
shall
give it in
English
, to
save
the printer
the trouble of having it
translated
. And
we
shall
confine
ourselves
to a very few
particulars, meaning rather to
hasten
to
the action of the work, than to delay the
reader in an
episode
, longer than is
absolutely
necessary
to let
some
things be
matured
,
that are next to take place.

CHAP. XV.
IT was one of
those
temperate and
pleasant
evenings which in this climate
succeed
the autumnal equinox, that the
Marquis
and the Captain walking out
together
,
the
subject
of the
conversation
happened
to be the right of the people of France
to overthrow the monarchy, and
establish
a
republic. The Captain had read the
pamphlets
of Thomas Paine, entitled, Rights
of Man, and was a good deal
disposed
to
sabscribe
to the elementary principles of
that work; a leading doctrine of which is,
that at no time can the pact or
customs
of
ancestors
forestall
or take away the right
of
descendants
to frame whatever kind of
government they think proper.
This
must
be
understood
,
said
the
Marquis
,
like
most
other general
propositions
,
with
some
limitation, or exceptions; or at
least
some
explanation, before the mind of
all, at
least
of mine, can
acquiesce
in the
de-
deductions. It may
easily
be
supposed
that
I am not a proper
person
to
canvass
this
subject
, having been of that
class
of men,
who had all to
lose
, and nothing to gain, by
a revolution in the government of the
country
where I lived.
Nevertheless
, if my
feelings do not deceive me, I ought not to
be
considered
as a
person
under great
prejudices
.
For it
seems
to me, that I am
detached
from the world, and never more
expecting
to be
restored
to my country,
so
as to
live in it with reputation, or even with
safety
,
I am like a
person
with all his
senses
awake
,
and within a few
seconds
of death;
his vanity is
asleep
, his pride is gone; he
looks back upon his
pursuits
, and his hopes
with true
philosophy
, and makes a proper
estimate
of all the
acquisitions
, and all the
enjoyments of life. Or rather, I may be
thought to
resemble
a
disembodied
spirit
,
who no longer capable of enjoying the
false
glories of life, is not liable to be
seduced
by the appearance of them. The
shades
of departed men in the
elysian
fields as
imagined
by the ancients, and painted by the
poets, cannot be more
abstracted
from
former
impressions
, than I feel
myself
to
be, in this kind of
elysian
, and
posthumous
valley. When I
converse
with you
who
who have come from the world, and may
return to it, I am in the
situation
of the
Grecian worthies defunct of life, when
visited
by
Ulysses
. Achilles candidly
acknowledged
to him, that he had rather
live as a hired labourer with a poor man,
who had little food, than to rule over all
the
ghosts
. I will in like manner declare,
that
such
is my predilection for my
country
,
and that
ravishing
delight which I
would take, in breathing my native air,
and feeing my native
soil
, looking at the
buildings which were
accustomed
to
strike
my eyes in better days, that I would prefer
fishing
along the
streams
for my
precarious
and daily food, or digging the
soil
, and
procuring my
subsistence
with a
peasant
,
than to be the
President
of the United
States, deprived of the countenance of my
countrymen, and the view of that other
heavens, and that other earth. The
contempt
that I may have entertained, or at
least
the undervaluing
insperable
from my
situation
, which I may have felt, for the
undignifyed with nobility
amongst
us, is
totally gone: I could lay
myself
down,
with the
meanest
plebian, and call him my
brother.
Descent
, title, and fortune,
have
disappeared
from the eyes, and I
fee
see
nothing but man, in his rude and
original
excellence, as a
conversing
and
sociable
animal.
Nevertheless
, even in this
state
of mind, I cannot wholly
subscribe
to the
analysis
of Paine. Let us examine
his
position
.
The new born infant has a right to a
support
from its
ancestor
, until it
shall
be
of years to provide for
itself
; but has it a
right to his
estate
after it
shall
have been
of a mature age?
surely
not a natural
right; nor a right
sanctioned
in all
cases
even
by the municipal law; for the
ancestor
may alien, or
devise
away from the
heir. But if he claims as heir, or takes by
devise
, is it not under the artificial
establishment
of
society
, that he makes this
claim, or takes this gift?
shall
he not then
take this
estate
subject
to that government
in the principle and form of it, under which
this
estate
was acquired, and by which it is
preserved
to him? The civil relations that
exist
from the aggregate to him, are a law,
as well as the relations that
exist
from
individuals
.
Suppose
all minors of age at
one hour, and all
ancestors
just
departed
at the
same
moment, there might be
some
reason
then in
supposing
that the
descendants
were not bound by the
former
er
establishments
, but were at liberty to
introduce others; or the
descendants
emigrating, and occupying a new
soil
,
are certainly at liberty to frame new
structures
:
But not while a
single
ancestor
exists
,
who has an
interest
in the old
mansion
house
, and is attached to the building,
however Gothic;
because
the
ancestor
had
this right before the minor was born, and
his birth could not take it away. I
say
,
then, contrary to the principle of Paine,
that our
ancestors
having
established
an
hereditary
monarchy, it is not in the
power
of the
descendants
to change it. They
may remove from under it, if they will,
but not pull the
house
down about our
heads.
The early
feudalist
,
whose
acquisitions
,
and
possession
of them, depended on that
military
subordination
and tenure which
gave
rise
to the
system
, when he took his
place in it either as a
chestain
, or a
vassal
,
submitted
to it; he had his voice in this
social
compact; and
shall
his
descendant
be
allowed to unhinge the tenure, and change
the fabric which was not of his building?
shall
he claim the advantages of that
species
of government to which he has been
introduced
,
and not
submit
to the
inequalities
qual-
of it? or
shall
it be changed but
by
universal
consent
?
shall
even a
majority
change it? No:
because
each
individual
is, in the language of the law, a joint
tenant, and has a right,
per my & per tant,
in the part, and in the whole. It can no
more take away the right an individual
has in the
system
of government, than the
right he has in his
estate
, held by a prior
law. Upon
investigation
, it will be found
a
question
more of power than of right;
just
as in
these
woods, I take the racoons
and rabbits, not that I conceive
mysself
to
have any right to have come from the
banks of the Loire to make
these
depredations
,
but that having come, I have the
skill
to do it.
The Captain was led to
smile
at
these
last
words of the Marquis, as favouring of
misanthropy
,
equalizing the
case
of brute
animals with men. I can
easily
excuse
,
said
the Captain, this
sally
of your mind,
and
must
resolve
it into the wounds your
feelings have received from the
reverse
of
your fortune, and the dreadful outrages
which have taken place, in the
course
of
the revolution, from the fury of the human
mind. Nor would I call in
question
wholly
the
justness
of your
position
, with regard
to
to the right of changing a mode of
government
.
Nevertheless
, it may admit of
some
discussion
in the generality, and be
so
bounded as to leave
some
great
cases
out
of the rule. I grant you that the
descendant
,
on the principle of natural right, can
claim nothing more of the
personal
labour
of the
ancestor
, or of his
estate
, than
support
,
until he
shall
be of an age which gives
strength
of mind and body to enable him
to provide for
himself
. But does he not
possess
by his birth, a right to
so
much of
the
soil
as is
necessary
for his
subsistence
?
you will
say
he may emigrate. But
suppose
all adjoining known lands already
peopled; he cannot emigrate without
committing
injustice
upon others. He
must
therefore remain. How to preclude
him from all right to think, or act in
affairs
of government, with a view to
improve
,
and to improve is to change, is
restraining
the mind of man, in a
particular
capable of the
greatest
extent, and
upon
which depends, more than on all things
else
, the perfection of our
species
. I
would put it upon this point; is it
conducive
to an amelioration of the
state
of life,
and likely to produce a greater
sum
of
happiness
,
to innovate upon
established
forms,
or
or to let them remain? It is true, indeed,
that when we
consider
the throws and
convulsions
with which a change in
government
is
usually
attended, it ought not
to be lightly attempted; and nothing
but an extreme
necessity
for a reform can
justify
it. It is
almost
as
impossible
,
comparing
a
physical
with a moral difficulty,
to change a government from
despotism
to
liberty, without violence, as to
dislodge
a
promontory from its
base
, by any other
means, than mining and gunpowder.
Of that I am convinced,
said
the
Marquis
;
for there never was a people more
generally
disposed
to a degree of reform,
than the people of France, at the
commencement
of the revolution. The
writings
of
philosophers
had prevaded the
minds of the
highest
orders, and it had
become
the
passion
of the times to lean
towards
a certain extent of liberty. It had
become the
wish
of the good, and the
humour
of the weak, to advance the
condition
of the
peasantry
. As an
instance
of
this, I
myself
had written a book, entitled,
Sur le bonheur de Campagne,
with the
express
view of depicting the
depressed
situation
of the common people in the
country
,
Vol. IV. M
and the means of
raising
them from
that condition.
But a reform once begun, it was found
impossible
to
arrest
it at a middle point.
It may be
resolved
into a
thousand
causes
,
but the great
cause
was, the
insatiable
nature
of the human mind, that will not be
contented with what is moderate. For
though there were
doubtless
a
considerable
portion of the nobility who were
opposed
to any diminution of their power and
pageantry
;
yet, on the other hand, as great
an evil
existed
in the
wish
of extreme
equality
in others; or rather, a
wish
to bring all
things to a perfect level, that from thence
they might begin to
ascend
themselves
.
There began to be
insincerity
on the part
of the court, and
licentiousness
on the part
of the people; and finally a
contest
, lurid
and dreadful, like the column of dark clouds
edged with blue, and fraught with
lightning
.
A
contest
so
terrible, that I have
thought
myself
happy in
escaping
from it,
even though I have been obliged to call
upon the rocks and the mountains to
cover
me in this valley.
The above is a
sample
of
those
conversations
which took place, between the
Marquis and the Captain, during the
space
of
of
some
weeks which the Captain
spent
in
this rural and
obscure
recess
. In the
mean time, the Count, the
son
of the
Marquis
,
had been
dispatched
occasionally
through the
settlement
, and to the village
where the late outrage had been
perpetrated
,
in order to learn what had become of
the revenue officer, as
also
to
ascertain
the
slate
of the public mind, and when it
might be
safe
for the Captain to
shew
himself
in public, and return by the main
road to his habitation.
Nothing had been heard of O'Regan,
but accounts the
most
unfavourable were
obtained of the
disposition
of the people.
The flame of
opposition
had
spread
generally
,
and the whole country appeared to
be involved in a common burning. They
had
demolished
all
inspection
houses
, far
and near;
assembled
in committees, and
framed
resolves
of the
utmost
violence.
The obnoxious were
banished
; and even
the lukewarm in the
cause
were
threatened
with the
destruction
of their goods,
and injury to their
persons
. They had
begun to frame guillotines, and to talk
of taking off the heads of traitors to the
cause
.
The Captain was not a little alarmed at
these
these
proceedings; but the Marquis who
had
seen
the machine of the guillotine in
actual operation, was
seized
with a horrid
fear; and he
almost
imagined to
himself
that he
saw
it moving of its own accord
towards him; and his
reason
told him, that
it was not all improbable but that it might
be brought to approach him very
speedily
,
as the
same
sans
cullotte anarchy and
violence
began to
shew
itself
in
these
regions,
as had broke out in France.
CHAP.XVI.
IT may now be time to make
some
enquiry
after the unfortunate
excise
officer
,
who had been treated in the manner
we have mentioned.
The evening the outrage had been
committed
on him, he had run
several
miles,
naked as he was; if a man may be
said
to
be naked, that is
invested
with a layer of
viscous
fluid, and the
adhesion
of birds
feathers to cover him; through much
danger
ger
from the country people, who were ill
affected to his office: He had at length
gained the
recesses
of a
forest
, where he
thought
himself
safe
for the night; until
near morning, when the barking of wolves
at no great
distance
, as he thought, led
him to apprehend the being devoured by
these
animals, who might take him for an
object of their prey. To
escape
this, he
had thought it
adviseable
to climb a
spreading
beech tree, and there remained
until after
sun
rise
, when two hunters
coming along at that early hour,
descried
him
amongst
the branches; and not
without
much
surprize
and
astonishment
. At
first
they took him for a bear; but
seeing
the feathers, it was decided that he
must
be of the fowl kind.
Nevertheless
his face
and form, which appeared to be human,
made him a
monster
in creation, or at
least
a new
species
of animal, never before
known in
these
woods.
They at
first
hesitated
whether to take
him down by a
shot
, or to
pass
on and
leave him
unmolested
. But at length it
was determined to
pass
on for the
present
,
as if they had not
seen
him, and to
rouse
the
settlement
, to take him with dogs, and
the help of men. It would be a valuable
ti-
M 2
tiquision
to have
such
a creature to carry
to the great towns for a
show
. It might
be a fortune to a man. This being
resolved
on, one of the hunters was
dispatched
to
rouse
the
settlement
, while his comrade
in the mean time, had taken his
station
on
an eminence at no great
distance
, to watch
the motions of the wild creature, and give
information of his change of
situation
.
The officer in much melancholy of mind
had
descended
from the beech, and was
sitting
on the point of a rock, looking about
him like a bald eagle, when a couple of
stout
fellows came
suddenly
behind him,
with the folds of ropes, and entrapped his
body,
so
that he could not move his arms,
which they took to be wings, but was as
tightly laced as a
ship
's yard arm, when
the
sails
are furled to prepare for a
tempest
.
A cage having been made and put into
the bed of a waggon, he was conveyed
to the capital, when the proprietors,
after
having
published
an
advertisement
,
began to exhibit him as a
curiosity
, for the
sum
of a quarter dollar to each grown
person
,
and an eighth of a dollar to the
children
of families
whose
parents brought
them with them.
In
In a
short
time, this uncommon
creature
,
as it was thought to be, became the
subject
of general
conversation
; and the
Philosophical
Society had heard of it.
Having called a
special
meeting, they
dispatched
two members to
ascertain
and
report
the nature of the animal, in a
memoir
to be
inserted
in their
transactions
.
The two members accordingly
requested
of the proprietors an opportunity of a
leisurely
examination of the animal, and paid
them a quarter dollar each extraordinary,
for this indulgence. The proprietors were
disposed
, as was natural, to
assist
with
some
particulars of fiction, the
singular
qualities
of the animal they had in charge. They
related, that when they
first
saw
it, in its
flying from the mountain, it was
just
alighting
on the tree top; that having
taken
it, they had at
first
offered it boiled
and
roasted
flesh
, but this it
refused
; but
that at length it had come to eat
flesh
both
roasted
and
sodden
with
considerable
gout,
and
sometimes
even with rapacity. This
was
false
, by the bye, for they had tried
the officer with raw
flesh
at
first
, which he
had
refused
, and would eat only
roasted
or boiled.
The proprietors informed, that when
first
first
taken, its cries, or voice, was of a
mixed
sound
, between that of a wild cat
and heron; but that it had come to have
some
imitation of the human voice, and
even articulation, and might from that
circumstance
be probably a
species
of the
parrot.
The
philosophers
noted all this, and
doubtless
made a proper
use
of the
particulars
,
in determining the genus of the
animal. For the
last
thing that a
virtuoso
ought to
question
, is the truth of facts. It
is by taking facts as granted, that an
hypothesis
is
most
easily
established
.
The
transactions
of the Society have not
been yet
published
.
Nevertheless
we have
been favoured with the report of the
members
on this
occasion
, with leave to
publish
it, having
so
immediate a relation to this
work. It is as follows:
The animal of which an account is
now to be given, was
asleep
when we
made our
visit
; and the keepers were
unwilling
to
disturb
him, having been kept
awake, they
said
, too much for
some
time
past
, by the frequency of people coming
to
see
him. However, this
circumstance
gave us an opportunity which we would
not
otherwise
have had, of
observing
him
while
while
asleep
. He lay with his head upon
his right
shoulder
, and his hinder legs,
drawn up to his belly, in the manner of
the dog, or bear. The drawing his breath,
and his
snoring
, is that of a man. He has
hair upon his head, with a mixture of
feathers
;
but upon his body there is nothing
but feathers, not in the manner of other
fowls, if fowl this may be called,
smooth
and clean, but growing through a
viscous
substance
resembling
tar, and intermixed
with it; in this particular differing from
the bird kind in general, who by means
of a
spinal
gland
secrete
an oily
substance
,
with which they
besmear
and
dress
their
feathers; for here the oily or
viscous
substance
is
itself
mixed with the feathers, and
oozing from the
skin
. Nor are the
feathers
here, as in fowls in general, lying
all one way, but in various directions, as
if nature had given them to
sprout
out at
random. But what is
most
extraordinary,
the
stems
are frequently protruded, and
the downy part
inserted
in the
skin
.
Such were our
observations
while he lay
asleep
.
After half an hour the keepers having
awaked him, he got up from his
straw
by
turning on his back,
stretching
out his
fore
fore legs, or wings, if they may be
so
called
,
raising
himself
on his rump, and then
by
resting
on one paw,
rising
with a
slow
and
easy
motion, to his feet. It may
seem
a
catachresis
in language to talk of the
face of a
beast
;
nevertheless
we
shall
use
this
phrase
, for though in great part
covered
with feathers, and the
same
viscous
matter with the body, yet in
shape
it has
the appearance of a human face, full as
much or more, than the baboon, or
others
of the ape
species
. It cannot be
said
to laugh, but rather grin, though once or
twice in our
presence
, you would have
thought that it exhibited a dilatation of the
oscular
muscles
, as if attempting to laugh.
The eye is of a grey colour, and the
look wild, but
steady
, like that of a
person
under an
impression
of amazement
and wonder. The neck, and whole form
of the body, and even the hinder legs,
have a
strong
resemblance
of the human.
Were it not for the feathers, a
person
on a
superficial
view might
mistake
the wings
for arms, being attached to the body by
a
shoulder
blade, and the claws
resembling
the fingers of a Negro.
If this animal is to be referred to the
quadruped, or
beast
kind, it would
most
natur-
naturally be
classed
with the Ouran
Outang
,
or Wild Man of Africa: If with the
bird kind, we
shall
be totally at a
loss
to
assign
the genus. For though it has a
head and face not unlike the ouzel, or
the grey owl, yet in the body it has no
resemblance
.
Nevertheless
we
should
certainly
give it a place
amongst
fowls, were
it not that it has ribs
instead
of the lamina,
or
side
plates, which are peculiar to the
winged race alone: as
also
,
because
we
have
reason
to think it has an epiglottis,
from the articulation of its
sounds
, by
which it has come to imitate our
speech
,
with a pronunciation not unlike that
kind of brogue, which we remark in
some
of the
west
country
Irish
. It appears to
want the ingluvies or craw; but has a
gizzard
,
and
digests
its food by the
dissolving
power of the
gastric
juices.
All things
considered
, we incline to
think that it is an animal of a
species
wholly
new, and of a middle nature between
a bird and a
beast
; yet
so
widely
differing
from a bat, as not to be
classed
with it.
This
discovery
leads to new and
important
considerations
. We do not
undertake
to decide for the Society; but
shall
venture to
suggest
some
particulars.
this
This animal would
seem
to form the link
between the brutal and the human
species
;
being nearer to it in
some
particulars
than the Ouran Outang
itself
; and
especially
in the evident articulation of
certain
sounds
. Articulation was with
the ancients, the
distinguishing
characteristic
of the human kind. The poet
Homer
has the epither frequently,
Meropon,
Antbropon:
articulate,
speaking
men. Yet
we find from this
discovery
, that
articulation
,
at
least
to
some
extent, is not
peculiar
to man alone. This is an
incidental
characteristic
, given by the poet; but
the
distinguishing
marks has been given
with more
subtilty
of
observation
, by his
scholar
Aristotle
,
whose
definition is that
of
Animal bipes implumis
. A two legged,
unfeathered animal: For though it might
be contended with
some
plausibility
, that
this animal has two legs; yet it is
evidently
feathered; not indeed with the long
and
strong
plumage of the
ostrich
, but with
the down of a
goose
, or duck. This
animal
,
like man, has not a tail.
Nevertheless
it has the os coccygis, or termination
of the
spinal
bone, longer than in man; as
was
ascertained
by one of us, who in the
interval of his
sleeping
, felt his rump. Not
that
that we would draw from this any
conclusion
in favour of the
hypothesis
of
Monboddo
,
that men had once tails; but that
in the
scate
of animals, there is a gradual
nearing of
distance
, from having long tails,
to the having no tail at all.
The
most
important enquiry comes
now to be
investigated
, namely, whether
this be an animal new to
discovery
, or
actually new to the world, and
just
lately
come into
existence
in the natural
kingdom
.
No account of it having been
heretofore
given by any traveller in America,
either from the information of the natives,
or
personal
observation
of their own,
founds a
strong
presumption
that it is of
a novel breed of creatures; but that it is
prepared to
preserve
its
species
, with a
female
,
may be inferred, from the
circumstance
of nature having
furnished
it with
testicles
.
The idea of original production,
involves
in it the late
hypothesis
of
Macilhattan
,
in his
treatise
,
De Seminibus,
that
nature has within
herse
f an aboriginal
productive
power;
so
that as
some
animals
disappear
from the earth, the Mammoth
for
instance
, others
spring
up, that were
never known before. Which
hypothesis
,
by
N
by the bye,
so
far as
respects
the extinction
of animals, receives
considerable
countenance
from the ancient relations of the
gorgon
,
the hydra, &c. and the
less
remote
allusions
to winged gryphins, orchs, &c. If this
should
be found to be the fact, it may be
suggested
whether it would be going too
far to
say
, that it might be in the
compass
of human
research
, to
discover
the
subtil
combination of
causes
and effects,
necessary
to the production of life, and the
formation
of a living creature; and that the
time might not be far
distant
, when
ingenious
chymists
might undertake and
accomplish
the
analysis
of matter, and
synthesis
of
composition
,
so
as to be able to
make animals, to
those
who
should
bespeak
them; as a workman would make
articles of furniture for a hall or
assembly
room. This would
save
much expence,
in feeding, and providing them for food,
or for the
purposes
of labour, and burdens.
We have thought it
sufficient
to
suggest
this,
and
propose
it to the
industry
and
ingenuity
of the learned in
philosophic
science
.
So far the memoir.
The
society
expressed
their approbation
of it; and it was
proposed
to make a
purchase
of this animal, for the
purpose
of
ex-
examining it more fully, in their own
hall, and
possibly
of
sending
it to the
societies
abroad, for their examination
also
.
This
proposition
was adopted, and the
same
members appointed to drive a bargain with
the proprietors, for the
subject
of their
shew
.
When the deputation came forward,
and began to traffic with the keepers,
proposing
a
purchase
of the
curiosity
in their
possession
, the revenue officer, in the
cage
just
by,
raised
what is called the
Irish
howl, in a
most
pitiable manner;
recollecting
what the Captain had told him,
on a former
occasion
, with regard to the
use
to which they would apply him, when
they
should
have him in their power.
God love your
shouls
, my dear
masters
,
said
he, that have taken me in the wild
woods. I care not
sat
you make o'd me,
a wild
baste
, or a turky buzzard; or a
fish
o'd de varer, while I gat good mate
to ate, and clean
straw
to ly down upon;
but for the
sake
o'd de holy fathers, do
not
sell
me to defe
filosophers
, that will
cut me up as you would a dead cat, and
put my
skin
upon a pitchfork,
just
to
plase
deir own fancies; rader let me
stay
where
I am, and
shew
me to de good paple, dat
gape
gape and

, but keep deir teeth in deir
mouths, and luke
foolish
, but dont affer
to bite.
The
philosophers
assured
him, that his
apprehensions
were without foundation;
having not the
least
intention of diffecting,
at
least
until he died a natural death.
Doubtless
, it might be an object, to
ascertain
from the internal
structure
of his
body
,
to what genus or
class
of animals he
might belong:
nevertheless
, they were
persuaded
, the
society
would content
themselves
,
with the
observations
drawn from
external
structure
, at
least
for
some
time.
On this turning round to the proprietors,
they
resumed
the
conversation
relative to
a
purchase
; the
supposed
animal
continuing
to vociferate and roar horribly.
In the mean time, the affair of this
wild man,
beast
, bird,
fish
, or whatever
it was, began to make a
noise
in the town;
the people who had come to
see
it, being
divided in opinion;
some
believing it to
be a
monster
, or new animal in the
creation
;
others
disposed
to be of opinion,
and others confidently
asserting
, that it
was a real man.
Coming to the ear of the chief
justice
of
the
slate
, it occured to him, that if a man,
the
the confining him in that manner was a
restraint
upon the liberty of the
subject
;
and ought not to be permitted in a
country
where the laws govern. Accordingly,
he had
issued
his writ of Habeas Corpus
to the keepers, commanding them
forthwith
to bring before him, the animal in
their
possession
, and to
assign
the
cause
of
this detainer. The officer came forward
at the moment the keepers were about to
close
the bargain with the
philosophers
,
and
shewed
his writ. They were obliged to
obey; and came forward with their charge
before the chief
justice
and
associate
judges,
in open court then
sitting
, alledging
property
in
themselves
by caption, and
employing
counsel
to
support
this allegation.
The court having
assigned
counsel
to
support
the Habeas Corpus, the argument
began:
Counsellor
Patch
first
.
May it
please
your honours,
I take this to be an animal in which
there can be no property
absolute
or
qualified
,
being
fera natara,
or of an
untamed
nature,
such
as a panther, or a
buffalo; of which it is laid down no
larceny
can be committed, as not being the
the
subject
of property. 4 Black. 235;
referring for authorities to 1 Hal. P. C. 511.
Fost
N 2
Fost
. 366. 1 Hawk. P. C. 94. Here
counfeller
Patch read the authorities.
Councellor Catch in reply: But by the
same
authorities, it is laid down, that
animals
fera natura,
or wild, when
reclaimed
,
or confined, and may
serve
for
food, may be the
subject
of property, as
deer
inclosed
in a park,
fish
in a trunk,
or
pheasants
or partridges in a mew.
But is it conceded, that this animal can
serve
for food?
rejoined
counsellor
Patch.
The
question
to be
considered
in the
first
place, interrupted the chief
justice
, is
whether this creature is of the brutal or
the human kind. Speak to that point.
Counsellor
Scratch, as
amicus curia
observed
,
that this being a
question
of fact,
was
most
properly determinable by a jury.
Counsellor
Patch thought not, as the trial
by
inspection
in the
case
of infancy, which
was within the province of the court, was
analogous to this. The court were of
opinion
with
counsellor
Scratch, and
proposed
to the
counsel
for the thing in
custody
,
to bring a writ
de Homine
Replegiando
,
or
Replevin,
for the body of a man,
as the proper writ to bring the
case
before
a jury; or that an
issue
might be made
upon the return to the
Habeas Corpus,
by
con-
consent
; and in that
shape
let it be tried.
It was agreed; property pleaded, the
issue
made up, and the jury about to be
impanelled
.
Counsellor
Patch under the principle of
an alien having a right to a jury
de
medietata
lingua,
demanded, that the jury
should
consist
of one half
beasts
.
Curia advifari vult,
and in the mean
time
desired
the
counsel
to
search
for
precedents
.
No
instance
was found of the
jury
de medietata lingua,
being carried
so
far as this, and the motion was
overruled
.
The jury being now
sworn
, the
counsel
for the keepers, offered the two members
of the
Philosophical
Society, who had
examined
him, to
establish
his brutality;
this evidence was offered on the principle,
that it was peculiarly within the province
of their
studies
to
ascertain
a point of this
nature, and were therefore the proper
witnesses
;
as in a
case
within the
custom
of
merchants, individuals of this occupation
are
usally
called. According to the
maxim
of the civil law,
Unicuique, in arte
sua
,
perito credendum
est
.
Exception to this evidence, that they
were
interested
, having had an eye to the
pur-
purchase
of this thing, and actually in
negociation
for it.
The objection was overruled, as going
to the credibility, not the competency.
The
witnesses
were clear that this thing
was not of the human race, though as to
what
class
of brute animals it was to be
referred
,
they were not yet prepared to
decide
.
To the weight of this evidence
counsellor
Catch
opposed
the evidence of nature
herself
; the thing had a human voice and
speech
, that of a
west
country
Irishman
;
no
instance
of which was to be found in
any
natural
historian
that had ever written.
He would call upon the gentleman to
produce
any authority to that effect.
Counsellor
Patch, was not prepared with
an authority to prove, that
beasts
had been
found that could
speak
Irish
; but that it
was no uncommon thing in early ages, and
in many countries, for
beasts
to
speak
fome language;
such
as Latin, Greek;
for which he might refer the gentleman to
the
Aesopi
Fabulae
, or
those
of
Phedrus;
nor was he without an authority at hand,
to prove that even in more modern times,
there were many
beasts
who could
speak
Englis
; this authority was that well known
book,
book, The
History
of Reynard the Fox;
which he now produced, and from which
he read
passages
.
The court thought the authority in
point, and the evidence not to be got
over
,
and directed the jury to find
accordingly
;
which they did, in favour of the
keepers, and the Habeas Corpus, was
dismissed
,
and the thing remanded to
custody
.
The members after this,
struck
a bargain
the more
easily
with the keepers; as they
had been a good deal alarmed at the
risk
they had run of having this property taken
from them. The Society after having
retained
the
curiosity
a year or
so
, and
ascertained
its
structure
and properties,
proposed
sending
it to
some
of the foreign
societies
,
who had
expressed
a with to have a
an occural examination of it
also
. The
preference
was given to the
societies
of France;
and it was accordingly
shipped
in a brig
of Blair M`Clenachen, that was bound to
Nantz. At this place on coming
ashore
,
the cage, by rolling and tubling in it,
having worn off the tar and feathers from
his back-
side
, he was
mistaken
for a
sans
culotte; and the mob
rising
, broke the
inclosure
, and let him out. I have not
heard
on, and he was greatly obnoxious with
the army and judiciary. When the troops
had attained the point of
destination
, and
the judicial examinations had been
set
on
foot with regard to the conduct of
individuals
,
it was always a principal
question
,
What do you know of Captain Farrago?
They had heard of his man Duncan, and
thinking that he
must
be acquainted with
the
secrets
of the Captain, orders were
given to apprehend him, under the idea of
a criminal.
The examinations were conducted with
great
dispatch
, many hands making light
work, there being a
vast
number of
assistant
interrogators, and
deposition
-takers, in
the capacity of journeymen, and
apprentices
.
It was a good
school
for
students
of
the law, and young clerks who came out
on the expedition. It is true, they were
not very capable of taking the true
sense
of
what was
stated
in the
testimony
, nor very
careful to take down for and
against
;
but the giving them a habit of
asking
questions
, and
spelling
words, was of
more
consequence
to the public, than the
doing
justice
to people that had lived in a
remote corner of the commonwealth.
Duncan having been
arrested
, was put
un-
under guard with
several
others. When
he came to his examination, he was
asked
the following
question
, and made the
following
answers
: Are you aquainted with
John Farrago? I hae a
short
acquaintance
since
I hae been in his
service
, about a
month or twa. Has he ever
conversed
with
you on the
subject
of politics? He wad na
converse
wi' me, he kens I dinna
understand
them. Do you not know him to be
an
insurgent
? Indeed I dinna ken ony
sik
a thing. I believe he is no
just
vera right
in the head, but I dinna believe he tuk
any
part in
stirring
up the
insurrection
. He
has gane about the kintra for
some
time
past
, in an odd way, wi' ane Teague
O'Regan
,
an
Irishman
, that got to be a
gauger
,
and came out to this kintra, to
set
up
in the
business
, and made a' this broil;
and
since
he parted wi' him, he has
employed
me in the like capacity, no much to
my profit, if I am
pursued
, and put in fear
o' my life, and to hide three weeks in a
glen for fear o' the mob, and now to be
hanged for hanged ha'ing been in the kintra; and
what is mare, to be made a
witness
against
the Captain, when I hae nathing to
say
o' him. The deel tak me, gin I
swear
a word to wrang my
conscience
. That is
the
the
short
and the lang o' it. Sae ye need
say
na mare about it, but gae to the
examination
o'
some
other body, for U hae
told ye a' that I hae to
say
about it.
Duncan was
dismissed
, and the Captain
himself
; and falling into the hands of an
assistant
examiner of
sense
, his account
and explanation was
understood
, and he
acquitted from the
suspicion
of having
swerved
from the duty of a good citizen.
Setting out after this with Duncan, he
returned to his home; having experienced
a number of incidents, and
some
danger
in his travels,
sufficient
for one ramble.
