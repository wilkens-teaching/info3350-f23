VOL. II.2
A NIGHT
ON THE
TERRAPIN ROCKS.
CHAPTER I.
All
persons who have visited Niagara
(and who has not?) are aware, that the rocks
stretching in a broken chain from Goat
Island
far out into the Horseshoe Fall, giving
foundation to the bridge by which the visiter
reaches the brink of the cataract, are
designated
as the Terrapin Rocksa name scarce
worthy the dignity of their position, but
rendered
somewhat appropriate by a
resemblance
,
which fancy readily traces in them,
to a cluster of gigantic turtles, sprawling in
the torrent. They lie confusedly along the
verge of the watery precipice, extending a
distance of a hundred yards or more from the
island, of which they seem to have formed
originally a partthe ruins of a jutting
promontory
long since washed away. The
bridgea low path of logs and planks, as is
well knowngives access to many of these
fragments: others again may be reached
without such assistance, from the island: and
the adventurous spirit, tempted by the very
wildness of the exploit, will often seek among
them some convenient perch, where, poised
perhaps over the tremendous gulf, with the
flood on either side of him, shooting furiously
by, he enjoys a spectacle of unequalled
magnificence
in itself, and to which the feelings
inspired by the situation add double
sublimity
.
The bridge, at its termination, projects
several feet over the fall; and here the visiter
may enjoy both the scene and the excitement
of a half-fancied peril, without encountering
the risk, which would certainly attend a
scramble among the rocks, by any one not
having his nervous propensities under full
command. A fallthe consequence of a
single mis-stepinto a current that rather
darts than runs, and a whirl down an abyss
of a hundred and sixty feet perpendicular
depthare consequences that may easily
happen; and the thought of them is, in
general
,
sufficient to keep visiters on the bridge.
Yet use doth breed a habit in a man, I do
not think I possess any philosophic contempt
of raging billows: and I have, especially,
very poor and unhappy brains for looking
down precipices. Yet there was something
in the glory of Niagara that chased away my
fearsit may be, swallowed them up in the
all-engrossing passion of delight; something
in the sublime position of those naked rocks,
too, which, when once reached, substituted
for trembling apprehension a nobler feeling
a feeling as of enthronement, and rule, and
power over the majestic torrent.
One day, while sitting upon one of these
grim thrones, speculating, after the true
motley-manner, upon the ever-falling flood,
in which fancy saw represented the river of
human life, with the cataract of death, over
which it was eternally falling, and wondering
what difference it made to the drop pitching
down the steep, whether rocks had vexed, or
smoother channels lulled it into security, on
the way; my attention was attracted to a
stranger, whom I had previously noticed on
the bridge, and who, besides myself, was the
only living creature at that moment to be
seen on, or near, the fall. He stood
grasping
the rail of the bridge, pale, agitated, and
eyeing myself, as I soon found, with a look
that I interpreted into a call for assistance
a call which terror, sickness, or some
unknown
cause, I supposed, prevented his
making
by word of mouth.
I left my rock, which was only rendered
temporarily accessible, in consequence of a
huge log having lodged against it, as well as
against another nearer the bridge, forming a
stepping-tree that the first swell of the flood
must wash away, and hurried to the
stranger's
assistance, without, however, having
any very clear idea what ailed him. As I
stepped upon the bridge, he seized me by the
hand, and with the fervent ejaculation,
Heaven be praised! hurried me up to his
side, pretty much with the air of one who, in
mortal affright himself, has just snatched
another out of imminent danger. Heaven
be praised! he cried; I was frightened for
you; or, rather, II Here he became
confused, as if awaking from a dreamI
was frightened for myself!
2*
All this was very mysterious and
incomprehensible
to me; which my countenance
showing, the gentlemanfor indeed he was
a man both of good appearance and manners
exclaimed, I beg your pardon: I believe
I have been acting like a fool, and talking
like one. But the appearance of a human
being sitting on that rock, unmanned me: I
thought it was
myself
, andand. In short,
sir, I scarce know what I am saying. You
seem amazed at my trepidation. Yet I can
tell you of an adventure on that rock, which
will excuse my weakness. Yesthat is, if
you will but walk with me to some secure
placeto the island; for, I freely admit, my
thoughts are
here
too much disordered.
My curiosity being raised, and somewhat
of an interest excited in the stranger, whose
years, for he was in the prime of life, his tall
and robust frame, and manly countenance,
seemed inconsistent with the weakness of
fear,I readily attended him to the island.
His agitation decreased, as we approached it;
and, by and by, when we had plunged amid
its sweet bowers, walking towards its upper
borders, whither he begged me to accompany
him, it vanished so entirely, that he was able
like myself, to note and admire the
numberless
beauties, which make almost an elysium
of this fairy island.
Was there ever, indeed, a spot so lovely
as Goat Island? Couched on the breast of
the fall, surrounded by the mighty floods, that
go rushing by with the velocity, and ten times
the power and fury, of the winda very
hurricane
of waters; lashed, beaten, worried,
perpetually devoured by them; it lies amid
the roar and convulsion, its little islets around
it, green, lovely, and peaceful, an Eden on
the face of chaos. Hid in its groves of beech
and maple, of larch and hemlock, oak, linden
and tuliptree; in its peeping glades,
embowered
with vines and ivies, and towering sumachs
that cluster rich and red as Persian roses all
around; the raspberry hanging from the bush,
the strawberry and the bluebell glimmering
together on the ground; the bee and the
butterfly
,
the grasshopper and the humming-bird
pursuing their pretty tasks all around; the
sparrow and the mocking bird singing aloft;
the dove cooing, the woodpecker tapping, in
the shade; you might here dream away an
anchoritish existence, scarce conscious of
the proximity of the cataract, whose voice
comes to your ear, a softened murmur, that
seems only the hum of other birds and insects
a little further off. A step brings you to its
borders, and here you look over a wall of
torrent
to the world, from which you are yet
sundered far enough to satisfy even the
complaining
Timon. Here you may muse and
moralize over man, that quintessence of
dust, and yet indulge the yearning to be near
him of which no misanthrope can wholly
divest himself; here, in your island, your
desert inaccessible,
Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
you may rail at the monster, without being
exasperated by, or entirely banished from, his
presence.
Following my new friend through the
lovely
walks of the island, and still keeping on
its western borders, we reached a charming
nook, where a cluster of several rocky and
wooded islets was separated from Goat Island
only by a narrow channel, through which,
however, the current flowed with great
tumult
and violence. The trunk of a spruce
tree, half submerged by the flood, in which it
shook with perpetual tremor, offered a
passage
to the nearer islet to such as were
inclined
to avail themselves of it. But that
was not I; I liked not the appearance of the
aguish log, over which, every now and then,
the torrent made a complete breach, leaping
into the air like a gallant and impatient
hunter taking a five-barred gate, and then
plunging down again to pursue its impetuous
course. Nor was my companion a whit
more disposed to the adventure than
myself
.
On the contrary, he gazed upon the
foamy bridge with some share of the
agitation
he had previously displayed. From
this, however, he soon recovered, and even
laughed at his weakness; after which, sitting
down with me at the roots of an ancient
tree, the roaring channel at our feet, he
related
the incident of adventure the mere
allusion to which had aroused my curiosity.
He was, he gave me to understand a citizen of
the Westof Illinois; but born in the Empire
State, which he was now revisiting with no
other object than to renew a brief
acquaintance
with the scenes of his youth. But it
is proper he should speak his story in his
own words.
CHAPTER II.
My
earliest breath was drawn in the great
metropolis; from which, I thank heaven, I
have escaped to become a freeman of the
prairies. The slavery of a city life, not to
speak of the more intolerable bondage of
trade, I early learned to detest; and I as early
made an effort to throw off my chains, and
turn savage. You know what the
philosopher
I
believe it is Humboldtsays: `It is
with the beginning of civilization as with its
decline: man appears to repent of the
restraint
which he has imposed on himself by
entering into society; and he seeks the
solitude
,
and loves it, because it restores him to
his former freedom. I was beginning to be
civilizedthat is, I was beginning to make a
fortune, which is one and the same thing
when the impulse seized me, and I turned
my face to the West. My first place of
sojourn was the banks of this very river, the
glorious Niagara, on which, as you perceive,
I can scarce look without starting up to run
away;not that I am very deeply galled by
the looks of civilization it now wearsits
towns and cities, its shops and taverns, its
mills and factories with which they are, here
at the falls, striving to mar Heaven's
handy-work
;
but because every look recalls to
memory
a terrible adventure that once befel me
upon it, and which has converted my once
ardent love of the majestic tide into fear and
abhorrence.
I was already wearying of the increase of
population around me, but not yet able to
tear myself from scenes so lovely and
beloved
,
when the projectors of a very
pardonable
innovation succeeded in throwing a
bridge over to Goat Island, and thus opened
to the eye of man haunts that were only
before
accessible through means the most
difficult
and dangerous. These little islets before
us, and, I believe, several others on the east
side, were brought under subjection in the
same manner; and the project of bridging the
Terrapin Rocks was also talked of; though
that was left to be completed at a later
period. The Terrapin Rocks still lay amid
the curling billows, on the verge of the fall,
as they had lain for a thousand years,
untouched
and unapproached by the foot of
man. Often have Iamong the first to
ramble
up and down the island, admiring its
virgin
solitudes, its beauties yet uninvaded and
undefiledsat upon yonder bluff, viewing
those blackened rocks, and longing for the
commencement and completion of the
projected
bridge, that I might be upon them.
That very rock upon which you sat, I had
fixed upon, in prospect, as the seat from
which I should survey the flood, making a
pleasure of fear, and enjoying the luxury of
danger. It is true, that rock appeared
entirely
isolated from the others; but that, with
its exposed situation on the very edge of the
precipice, formed its charm. I saw, or
fancied
,
that I might reach it by the same means
accident provided for youby lodging a log
against it. I was thus, in intention, guilty
of the act, which I am now wise enough to
pronounce midsummer madness in another.
I made the narrator a bow; he smiled,
and continued his story.
Meanwhile, that I might not neglect
pleasures within my reach, while longing for
those as yet unattainable, I did not fail to
pursue the pastime of fishing, of which I was
then extremely enamoured. Moored in my
little skiff along the lonely shores of Grand
Island, listing the ripple of the current and
the thunder of the distant falls, I enjoyed a
sense of liberty, hooked my nibbling
whitefish
,
compared them to human beings, my
fellows, all as eager to nibble at the baits of
fortune, and thus played the moralist and
tyrant together.
One sunny evening, while thus engaged,
and with but little luck, the quiet of the hour
and the scene, added to the charms of my
philosophy, prevailed over me, and I fell fast
asleep in my boat; and so remained for half
an hour, dreaming, good, easy man, I was
hauling up whitefish with men's faces, and
other piscatory monsters, all in great
numbers
,
and with the ease and rapidity a
fisherman
loves.
On a sudden I awoke. The screams of
my victimsfor methought they opened their
VOL. II.3
mouths and cried for mercyhad disturbed
my conscience and started me out of my
slumber.
It was sunset: the shadows of the Canadian
hills were stealing over the river, and the
dusky twilight was gathering fast. For a few
moments, my thoughts were in the confusion
of slumber but half dispelled. The screams
of my visionary captives still sounded in my
ears; or, at least, I thought they did; until
gradually made aware that the cries I now
heard were those of human beings, whom I
saw running wildly along the Canada shore,
tossing their arms, and betraying other signs
of the greatest agitation. I felt a drowsy
surprise at the spectacle, and, for a moment,
half wondered what had become of the island
cove, with its hanging trees and jutting
rocks, in which I had moored my boat; and
what was the meaning of those dimmer and
more distant shores, that seemed gliding past
me like the phantasmas of a dream. Nay,
I even wondered what caused the
commotion
of the people on shoreat what they
were beckoning and screaming.
A louder yell from them broke the last
remaining
bonds of sleep; and I started up in
my skiff, restored for the first time to full
consciousness. My boat had broke her
moorings
,
and, God of Heaven! I was in the rapids!
Yes, in that fatal slumberfatal, yet
tranquil
as the sleep of happinessI had been
floating down the tide, hearing, in my dreams,
the shrieks of warning sent to me from the
shore, yet hearing them all in vain, until it
was too late to profit by them. I was in the
rapids, plunging down the watery declivity
towards the horrible gulf, from which nothing
but the wings of an eagle could save me. Oh,
the agony of that discoverythe sting of
that moment of horror!
But was there no escape? I was but a
hundred yards from the shore, and my oars
were swinging loose on their pivots. I seized
them with the energy of despair; but a fierce
blast burst from the shore, and whirled me still
further into the current. Away, awaydown,
downin spite of my exertions, which were
as the struggles of an insect in a tornado;
faster and faster, wilder and wildernothing
helped, nothing availed, save to add double
bitterness to my cup of misery. The rapids
grew fiercer and rougher, and, on a sudden,
the oars were shivered to pieces in my hands.
I started up with the mad thought of flinging
myself into the tide and swimming for my
life; but I was now midway in the channel,
and the fury of the galloping billows all
around me palsied heart and limb: there was
no hope, there was no escapethe falls had
secured their victim.
I sat down, and covered my eyes with my
hands; but it was only for an instant. I
could not thus die tamely, like a fettered brute.
I rose again, franticfiercely mad
determined
to leap into the water, and die at least
struggling. My boat was already among the
breakers on the reef running from the head
of the island. Look! you may see them
through the spruces: how they leap up,
striding
and curling over the hidden rocks, pillars
and arches of foam, beautiful yet dreadful to
behold!
Among these horrible billows my boat
darted like an arrow, struck a rock, and was
shivered to atoms. As for me, tossed twenty
feet into the air by the shock, I had just
enough of consciousness to exult in the thought
that death was snatching me from suffering.
In one moment more, I was swimming in the
torrent, grasping at rocks over which I was
borne with rending violence, and from which
I was torn before my fingers could clutch
them. A few months before, in constructing
the bridge to the island, a man had fallen into
the flood, and saved himself by clinging to a
rock. I had heard of the expedient by which
he was enabled to catch hold of the rock,
and now sought to imitate it. Instead of
striking out towards the island as I had been
endeavouring to do, though, miserable me!
with no hope of reaching it, I turned my face
up
the flood, and strained every nerve to
moderate the velocity of my flight through
the current. The expedient succeeded. My
body came in contact with a rock, which I
was able to grasp in my hands, and retain
hold of for a moment.
It was only for a moment: my body formed
an obstruction over which the waters leaped
and foamed as over a new rock; and away
they at last whirled me, drowning and
helpless
,
still struggling, but struggling, as I well
knew, wholly in vain.
Away, again, down the ridgy steep I went
swimming and rolling, now whelmed, now
upon the surface, stealing a ghastly look of
the sky that was to be dark to me for ever,
bruised, wounded, strangling, and stunned by
the thunder of the cataract over which I was
hastening to fall.
That thunder grew every instant louder
and more appalling; I could already see the
3*
hideous rim of the cataractthe sudden
sinking of the flood, known by its border of
foam, mingled with the yellow light
transmitted
through the edge of the down-curling
water. This I saw with what I deemed my last
look; but that look disclosed to me a black
cluster of rocks among, or very near to which
I was evidently hurrying. A prayer came to
my lips; I screamed it to Heaven; and with
efforts of strength that were rather
convulsions
than natural struggles, struck out
towards
them, hoping the torrent might dash
me among them. The torrent did dash me
among them; but it was not until the very
last of them had been reached that I found
myself able to grasp it, to maintain my hold,
and to crawl from the accursed flood. I was
saved! I lay secure upon the rockthat
very rock which I had so often longed to
visita prisoner in the midst, and upon the
verge, of the cataract.
CHAPTER III.
I LAY upon the rock exhausted and
fainting
,
and, for a time, almost inscnsible. But,
by and by, I recovered strength and looked
around me. How horrible was the prospect!
Night was closing around me; and there I
crouched upon my rockso small as scarce
to permit me to lie at lengthon one side of
it the abyss, on all the others the roaring
waters. My hair bristled, as I peeped down
the chasm; my heart withered, when I
looked
upon the expanse of torrent hemming me
in, the tumbling billows that menaced me as
they approached, and mocked me as they
rushed by and leaped down the precipice.
It was almost night, but objects were still
faintly discernible on the shore. I saw
human
figures moving on Table Rock. Were
they the men who had seen me in the rapids,
hailed me, waked me from my fatal sleep,
and followed after me, running along the
banks, tono, not to
help
me! Man could
not do thatbut to witness my fate? I rose
upon my feet, and shouted at the wildest
stretch of my voice. It was breath wasted
the twittering of a sparrow in a tempest,
the cry of a drowning mariner in the midst
of an ocean: the sound was scarcely audible
to myself. They heard me not; they saw
me not: the night was darkening upon them,
and they stole away from the falls. What
difference made it to me, whom, had they
seen me, they could have only pitied? Yet
I wept, when I saw them no more. There
was something of support, something of
comfort
,
even in the sight of a human being,
though afar off, and incapable of rendering
me any assistance.
By and by, it was wholly night; but a full
moon was stealing up the sky, throwing, first,
a yellow, ghastly lustre, and then, as she
mounted higher, a silver glory, over the
scene. A party of visiters came down upon
the Table Rock to view the falls by
moonlight
:
I could see the fluttering of white scarfs
and dressesthere were women among them
women, the soft-hearted, the humane, the
pitying. I rose again; I waved my arms; I
shouted. They look!It is upon the waters,
among which I amnothing, a straw, a mote,
a speck, invisible and unregarded. They
looked, and they departed; and I was again
in solitudeas lonely, as friendless, as
hopeless
,
as if the sole dweller of the sphere.
Presently, as the night lapsed on, clouds
gathered over the sky, and the moon was
occasionally hidden, now and then to dart
down a snowy beam through the driving
rack, giving a wild and spectral character to
the scene, which was before sufficiently
awful
.
There were even indications of a storm:
pale sheets of lightning ever and anon
whitened
along the sky, and perhaps the thunder
rolled; but that I heard notthe thunders of
the cataract swallowed up the detonations of
heaven. A breezethere was ever a breeze
there, the gusts from the vexed gulf below;
but this was a wind that prevailed over the
gusts of the fallcame down from the lake,
and grew momently in strength. I almost
expected the hour, when, growing into fury,
it should whirl me from my miserable rock,
and plunge me down the falls. My next
thought was full as terrible: this breeze
blowing
from the lakemust it not increase the
volume of waters flowing down the river?
Ay, and by and by, of all these rocks, now
breasting and repelling the flood, there will
not be one that is not covered a foot deep,
a mighty billow foaming over it! What
then becomes of me, denied secure possession
even of my wretched rock?
As I thought these things, deeming my
misery greater than I could bear, greater
than that wherewith heaven had afflicted any
other mortal, a shriek echoed in my ear; and
looking round, I beheld a boat in the rapids
not fifty yards off, and within but as many
feet of the fall, and in it a man, who seemed
like myself to have been asleep, and was but
now awaked to a consciousness of his
situation
.
He shrieked, started up, uttered one
more cry, and then vanished over the fall.
This dreary spectacle appeased my
clamours
;
it left me stupified, yet clinging with
convulsive grasp to the rock on which, I felt,
I had yet a brief term of existence.
The moon continued to rise, the clouds to
darken, the lightnings to grow brighter; and,
after a time, the storm I had apprehended,
burst over me; the artillery of heaven was,
at last, heard pealing and crashing, and
adding
its elemental music to the boom of the
waters. But before the storm burst, how
many new incidents were added to that
midnight
adventure! Other things of lifethings
to which life was as dear as to me, yet all
more wretched than Ipassed over the falls
within my sight. An eagle, blown by the
tempest from his perchor, perhaps, maimed
by a gunner, and thus precipitated into the
riverwas whirled over, almost within reach
of my hand, fluttering in vain the sinewy
wings that had once borne him among the
stars. Then came an ox, and a bear;a
horse, whose scream was to the heart as
sickening as death; and a dog, who, as he
passed, yelpedyes, even from the brink of
the fall, yelped to me for succour. To
me!
to me who was myself so helpless and lost!
I laughed a bitter laugh of derision and
despair.
By and by, a log was whirled down the
rapid, and among the rocks. It lodged
against the rock nearest my ownthat which
I would have given worlds but to reach
and the free end, swinging in the current,
struck against my little island, and ground
its way by. Was not this a bridge offered
me by Heaven, which had, at last, heard my
supplications? Frantic with excitement, with
mingled hope and fear, I snatched at the log,
to drag it athwart my rock, hoping the very
violence of the current would keep it
securely
lodged betwixt the two. I might as well
have attempted to arrest a thunderbolt in its
flight. I seized it, indeed, but its momentum
was irresistible; and with a tremendous jerk,
it both freed itself from my grasp and dashed
me from my rock over the fall. Yes, over
the fall; but! God be praised, my hands were
able to clutch upon the rock, from which I
hung suspended betwixt the heaven above
and the hell beneath, swinging in the gusts
and in the waters, which, on either side,
washed my feet, falling upon them as with
the weight of mountains.
What was all I had suffered before,
compared
with the agonies of that moment, thus
hanging, and every moment about to fall?
I endeavoured to plant my feet on the
broken
face of the rock, and, in this way,
clamber
again to its top: there were crannies and
ridges enough, but rotted by the water and
frosts, and they broke under my feet. My
efforts only served the purpose of digging
away the foundations of the rock, and thus
expediting the moment of my fall. I threw
all my strength into my arms, and, with a
prodigious effort, succeededyes, succeeded
in again placing myself upon the rock, where
I lay down upon my face and laughed with
joy.
Then came the tempest, the rushing wind,
the roaring thunder, the blinding lightning.
What horrible loveliness now sat upon the
scene! Was not this
more
than sublime?
more than terrific? Now the descending
waters were veiled in impenetrable darkness,
in a blackness as of death and chaos; and
anon the red bolt, the levin-rocket bursting
from the cloud, glared into the darkest nooks
of the abyss, revealing and adorning them
with a ghastly splendour. Add to this the
thunder rattling in rivalry with the roaring
flood; and you have Niagara, seen at
midnight
,
by the torches of Heavenfit lights
for a spectacle so grand and stupendous.
It was a spectacle too magnificent to be
lost by the visiters of Niagara, who came
trooping down to the Table Rock; where, at
every blaze of the lightning, I could see them
clustered, expressing by their gestures their
admiration and delight. I saw them so
distinctly
at times, that I thought it not
impossible
VOL. II.4
they also might see me; and accordingly
I rose again to my feet, forgetting, or
defying
,
the winds, and doing every thing in my
power to attract their attention.
I succeeded; some one at last beheld me:
I knew it by the agitation immediately
visible
among the crowd, all eyes being now
turned in one directionto the rock on which
I stoodI, the lost and the wretched! The
tears rushed to my eyes: I did not expect
them to help meI knew they could not; but
they pitied me; I should have, at least, some
sympathizing fellow creature to see me die.
The agitation increased; lights were
brought, and flashed to and fro; I saw torches
upon the path leading down to the ferry
torches even upon the water. What! they
were crossing the river? The people of my
own side would then know of my fate; and
theyyes,
they
might assist me! They could
reach Goat Islandthey could come out
upon the rocksthey could throw bridges
over those rocks that were otherwise
inaccessible
!
My heart leaped in my bosom: I
should yet be saved!
I looked to Goat Island; yet looked long in
vain. Was I deceived? Alas! that
agitation
,
those lights descending the rocks and
crossing the river; were there not a hundred
causes to explain them, without reference to
me? My hopes sunk, and I with them to
my rockHeaven and earth! the water was
already rising upon it! Yes, the river was
swelling, swelling fast, and my treacherous
rock was vanishing under my feet!
CHAPTER IV.
At
that moment, a light gleamed from Goat
Island, and I heardWas it fancy?a halloo.
Another light shone, followed by another, and
another; and the flash of lightning disclosed
a dozen men upon the bank. The same bright
glare exhibited me, also, to them, and they set
up a great shout that was no longer to be
mistaken for a noise made by the winds or
waters: it came distinctly to my ears; and I
saw my friends run down the bank towards
the rocks, waving their torches and their
hands, as if to bid me be of good cheer.
My transports were inexpressible, as I
beheld
them, some picking their way from rock
to rock, advancing as near to me as they
could, while others seemed to remain on the
island only to prepare the means for securing
a still nearer approach. They were
gathering
logs to make bridgesknotting ropes
together to float, or throw, to menay, I
knew not what they were doing; but I knew
they were doing every thing they could,
toiling
,
every man, with generous zeal; and all
of them, when the lightning discovered me
standing with outstretched hands, bursting
into shouts meant to encourage and animate
my spirits.
But the good work proceeded slowly; they
advanced but a little way on the rocks, when
the boiling currents brought them to a pause.
A log was brought, and one step further
secured
;
and then another pause. I saw, there
was doubt, and wavering, and confusion among
them, and cried aloud to them not to desert
me. Another log was brought and thrown
over the chasm that arrested them: it bent,
shook, and was half whelmed in the torrent,
and theyyes, it was plain to methey
feared
to tread it! One man, at last, a noble
creature, stirred by the piercing cries which
I now uttered, dreading lest they should give
over their exertions in despair, attempted the
passage of the logreached its middle,
staggered
and
then fell into the flood. A dismal
4*
shriek burst from his companionsBut he
was not lost! A rope had been previously
fastened around his body; and with this they
snatched him from the death he had so
intrepidly
dared for me.
This perilous adventure seemed to strike
them all with dread. The confusion and
wavering among them became still more
manifest
:
some crept back to the island; others
pointed to the river rolling down increased
and still growing floods; and others again
looked up to the clouds, which were blacker
and fiercer than ever. They uttered no more
shouts, they offered no longer encouraging
gestures. It was plain, they were
abandoning
me to my fate, or resolved to wait for
further assistance; when every moment of
delay
was to me full of danger. The floods
were already high upon my rock, and still
rising. Another hour, a half hourperhaps
but a few momentsand assistance must
come to me too late. They knew this; yet
they were leaving meyes, it was plain they
were leaving me!
I grew frantic at the thought; and,
ungrateful
for what they had already done, invoked
curses upon them for failing in what they
could not do.
Did my execrations reach their ears? As
they turned to depart, a single figure
detached
itself from the group, ran across the log
which had so nearly caused the death of the
former adventurer, and then, with such
tremendous
leaps as I never thought mortal man
could make, and with a courage that seemed
to laugh all perils to scorn, sprang from rock
to rock, and at last stood at my side!Will
you not fancy despair had driven me mad,
and that what I now saw and heard was the
dream of a mind overcome by sudden
insanity
?
I saw, thenno manbut an infernal
fiend standing at my side, who said to me,
`Be thou my servant, and I will set thee
upon dry land.' And as he spoke, I felt my
rock trembling and sinking under my feet.
What will not a man not do for life? `I
will be thy servant,' I cried. With that, he
laughed the laugh of a devil in my face, and
struck the rock with his foot; and down I
sank to perdition. He struck the rock with
his foot; or was it a thunder-bolt that smote
it, crushing it away like an arch of sand? It
melted from beneath me, and down I sank
down, down into the abyss; and the waters
fell upon me like a mountain, crushing,
drowning
,
suffocating; and Iand I The
narrator
paused a moment, wiped the
sweat-drops
from his forehead, and then laying his
hand upon a mossy bank beside him, continued,
I found myself lying on this identical bank,
a fragment of my boat beside me, the rest of it
emerging from the water below that log,
(pointing to the little bridge to the islet)
against which it had struck and been broken,
and hurrying off to the cataract at the rate
of sixty miles an hour!
I looked at the stranger in astonishment,
perhaps also with indignation; for his story
had taken deep hold on my feelings: but I
saw in him nothing to justify a suspicion that
he was amusing himself at my expense. On
the contrary, his appearance indicated deep
earnestness and deep emotion; and he was
manifestly struggling to shake off the effects
of a harrowing recollection. But the affair
was a mystery I desired to penetrate; and I
exclaimed, somewhat hastily, and, indeed,
with no little simplicity
And so, sir, I am to understand, you
were not upon that rock at all?
Certainly, he replied; I never was on
that rock in my life, and, please Heaven, I
never shall be. But, sirand here he
summoned
a faint smile, and again wiped his
browsyou do not, I believe, entirely
conceive
me. I tell you what was partly an
adventure
,
and partly a dream. It is true, that
I fell asleep in my boatthat my boat broke
her moorings and drifted into the rapids; and
it is also true, that, while thus drifting
towards
destruction, I
dreamed
all I have told
youthe cries from the shorethe toss from
the boat, and the swim to the rockthe
appearance
of the people upon Table Rock and
Goat Island, the demon and allthat I
dreamed
this, while thus floating. But in reality,
while I was thus pleasantly engaged, my
boat drifted into the channel here before us,
and struck that bridge-log with a violence
which both dispersed my dream and saved
my life, by hurling me ashore.
This is my whole story. You are
surprised
,
perhaps, that I made so much ado of
my dream, and so little of the real adventure.
But in truth, sir, I know nothing of the real
adventure, except that I fell asleep in my
boat and was thrown ashore on Goat Island
Remember, I was asleep all the time. The
dream is, to me, the real adventure, after all;
for it had, and still has, upon my mind, all the
force of reality. You observe, that I look
upon this foaming channel before usupon
that log, which if I had gone over or under,
I must have perished, with little or no
emotion
;
while, on the contrary, the sight of the
rock, the scene of imaginary perils and
sufferings
,
affects me in the strongest manner.
Truly, the dream, the dream's the thing, that,
with me, constitutes the soul of the
adventure
;
and I tell you it, not so much to
surprise
you with its singularity, as to add one
illustration to the many you have yourself,
perhaps, gathered, of the power of the
imagination
in striking into the heart impressions
deeper and more abiding than have been
imprinted
by the touch of reality. One may
understand the incurable hallucinations of
madness, who will remember the influence of
a dream.
I thanked the gentleman for his story and
explanation; and, after some hesitation,
begged
to know what construction he put upon
his compact with the juggling fiend.
Why, hang him, as he did not comply
with his engagement to place me on dry land,
(as was natural enough for a devil,) I
consider
the contract as broken, and my bond of
servitude cancelled, the stranger replied,
laughing; but added, a little more seriously
I lay the thing to heart, notwithstanding.
A man may be shown, even in a dream, the
true infirmity of his characterthe flimsiness
of his virtue, the weakness of his courage.
In the daylight, we are all actorsactors
even to ourselves: it is only in sleep we can
remove the mask, and look upon ourselves
as heaven made us.
But,
morbleu!
the tavern-bell rings. Let us
leave cold water and philosophy, and go to
dinner.

Caves
the world of rock-ribbed darkness
under our feethave always formed a
subject
on which my imagination delighted to
dwell; and to this day, the name seldom
falls upon my ears without conjuring up a
thousand grimly captivating associations
thoughts of the wild and supernatural, the
strange and terrificwhich are the more
enticing
for being so unlike the usual phantasms
of a day-dream existence. To my boyish
conceits, Epimenides gathering wisdom in a
brown study of fifty years in the cavern of
Crete, was a much wiser personage than the
other seven sages of Greece, who merely
hunted for truth at the bottom of a well; while
Bassus, the Carthaginian, digging, with a
Roman army, for the lost treasure-cave of
queen Dido,
[1]
[1]
V.
Tacit
., l. xvi, c. 1, et seq.This wonderful cavern,
which, according to the representations of Bassus, made to
the emperor Nero, was upon his own estate, near Carthage,
he declared, contained immense stores of gold not wrought
into the form of coin, but in rude and shapeless ingots, such
as were in use in the early ages of the world. In one part of the
cave were to be seen massy heaps, and in other places
columns of gold towering to a prodigious height; the whole
an immense treasure, reserved in obscurity to add to the
splendour
of Nero's reign.
The effect of this crackbrained schemer's representations
was not confined to the emperor, who despatched him to
Africa in state to fetch the buried treasure, but was felt by
the whole Roman people. No other subject, says Tacitus,
was talked of; and during the quinquennial games, it was
the theme on which the orators expatiated, and the poets
exhausted their invention. It was the Mississippi Scheme
of the day.
was a greater hero than the
mightiest Julius wading in blood at Pharsalia.
For the same reason, if the truth must be
told, I even held that the dark Hadesthe
inamabile regnum
, as Tisiphone so
emphatically
called itthe domain of Pluto, which,
as every body knows, was only to be reached
VOL. II.5
through the dismal antres of Cum and
Tnarus, was a decidedly more interesting
habitation for curious spirits than even the
sun-lit and privileged tops of Olympus. The
Troglodytes were my beau ideal of a
sensible
and happy nation.
Some tincture of my own peculiar
propensity
,
however, I think may be traced in
the mind of the world at large. It is certain,
there are few subjects on which men have
given, and still continue to give, a greater
loose to their imaginations than that of caves.
The time has indeed gone by when they
believed
that devils and condemned souls had
their appointed place within the hollows of
the earth, accessible, even to mortal foot,
through each cavern, each
alta spelunca
that
yawned on its surface; the Pythium no longer
breathes its oraculous vapour; the cave of
Trophonius
whispers no more the secrets of fate;
and even the modern hags of the broomstick,
that once
Plied in caves, th' unutterable trade,
and the fairy Gnomes that
Dug the mine and wrought the ore,
are no longer expected to be found quiring
around the infernal caldron, or dancing amid
their heaps of gleaming treasure. But if
Truththe murderess of Fancyhas been
at work on the classic mythos and the Gothic
fable, she has still left us enough to wonder
at in the world below; she has robbed it of
the supernatural, but not of the marvellous.
The
Mundus Subterraneus
of old father
Kircher
,
however exploded in most of its
particulars
,
among scientific men, contains nothing
too incredible for the mass of mankind.
Fortunately
,
as it happens, for the good old
Jesuit's sake, as well as mankind's, there are,
as far as mere caves are concerned, so many
wonders already established as undoubted
facts, that a man may be pardoned for
believing
almost any thing.But let us glance
at some of these authenticated marvels.
They will form a proper introduction to the
subject of the present descriptionthe
limestone
Pandemonium, with which I desire to
make the reader acquainted. A
propylon
of
wonders becomes the Mammoth Cave, and
should lead the way up to its gaping door, as
rows of sphinxes conduct the traveller to the
front of an Egyptian temple.
The famous Eldon Hole of Derbyshire
(who has not heard of the Eldon Hole?) has
been sounded with a plummet-line of nearly
ten thousand feet in lengththat is, within
but a little of
two miles
without reaching the
bottom; and the Pit of Fredericshall, in
Norway
,
it is inferred from the number of seconds
a stone consumes in reaching the bottom,
must be
more
than two miles in depth.
Whether the sound of a falling stone,
rever-berating
through a tube even smoother than
than we can fancy the pit of Fredericshall to
be, could be actually heard at the depth of
eleven thousand feet, I leave to be
conjectured
;
but I may aver, in reference to the
Eldon Hole, which was really sounded by a
line to the depth mentioned, that if the
doctrine
of internal fire, resuscitated by modern
Vulcanists, be true, and the scale of
increasing
temperatures adopted by them be just,
there ought to ascend from this same
convenient
flue, heat enough to warm all
Derbyshire
.
The internal heat of the earth is
said by philosophers to increase 1
Fahrenheit
,
for every 100 feet of descent. If the
mouth of Eldon Hole were on a level with
the general surface of the earth, the bottom
ought to be at a temperature 100 above the
mean temperature (say 50) at the surface.
Two miles under ground! With these facts
in view, who shall quarrel with his neighbour
for believing, as many a man does, that he
has eaten his dinner, in the Mammoth Cave,
under the bed of Green River? or with the
monkeys of Gibraltar for having made their
way from Africa to Europe, as every body
knows they must have done,
via
the Grot of
St. Michael, under the foundations of the
Mediterranean?
The
extent
of caves is a subject upon
which men are still more inclined to be
glorious
.
But here we have facts enough on
record to countenance any stretch of
magniloquence
;
besides
opinions
, which, as the
world goes, have, in general, with mankind,
all the weight and consequence of facts.
Thus, the people of Java are of opinion that
the sacred cave of Samarang affords a
submarine
passage from their island to Canton,
in Chinaa distance of somewhat more than
two thousand
miles, traced in a line as straight
as could be winged by an albatross. But
leaving opinions, let us refer to a fact of
philosophic
celebrity, which, besides being quite
a settler of all difficulties, possesses some
peculiar
features of interest. In the year 1752,
the Rio del Norte, one of the greatest rivers
5*
of America, (its length is reckoned at full
two thousand miles,) suddenly sank into the
earth, leaving its bed dry for a space of fifty
leagues; and in this condition it remained
several weeks, the waters flowing into some
subterranean abyss, which it required them
so long a time to fill. Allowing the river at
the Paso del Norte, where the incident
occurred
,
to be but a quarter-mile wide, and its
depth but five feet, with a current of two
miles the hour, and supposing it continued to
sink into the earth during two weeks, we can
give a pretty shrewd guess at the extent and
capacity of the cavern in which it was
swallowed
up. According to my calculations, to
dispose of such a body of water, would have
demanded a cave one hundred feet wide and
high, and just five hundred miles long! Nor
must this statement, however lightly made,
be considered absurd. Let it be remembered
that the channel of the river for a space of
fifty leagues, was absolutely robbed of its
waters. Supposing their disappearance had
been only momentary, it is easy to perceive,
the abyss that received them must have been
vaster than we can readily figure to our
imaginations
.
After this, no one need doubt the veracity
of those travellers who relate their moderate
rambles of twenty miles or thereabouts in
the great caves of the West. No one need
even be astounded at the grandeur of that
renowned cave of Tipperary, discovered in
1833, with its chamberswider than angels
kenone nearly a mile in circumference,
another of about three miles in
circumference
so
paddywhackishly described by an
enthusiastic correspondent of the Tipperary
Free Press; though, sorry we are to confess,
in the hands of a malicious surveyor, the hall
of a mile in circumference is said to have
suddenly shrunk into a room of ninety feet by
one hundred and fifty, and that of three miles
into one of one hundred feet by just two
hundred
and fifty. This is a climax somewhat
similar to that of the story of the seventy
cats
our
cat and another one! But what
if it be? There is
Something yet left remarkable
Beneath the visiting moon:
The wonders of the cave-world are not yet
exhausted.
Let us accompany Humboldt, the
profoundest
of chorographers, the most veracious
of travellers, to the cave of the Guacharo,
among the mountains of Cumana, in South
America. It opens on the face of a
precipice
,
a grand abyss seventy-seven feet high
and eighty-five wide. A river, born of
darkness
and night, like many of the streams of
Carniola, rolls from its mouth; while festoons
of creeping plants, the ivies of the tropics,
hanging from the rocks above, and glittering
with flowers of every gorgeous dye, swing
across the chasm like so many
boa-constrictors
on the watch for prey. A grove of
palms and ceibasthe tropical cotton-wood
rises tall and verdant at the very entrance,
with birds singing, and monkeys chattering,
among the boughs. Through this grove you
enter the cave; and in this grove you
continue
,
even when the world of sunshine has
been left some distance behind. The palms
still lift their majestic tops, and the ceibas
rub their green heads against the rocky roof;
whilst flowersthe heliconia, the
dragon-root
,
and othersbloom under your feet.
The palms and ceibas at last cease to appear;
but not so the flowers. As far as man has
penetrateda distance of more than a
quarter
of a mileyou still see them growing,
and all in darkness; on the hill of the cascade
(for a hill there is, and a cascade too,) and
beyond, you find them flourishing among
pillars of stalactite, as pale, as sequlchral, as
fantastic, yet as beautiful, as the growth of
spar around them. One might here dream
of the grove of Aladdin, with its trees
bearing
fruits of diamond and ruby, of sapphire
and emerald; and the more especially as
every rub of your iron lamp against a spar
calls up before your affrighted eyes a
thousand
horrible geniinot the mighty sons of
Eblis indeed, but black and dismal
guacharos
,
birds bigger than our northern screech-owls
that with fluttering wing and thrilling
shriek, repel the invader of their enchanted
abode. Compared with such a subterraneous
elysium, the garden discovered by Don
Quixotte, in his memorable exploration of the
cave of Montesinos,
el mas bello, ameno y
deleitoso que puede criar la naturaleza
the
most beautiful and delightful that nature ever
madeis but a kitchen garden.
But what is even the cave of the Guacharo
to the Flaming Caves of Cumanacoatwo
wonders of nature hidden among the same
mountains? In the face of a tremendous
precipice
looking over the savage woods that
skirt the mountain below, are two immense
holes, visible at a great distance, even in the
day-time. But it is at night that they are
seen to the best advantage; and then, if his
star be propitious, if the Indian Cyclopes in
the bowels of the Cerro start from their
slumbers
to renew their oft interrupted toil at
forge and bellows, the traveller, leaping from
his own uneasy couch, beholds with
amazement
the mouths of the caverns lighted up
with flames; he sees, high on the sable cliff,
two mighty disks of fire that glare upon him
from afar, like the eyes of some crouching
monstera tiger-cat as big as a
Cordillera
or those more portentous orbs that might
have blazed under the brows of the
archenemy
,
when he
Dilated stood
Like Teneriffe or Atlas,
the Quinbus Flestryn of demons. The
Indians
and Creoles that take to their heels at
the first shriek of the
guacharos
, could be
scarcely expected to brave the terrors of the
Flaming Caves. The thick forests at the
base of the cliffs are, besides, the haunts of
innumerable jaguarscreatures that think
little of shouldering a bullock in the midst of
the herd, and tramping victorious off, and
would, of course, think still less of
swallowing
a herdsman who should come in their
way. Hence, as it happens, mortal man has
not yet disturbed the solitude, or explored the
wonders of the Flaming Caves, which he is
content to admire at the distance that lends
safety, as well as enchantment, to the view.
Of an equally, perhaps of a still more,
wonderful character is another cave of South
Americain Peru or Bolivia, I thinkof
which I once read, though I cannot now tell
where to lay my hands on it, that gapes on
a mountain side, as black and gloomy as
cave may be, until the close of the day; when,
the shades of the mountain having fallen over
it, and over every thing else in the
neighbourhood
,
on a sudden, warm
sunshine
gushes
from its jaws, lights up the objects around,
smiles, trembles, fades, and then expires.
This must be the entrance to the Elysium of
the American racesthe Happy Hunting
Grounds, which all the tribes, savage and
civilized together, believe the Master of Life
has prepared for the souls of the brave and
just. But, unfortunately, no Humboldt has
yet visited the spot, and we know no more of
it than I have mentioned. Within its
unknown
chambers we should perhaps find such
Hesperian Gardens and Elysian Fields as
must leave even the cave of the Guacharo in
the shadecrystal wildernesses, overgrown
with phosphorescent
cryptogami
those
luminous
plants, which, in the coal-mines of
Dresden, and some other places, hanging in
festoons from the roof and pillars, and
stretching
in tapestry along the walls, diffuse a
glorious lustre on all around; until the visiter,
amazed and delighted, fancies himself in the
palace of the Fairy Queen, or a cavern dug
out of moonlight. The South American cave,
to whatever cause it may owe its resplendent
emanation, is, undoubtedly, a great wonder;
but the rocks of the Nile and the Orinoco
exhale
music
why should not others breathe
sunshine?
According to old Mezeray (or rather,
according
to some of those philosophers who
quote him, for I myself could never light upon
the page that records the marvel,) there is a
cavern in Dauphiny, near Grenoble, famous
as the seat of a subterraneous Erie and
Niagara
,
famous also for the exploring voyage
performed in it, in his youth, by Francis I, in
royal person. At a considerable distance
from the entrance was a sheet of water of
unknown bounds, which had previously
arrested
the steps of all visitants. But what
shall restrain the curiosity of a king? A
barge was constructed, illuminated with
hundreds
of flambeaux, and launched into the
flood; into which the gallant Francis,
attended
by a party of his bravest courtiers, struck
boldly out, the Columbus of the caverned deep
taking good care, however, to leave a huge
beacon-fire blazing behind him on the rocky
beach, to secure his safe return. A voyage
of three miles (
cave-distance
, be it recollected,)
conducted the royal adventurer to the
opposite
shores of the ocean; whence having
landed, and, I suppose, taken possession in
the usual style of discoverers, he turned his
prow in another direction, determined to
fathom all the mysteries of the lake. By and
by, an experienced boatman declared the
barge was no longer floating on a stagnant
lake, but in a current that was perceptibly
increasing in strength; and a courtier called
the attention of the monarch to a hollow
noise heard in the distance, which, like the
current, was every moment growing stronger
nay, even swelling into horrific thunder.
The navigators rested on their oars, while a
plank, to which several flaming torches were
VOL. II.6
tied, was committed to the water. It floated
rapidly away, became agitated, tossed up
and down, and finally pitched down the
unknown
cataract, to which the rival of Charles
V. was so ignorantly hastening. Back
oars! was then the cry; and all rowing for
their lives, the monarch had the good fortune
to regain his beacon, and the upper air, with
which, it appears, he remained content for
the rest of his life.
A singular story was formerly told of a
cave in Upper Canada, in the ridge that
bounds the western shore of Ontario, from
which it was but seven or eight miles
removed
.
It bore the awe-inspiring title of the
Devil's Wigwam
Manito Wigwam
so
called
by the Indians, who seemed very devoutly
to believe that the father of lies had there
established
his head-quarters. (Had they put
him in the Irish cave, previously described,
the residence would have been more
appropriate
.)
The Manito-Wigwam was reported
to be of vast depth, consisting of several
terraces
separated one from another by
precipices
of more than a hundred feet
perpendicular
pitch, the last terminating in a fathomless
gulf, into which no human being had ever
endeavoured to penetrate. From this cavern,
once a week, issued a terrific din, an
earthquake-like
explosion, of such force as to
shake the hills for five leagues around. The
Manito-Wigwam was therefore a very
wonderful
cave. I say
was
, for I know not
whether it is now in existence. The same
enterprizing spirit which has converted
Niagara
into a mill-pond, might as easily have
modified the Devil's Wigwam into a hole for
storing winter potatoes.
To this catalogue of wonderful caverns,
which I might easily swell to greater length,
it would be unpardonable not to add a notice
of the marvellous one discovered a year or
two since by two scientific gentlemen of
Philadelphia, in one of the mountain counties
of East Tennessee; in which they lighted
upon the petrified bodies of two men and a
dog, of races manifestly older by many
thousand
years than the men and dogs of the
present day. Those venerable remains it
was said to be the intention of the
discoverers
to remove from their rocky dwelling to
the more appropriate shelves of a museum, to
take their places among mummied moderns
of the time of Pharaoh, and divide with
Javanese
dragons and mermaids the admiration
of a discerning public. It does not,
however
,
appear that these petrified ancients
have yet left their cavern, not so much as a
finger having been received in any museum
in the land; a circumstance that can only be
accounted for by the ingenious and veracious
editor, to whom the public owes the first
notice
of the discovery.
CHAPTER II.
THE MAMMOTH CAVE: ITS EXTENTCAVES OF
KENTUCKY
THE
BARRENSBULL, THE DOG
CAVE-HOLLOW
MOUTH
OF THE MAMMOTH CAVE.
Among
so many wonders and prodigies,
the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky, it may be
supposed, must sink into insignificance. It
reveals no subterranean gardens, no Stygian
lakes, no stupendous waterfalls; it discharges
no volcanic flames, it emits no phosphoric
sunlight; it contains no petrified pre-Adamites,
and no hollow thunders are heard resounding
among its dreary halls. It is not two miles
deep; it is not five hundred miles longnay,
it can no longer boast even the twenty miles
of extent, which formerly contributed so much
to its glory. The surveyor has been among
its vaults; he has stretched his chain along
its galleries, he has broken the heart of its
mystery, and, with cruel scale and protractor,
6*
he has laid it down upon paper. He has
illustrated
the truly remarkable fact, which none
but the most cold-blooded of philosophers
were ever before inclined to suspectnamely,
that when you would know the true extent
of any antre vast in which you have
journeyed
,
the admiring of all admirers, you
should first take the shortest extent you can
possibly believe it to be, and then divide
that length by the sum total of your
thumbs and fingers, being satisfied that,
if the answer be not exactly right, it will be
extremely near it. Thus Weyer's cave in
Virginiathe Antiparos of the Ancient
Dominion
,
one of the loveliest grots that fairy
ever, or never, danced inwas, until recently
surveyed, pretty universally considered as
being full three miles in length. By the rule
above, we should bring its true extent down
to between five and six hundred yards; a
result
that very closely coincides with the
admeasurement
of the surveyor. By the same
rule, we should reduce the Mammoth Cave to
two miles; which comes but little short of the
truth. Nevertheless, the Mammoth Cave is
still the monarch of caves: none that have
ever been measured can at all compare with
it, even in extent; in grandeur, in wild,
solemn, severe, unadorned majesty, it stands
entirely alone. It has no brother, it is like
no brother.
What I have said of the length of this
cave, it must be observed, applies only to a
single passage. It is a labyrinth of branches,
of which the principal one is two miles and
a half long. There are two or three others
of nearly half that length. The extent of
all the passages, taken together, is between
eight and nine miles. There are, besides,
many which have never been explored, and
perhaps never will besome opening in the
sides, and at the bottoms, of pits that would
appal a samphire-gatherer or an Orkney
fowler
;
others, of which there are countless
numbers, opening by orifices so narrow that
nothing but blasting with gunpowder can
ever render them practicable; and perhaps as
many more, accessible and convenient enough,
but whose entrances, concealed among rocks
and cranmies, no lucky accident has yet
discovered
.
The Deserted Chambers, forming
a considerable portion of the whole cave, and
now accessible through two different
approaches
,
have only been known for a
comparatively
brief number of years; and the
Solitary Cave, with its groves of spar, its
pools, and springs, and hollow-sounding floors,
is a still more recent discovery.
The survey of the cave, as far as it is now
known, we owe to Mr. Edmund F. Lee, an
engineer of Cincinnati, who has executed his
task with skill and fidelity. The difficulties,
laboursI might even say, the dangersof
his enterprise (in which he was occupied, I
believe, three or four monthsthe whole
winter
of 1834-5,) can only be appreciated by
those who are familiarly acquainted with the
cave. The exploit of surveying and levelling
eight or nine miles of cavern appears to me
unprecedented. Mr. Lee's Map, with the
libretto
of Notes accompanying it, published
in Cincinnati by James and Gazlay,
interesting
alike to the lovers of romance and of
science, is a curious and valuable production,
which I cordially recommend to my readers
and the public.
The Mammoth Cave lies upon Green
River, in a corner of Edmonson county,
Kentucky
,
in the heart of the district long known
as the Barrensa vast extent of rolling hills
and knobs, once bare and nakedprairies, in
fact, as they were sometimes calledbut now
overshadowed by a young forest of
black-jacks
and other trees that delight in an arid
soil. The whole country is one bed of
limestone
,
with as many caverns below as there
are hills above, both seeming to have been
formed at the same moment, and by the same
causesome primeval convulsion by which
the rocky substratum was torn to pieces, and
the knobs heaped up. That earthquakes had
something to do in carving out the caves of
the West, no one will doubt who has
clambered
among those prodigious blocks of stone
masses which to move would have puzzled a
Pelasgian builder of oldthat lie strewn about
the floors of the Mammoth Cave, shivered from
the roofs and walls by some violent concussion.
The earthquakes that formed them, seem
however, not always to have opened the
ragged
fissures to the air: that was left to
another
agencythe infiltration, in most
instances
,
of water, by which the thinner and
weaker portions of the crust were
gradually
disintegrated, and finally swept into
the interior. The Mammoth Cave itself
was evidently opened in this way, in
remote
times, after remaining sealed up for
a long series of centuries; and in this case,
as in most others, the mass of falling rocks,
sinking across a spacious excavation, has
been sufficient to block it up in one direction,
while yielding easy access in the other. The
Horse-shoe Cave, however, a grotto twelve
or fifteen miles distant from the Mammoth
is an instance in which the roof has fallen,
without obstructing the passage on either
side: you enter the cave, as it were, by a side
door, and may penetrate with equal ease to
the right hand or the left. In many cases,
there seem to exist caverns with no roof of
rock at all, the fissure having extended to the
top of the limestone, where it is covered over
only by a thin layer of soil. It is not
altogether
an uncommon thing for a traveller in
Kentucky to play the Curtius, and plunge,
horse and man, into the bowels of the earth
at a moment when he feels neither patriotic
nor heroical, but very much like any other
mortal. It was but two years ago that a
gentleman of Lexington, ambling over his
fields, in the neighbourhood of that city,
surveying
his stacks of hemp, and speculating
perhaps, like a philanthropist, upon the
number
of rascals his crop might be expected to
hang, suddenly found himself sinking into the
earth, whirling in a Maelstrom of clay and
stones; from which, however, he succeeded
in extricating himself by leaping briskly from
his horse. The animal sank to a depth of
one hundred and fifty feet, where he became
wedged between two rocks, the sides of a
cavern, and perished. A similar accident
happened in the Barrens of which I speak, as
early as 1795, when a planter of West
Tennessee
lost his horse, and saved himself, in
the same way; only, that on this occasion,
the animal tumbled into a more spacious
cavern, in which he walked about until
starved
to death.
But let us hasten to the cave. It is
midsummer
.
It was at that season, several
years ago, I made my first (it was not my
only) visit to the cave. It was the close of
merry Junemerry, yet not merry, for the
pestilence was then abroad in the land, and
men were thinking and talking of nothing
but cholerawhen I, with an excellent friend,
(alas! now no more,) who was as eager as
myself to escape to some nook where cholera
was unknown, where our ears should be no
longer pained, nor our souls sickened by
every day's report of casesmade my way
to the heart of the Barrens, and in good time,
one bright morning, found myself
approaching
the Mammoth Cave. The air was hot
upon the hill-tops, hotter still in the little
valleys
that, with their lowly cabins of logs, and
smiling, though half-cultivated corn-fields,
presented
here and there a few demi-oases in
the desert of black-jacks, through which we
were jogging: there was no breeze in the
forest
,
but there was note of preparation among
the white and sable-silvered clouds aloft, that
now sent a heavy rain-drop pashing in our
faces and now woke the woods with rattling
peals of thunder. But what cared we for
shower
or bolt? We were vagabondizing among
the knobs; and, by and by, we should be
under the canopy of the cave, deep in vaults
where the rain beats not and the
thunder
is never heard. We are even now riding
over its labyrinthine halls: each of these rocky
hills is arched over one of its gloomy vaults;
and it is in a glen upon the side of the very
knob, on whose flat, plain-like summit we are
now coursing to our journey's end, we are to
find its darksome portals. Under this
mouldering
stile of logs, where we leave our
Rozinantes
,
rejoiced to escape their excruciating
backs, under this venerable, rickety porch,
where we pause a moment to look around, at
a depth of a hundred feet below, is one of
the hugest chambers of the cave. The guide
prepares his iron torches, his bucket of oil
or, to speak less poetically, his bucket of lard,
(for here the fat of Leviathan is unknown,)
and his basket of provisions; while we,
exhorting
him to despatch, set off to explore
the mysteries of the glen, the redoubtable
Cave-Hollow, ourselves.
But first let us seduce honest Bull, the
great dog that has been wagging his tail at
us in token of friendship, to lead us to the
cavern. You may get him into the Hollow,
quoth the guide, nodding his head; but you
won't get him into the cave; because dogs
are exactly the people that won't go in, no
way you can fix it.They have a horror of
it.Verily, after we had ourselves got in, and
seen the last glimmer of fading daylight
swallowed
up in midnight gloom, we began to
think Bull's discretion not so very
extraordinary
.
There actually
is
a point at which
dogs begin to think of themselves in
preference
to their masters. I once saw a hulking
cur, who boasted the same name Bullas all
big dogs, except Newfoundland ones, do
attempt
to follow his master over the bridge
above the falls of Niagara. It was a fine
sunshiny day, and Bull, being in a joyous
humour
,
had gallopped a hundred yards or so
along the bridge, without much thinking of
where he was or whither going. But on a
VOL. II.7
sudden the idea struck his mind, or whatever
part of him served for mind; he stopped,
applied
his nose to a crack in the planks, and
made a dead set at the horrible green and
white billows beneath. Come on, Bull!
cried his master from afar. If I do, said
Bull, I wish I may ; not that he
actually
said so much in words, but it was written
in his eye. His tail fell, his ears began to
to rise, he stole a sidelong look at the waters
above and the waters below; and planted
himself
in the centre of the bridge, from which
he refused to budge, except upon hard
jostling
,
even to let myself get by. His master
called again and again; and I believe Bull
made some small effort to advance, stepping
slowly and carefully forward, as if treading
upon eggs. He did not, however, proceed
far; and when I saw him last, he had come
to a second stand, and was again surveying
the boiling surges through the gaps of the
planks, looking volumes of mute terror and
perplexity. How he ever got to firm land
again I know not; for he was evidently as
much afraid to return as to advance.
Were there indeed such horrors in the
Mammoth Cave as should make a dog a
coward on instinct? The thought sharpened
our expectations, and we were the more
eager to make its acquaintance.
And now let us descend the Cave-Hollow
a ravine that begins a mere gully at first,
but, widening and deepening as you proceed,
becomes at last, on the banks of the river,
half a mile to the west, a valley that might
almost be called spacious. It is bounded by
ledges of calcareous rock overlaid by
sandstone
,
which, in some places, assume the
appearance
of precipices, and, in others, are
piled together in loose blocks. Along the
line of wall thus bounding the valley, spring
tall oak-trees and chestnuts, rooted among
the rocks; while elms, and walnuts, maples
and papaws, and a thousand other trees, with
vines, weeds, brambles, and many a glaring
wild-flower, occupy the depths of the hollow,
shutting it out almost as much from the blue
heaven above as its rocky walls seclude it
from the habitable earth around. A brook
that runs when the clouds run, and at no
other period, has ploughed a rugged channel
down one side of the glen; and along its
banks or in its parched bed, as seems most
convenient, we make our way, looking for the
cave, which refuses to be found; hiding from
the sun, which, however, neither the scudding
thunder-clouds nor the embowering tree-tops
can wholly keep from our visages; and
sighing
for something to allay the burning
quality of the atmosphere, some cool breeze
stirred by the wing of Favonius from
fountain-side
or brim, someBut soft! we have
our wish; a cool breeze does at last breathe
over our cheeks; it rolls a gentle and
invisible
stream, a river of air, down the valley.
On that grassy terrace above, we shall
enjoy
it. On that grassy terrace we step, and
the cave yawns before us!The breeze, at
first so cool, and now so icy, comes from its
marble jaws; it is the breath of the monster.
How dark, how dismal, how dreary! The
platform sinks abruptly under your feet,
forming
a steep and broken declivity of thirty or
more feet in descent, and as much in width.
From the bottom of the abyss thus formed,
springs an arch, whose top is on a level lower
even than your feet, while the massive rock
that crowns it is on a plane which you can
still overlook. The cave is therefore under
your feet, you look down upon it; it is
subterraneous
even at its entrance; and this is a
circumstance which adds double solemnity
and horror to its appearance. In other
respects
its aspect is haggard and ghastly in
the extreme. The gray rocks, consisting of
thick horizontal plates, forming ledges and
galleries along the sides; the long grasses,
the nodding ferns, the green mosses and
lichens
,
that have fastened among their
crannies
;
the pit immediately under the spring of
the arch, loosely choked with beams, planks,
earth and stones; the stream of crystal water,
oozing from the mosses on the face of the
crowning rock, and falling with a wild
pattering
sound upon the ruins below; the dismal
blackness of the vacuity, in which objects are
obscurely traced only for a few fathoms; and
the ever-breathing blast, so cold, so strange,
so sepulchre-like; form together a picture of
desolation and gloom inconceivably awful
and repelling. Indeed, instances not
unfrequently
occur where visiters are so much
overcome by its appearance, as to fall back
upon their instincts, like honest Bull the dog,
and refuse to enter it altogether. A singular
addition is given to its dreariness by the
presence
of several mouldering beams of wood
stretched across the mouth from ledge to
ledge, and two tottering chimneys of stone,
behind the cotton-wood tree on the right
hand; the ruins of old saltpetre works, the
manufacture of which villanous compound, in
7*
the last war, was carried on to a great
extent
in the cave. But peace came, and with
it those curses of trade, low prices, by which
the manufacturers were scattered to the
winds, and the Mammoth Cave again left to
its solitude. But that is its proper condition.
A city at Niagara, a factory in the Mammoth
Cave, are consummations of enterprising
ambition
only to be hoped for by men whose
hearts are of gold and silver, and their nerves
and brains of the dross thereof.
How dark, how dismal, how dreary! One
would think that no living creature, save man
alone, the lover of romance and adventure,
would willingly enter this horrible pit. Yet
a swallow has built her nest under the grim
arch; and as she darts with flashing wing
through the thin waters of the falling brook,
and turns gamesomely about, and darts
through them again and again, her twittering
cries are as full of jocund mirth as of music.
What is it to her that all around is darkness,
fear, and desolation? The chirping of her
young from the shattered roof makes the
cave her paradise. And that little lizard,
striped
with azure and scarlet,that dances around
the trunk of the stunted crab-apple growing on
the face of the descentthe most beautiful,
delicate, graceful, resplendent, mischievous
little rascal my eyes ever beheldhe mocks
me, but he will not let me catch him!there
is something here, though what I know not,
to make the chill, moist entrance of the cave
more delighiful even to
him
than the gray,
heated rocks above, where his comrades are
basking. And yet the lizard and swallow are
frisking at the mouth of a sepulchre. The
nitre taken from this cave was dug from
among the bones of buried Indians. If we
can believe the account of those who should
know best, many a generation of dead men
sleeps among the vaults of the Mammoth
Cave. Perhaps this thought, busy in the
mind of the visiter, invests its aspect with a
more awful solemnity than it really
possesses
.
CHAPTER III.
DESCENT INTO THE CAVETHE NARROWSTHE
BLAST OF CAVESTHUNDERSTORMTHE
VESTIBULE
.
But
let us descend. The guide has arrived;
the swinging torches are tied each to its
staff, and lighted; our canteens are filled from
the trough that receives the crystal brook,
and all is ready for the subterranean journey.
Enter the mighty portal
Arch'd so high, that giants may jet through
And keep their impious turbands on, without
Good-morrow to
the gloom. How ragged and shivered is the
broken roof above, as if those aforesaid giants
with the turbands on had been employed
to rough-hew the arch. But the floor is firm,
dry, smooth clay: so far we owe thanks to
the nitre-diggers, who have constructed a
pathit almost might be called a
carriage-road
half
a mile into the cave.
Over this path, ringing with sonorous clang
to every footstep, facing full to the eastyet
what an east! an Orient that never knew a
dawnthe thunder roaring behind us, (for
the storm has at last burst,) and the gust of
the cave murmuring hollow in front, we
trudge along; until, sixty paces from the
dripping-spring
,
we find ourselves at the
Narrows
,
where the roof is but seven or eight
feet high, and the width of the cave not
much greater. The passage has been still
further contracted by a wall built up by the
miners, leaving only a narrow door-way, that
was formerly provided with a leaf to exclude
the cold air of winter. Here, if the nervous
visiter has not been appalled at the entrance,
he will perhaps be dismayed by the furious
blast rushing like a winter tempest through
the door. Its strength is indeed astonishing.
It deprives him of breath, and, what is worse,
of light; the torches are blown out; they are
relighted and again extinguished: we must
grope our way through in the dark, and trust
to flint and steel. It is done: once through
the narrow door, and the wind appals no
longer. All is calm and still, a few feet
within
the wall; it is only at the contracted gap
that we feel the fury of the current. In the
winter, or at any other period of cold weather,
the blast is reversed; the current is then
inwards
.
There are numerous caves in America, as
well as in other parts of the world, which
exhibit the phenomena of the
blast;
and this
has usually been reckoned one of their chief
wonders. It has given rise among
philosophers
to a deal of fanciful theory, which,
perhaps, would never have been indulged in,
had not observers in the first place mystified
the whole subject by recording facts that only
existed in their imagination. Thus, some
caves are said to blow in and out, without
much regard to the state of the weather, a
wonder
which was only to be explained by
supposing
the existence of intermitting fountains
that is, of vast pools alternately rising and
falling
,
and so, by increasing or diminishing the
space within, expelling or inhaling the air;
while others again were reported to blow out
perpetuallyas in the case of the cave at the
Panther Gap in Virginia, described by Mr.
Jefferson. This cave Mr. Jefferson, I
think, could never have seen, as he describes
it (in very loose terms, it must be confessed)
as having an entrance of about one
hundred
feet
diameter;
whereas all travellers
represent the outlet as being quite small.
Allowing that he describes it on mere
hear-say
,
we need attach no great weight to his
assertion, that the current is strongest in dry,
frosty
weather, and weakest in long spells of
rain. That it does blow in the summer is
well ascertained; that it blows at all in
winter
,
I feel strongly disposed to doubt,
having
heard that part of the story contradicted
by a person residing in the neighbourhood of
the Gap. Our opinion is, that
all
caves of
any magnitude blow; that the blast becomes
perceptible only when the outlet is very small;
that it is in all caves alikethe blast being
outward in hot, and inward in cold weather;
and that to understand the mystery, nothing
more is required than to place a candle in a
door communicating betwixt a very warm
and a very cold room, holding it first near
the floor, when a cold current will be found
rushing
into
the warm room, and then near
the lintel, where a warm current will be
found rushing
out
. In other words, we think
that there is a double current flowing,
Mediterranean-wise
,
at the mouth of every cave,
and flowing always, except when the
temperatures
within and without are the same;
a cold current at the bottom rushing out in
summer, and
in
during the winter, and a warm
one above flowing in the contrary direction,
a perpetual circulation of air being thus kept
up. This is an idea, which, being too
simple
and natural to be readily conceived, did
not occur to us when it was in our power to
verify or disprove it at the Mammoth Cave,
as we had many opportunities to do. Our
mind, in fact, on all such occasions, was
engaged
with a sublimer idea. We thought of
musical stringsa great olian lyre
stretched across the door, and waked to
majestic
music by the breath of the cavesuch
solemn strains as were poured by the
ingenious
instrument of Belarius over the
dying
Imogen.
Bur we have passed the windy gap, and
are in the cave, where all is silence and
tranquillity
.
The thunder is still raving in the
upper air, but its peals already come faintly
to the ear: a few more steps and they will be
inaudible. With a rock a hundred feet thick
over our heads, we can defy their fury, and
forget it. Armies of a hundred thousand
men might fight a Waterloo on the hills
above, and we know nothing of it. At least,
we should hear neither drum nor trumpet,
nor sound of artillery; though cascades of
blood, falling where we are to find only
cascades
of water, might impart the hideous
secret
.
Our torches are relighted, making
each
A little glooming light, much like a shade,
which we take care to direct to the sounding
floor, to watch our footing, satisfied, after
one or two eager efforts to penetrate the
gloom that has now invested us, that nothing
is to be seen until we have got out
cave eyes
.
We catch, to be sure, a dim glance, now and
then, of a low roof almost touching our heads,
of two rugged walls that are ever and anon
rude to our elbows; one of themthat is,
one of the wallsthe workmanship of Nature
herself, though of Nature in no pains-taking
mood, the other piled up on the left hand by
the nitre-diggers of old, who were thus wont
to dispose of the loose rocks that came in
their way. You are sensible you are
thridding
a path as narrow as the road of
Honour
,
VOL. II.8
A strait so narrow,
Where one but goes abreast;
and you begin to have your doubts whether
the Mammoth Cave is, after all, all it has been
represented to be. You get tired even of
admiring the musical ringings of the guide's
footsteps on the hard earthen floor; you are
sure you have trudged a quarter of a mile
already, (the guide assures you, half a mile,)
along this dismal, low, narrow, stupid
passage
;
you become impatient; you demand if
there is nothing better to be seen; and the
guide, answering by bidding you look to your
footingwhich, however, you are doing of
your own accord, the path having suddenly
become brokenat last directs you to pause,
and look around.What now do you see?
What now do we see? Midnightthe
blackness of darknessnothing! Where are
we? where is the wall we were lately
elbowing
out of the way? It has vanished, it is
lost; we are walled in by darkness, and
darkness
canopies us above. Look again; swing
your torches aloft! Ay, now you can see it,
far up, a hundred feet above your head, a gray
ceiling rolling dimly away like a cloud; and
heavy buttresses, bending under the weight,
curling and toppling over their base, begin to
project their enormous masses from the
shadowy
wall. How vast, how solemn, how
awful! And how silent, how dreadfully
silent
!
The little bells of the brain are ringing
in your ears; you hear nothing clse, not even
a sigh of air, not even the echo of a drop of
water falling from the roof. The guide
triumphs
in your looks of amazement and awe,
he takes advantage of your feelings all so
solemn and romantic:Them that says the
Mammoth ain't a rale tear-cat don't know
nothing about it!
With which truly philosophic interjection,
he falls to work on certain old wooden ruins,
to you yet invisible, and builds a brace or
two of fires; by the aid of which you begin
to have a better conception of the scene
around you. You are in the Vestibule, or
ante-chamber, to which the spacious entrance
of the cave and the narrow passage that
succeeds it, should be considered the mere
gateway and covered approach. It is a
basilica
of an oval figure, two hundred feet in
length by one hundred and fifty wide, with a
roof, which is as flat and level as if finished
by the trowel of the plasterer, of fifty or
sixty
,
or even more, feet in height. Two
passages
,
each a hundred feet in width, open
into it at its opposite extremities, but in right
angles to each other; and as they preserve a
straight course for five or six hundred feet,
with the same flat roof common to each, the
appearance to the eye is that of a vast hall
in shape of the letter L, expanded at the
angle, both branches being five hundred feet
long by a hundred wide. The passage on
the right hand is the Great Bat Room; that
in front, the beginning of the Grand Gallery,
or the main cavern itself. The whole of this
prodigious space is covered by a single rock,
in which the eye can detect no break or
interruption
,
save at its borders, where is a
broad sweeping cornice, traced in horizontal
panel-work, exceedingly noble and regular;
and not a single pier or pillar of any kind
contributes to support it. It needs no
support
;
it is like the arched and ponderous
roof of the poet's mausoleum,
By its own weight made steadfast and immoveable.
The floor is very irregularly broken,
consisting
of vast heaps of the nitrous earth, and of
the ruins of the hoppers, or vats, composed
of heavy planking, in which the miners were
accustomed to leach it. This hall was, in
fact, one of their chief factory rooms. Before
their day, it was a cemetery; and here they
disinterred many a mouldering skeleton,
belonging
,
it seems, to that gigantic eight or
nine feet race of men of past days, whose
jaw-bones so many thousand veracious
persons
have clapped over their own, like
horse-collars
,
without laying by a single one to
convince the soul of scepticism.
Such is the Vestibule of the Mammoth
Cavea hall which hundreds of visitors have
passed through without being conscious of
its existence. The path leading into the
Grand Gallery hugs the wall on the left hand,
and is, besides, in a hollow, flanked on the
right hand by lofty mounds of earth, which
the visiter, if he looks at them at all, as he
will scarcely do at so early a period after
entering, will readily suppose to be the
opposite
walls. Those who enter the Bat Rooms
into which flying visiters are seldom
conducted
will
indeed have some faint suspicion,
for a moment, that they are passing through
infinite space; but the walls of the cave being
so dark as not to reflect one single ray of
light from the dim torches, and a greater
number of them being necessary to disperse
the gloom than are usually employed, they
8*
will still remain in ignorance of the grandeur
around them. In an attempt which we made
to secure a drawing of the Vestibule, we had
it lighted up with a dozen or more torches
and flambeaux, and two or three bonfires
beside
;
but still the obscurity was so great that
it was necessary, in sketching any one part,
to have the torches for the time held before
it. It was, in fact, impossible to light it up
so as to embrace all its striking features in
one view. We saw enough of it, however,
to determine its quality. It possesses not
one particle of beauty; but its grandeur, its
air of desolation combined with majesty, are
unspeakably impressive.
CHAPTER IV.
THE BAT ROOMSTHE CREVICE PITTRAGEDY OF
THE PIT CAVE.
But
let us enter the Bat Roomsthe Big
Bat room and the Little onethe latter
being
a narrow branch of the former,
remarkable
only for its two pits, one of which, the
Crevice Pit, is the deepest that has been
measured in the whole cave.
The Big Bat Room is about one third of a
mile long, counting from its entrance, which
is not half a mile as is generally supposed,
but just three hundred yards from the mouth
of the cave. It is interesting only from its
width and height, which it preserves nearly
to the end unimpaired. It terminates in
mounds of massive sandstone, that, with the
assistance of water ever dripping through
them, have crushed in the roof, leaving a
shadowy dome above them. The Little Bat
Room opens in its left wall, six or seven
hundred
feet from the Vestibule. It is long,
winding, low, and deep; and was once the
bed of a torrent that has worn its walls into
a thousand figures, with numerous winding
holes which lead perhaps into other caverns,
but are too small to be entered. It is now
dry, like other parts of the cave, and
blackened
by age, or by the smoke of the torches
of the ancient inhabitants of the cave and the
miners. Within but a few feet of its
extremity
,
there are two low-browed niches, one
in each wall, nearly opposite each other, the
blackest, ugliest looking places in the whole
world, particularly that on the left hand,
which is a hundred times blacker and uglier
than the other. One feels an instinctive
horror
of this place at the very first look, and
perceives a crab-like inclination in his legs
to sidle away from it, if not to beat a retreat
altogether. There never was better occasion
for instinct. Under that niche, down to
which the rocky floor you stand on so
treacherously
inclines, is a pit three hundred feet
deepay, by'r lady! and perhaps three times
three hundred more to the back of them, if
not three times three thousandwho can
tell? Mr. Lee struck bottom at two hundred
and eighty feet; but, as in the case of the
Bottomless Pit, to be spoken of hereafter, a
stone thrown down tells quite another story.
Bang, bang, rattle, rattle, bang, bang again,
down it goes; now loud, now low, now loud
again, and then softer and softer, until the
sound gradually becomes inaudible. One
false step on this villanous floor, and the thing
is settled. You roll over, as a matter of
course; and, as another matter of course,
that hideous niche receives you into its jaws,
ever gaping for prey, like the jaws of a
sleeping
alligator in fly time; and then comes the
plunge of the three hundred feet, the crashing
of bone and flesh, thepah!
But let us sit down by its brink; the guide
has many a wild and dreary story to tell,
which can be best told in such a place as
this.
And, first, he tells us that this identical
abyssthe Crevice Pit, as it is called
sounded by Mr. Lee in 1835, with a string
having a stone tied to the end of it, was
sounded, many a long year before, by the
miners, pretty much in the same way; only
that, instead of a stone to the string, they
had a
young negro
tied to the end of it.
However, this highly original plummet, it
appears, was tied on with its own consent,
the lad being a bold romantic fellow,
ambitious
to signalize himself by a daring exploit,
and perhaps a brilliant discovery. Down,
therefore, into the pit they lowered him;
though with an effect singularly resembling
that attending the Knight of La Mancha's
descent into the cave of Montesinos. The
rope suddenly became light, its burden had
vanished; though, in due course of time, it
again felt heavy in the hands of the miners,
who, drawing it up, found the adventurer at
its end as before. Some very wondrous
story he told them, with great glee, of his
having discovered, fifty or sixty feet below,
a spacious and splendid cave, in which he
had walked; but as he never after could be,
by any persuasions, induced to attempt a
second descent, it was thought he had
imitated
Don Quixote to the letter, ensconced
himself on the first convenient ledge or shelf,
and dreamed the remainder of the
adventure
.
The Mammoth Cave, as I observed, was
wrought for saltpetre during the last war,
when the price of that article was so high,
and the profits of the manufacturer so great,
as to set half the western world gadding
after nitre cavesthe gold mines of their
day. Cave hunting, in fact, became a kind
of mania, beginning with speculators, and
ending with hair-brained young men, who
dared from the love of adventure the risks
that others ran for profit. As might be
expected
,
this passion was not always indulged
without accident; and several caves in
Kentucky
and Tennessee obtained a mournful
celebrity
as the scenes of painful suffering and
disaster
.
In some cases, caves have been entered
by explorers who were never again known to
leave them, and around whose fate yet hangs
the deepest mystery. Accidents, not
attended
with loss of life, were of frequent
occurrence
;
and, as for frights, they were lumped
together in report, in the style of a
constable's
inventory, as too tedious to mention.
Among the tragical incidents illustrative
of the time and the mania, told by the guide
at the Crevice Pit, the following I consider
worthy of being recorded, and the more so
as it occurred within the immediate vicinity,
and had therefore gained nothing by
Travelling with increase from mouth to mouth.
Four or five miles from the Mammoth
Cave, a few paces from the bridle-path over
the Knobs, by which the visiter coming from
Bell's at the Three Forks, reaches it, is a
cave known as the Pit Cave, though
sometimes
called, I believe, Wright's Cave, after
the name of the person who first attempted
to explore it. This man was a speculator,
who having some reason to believe the cave
a valuable one, resolved to examine it; but
possessing little knowledge of caves and less
of the business of the nitre-maker, he applied
to Mr. Gatewood, the proprietor of the works
at the Mammoth Cave, and of course
experienced
in both these particulars, to assist
him in the search. A day was accordingly
appointed, on which Mr. Gatewood agreed
to meet him at the cave, and conduct the
exploration
in person. But on that day, as it
happened, there arose a furious storm of rain
and thunder; and Mr. Gatewood, not
supposing
that even Wright himself would, under
such circumstances, keep the appointment,
remained at his own works. In the
meanwhile
,
however, Wright had reached the cave,
in company with another man, a miner, though
of no great experience in cave-hunting; and
with him, finding that Mr. Gatewood did not
come, and having made all his preparations,
he resolved to undertake the exploration
himself
.
This the two men commenced, and
pursued for several hours without accident
and without fear, seeing, indeed, nothing to
excite alarm, except a cluster of very
dangerous
pits, which they passed while engaged in
the search. But by and by, having consumed
much time in rambling about, they
discovered
that by some extraordinary oversight,
they had left their store of candles at the
mouth of the cave, having brought in with
them only those they carried in their hands,
which were now burning low. The horrors
of their situation at once flashed on their
minds; they were at a great distance from
the entrance, which there was little hope they
could reach with what remained of their
candles, and the terrible pits were directly on
their path. It was thought, however, that if
they could succeed in passing these, it might
be possible to grope their way from the cave
in the dark, as the portion beyond the pits
offered no unusual interruptions, and was
without branches. The attempt was made;
and as desperation gave speed to their feet,
they had, at last, the inexpressible
satisfaction
to reach the pits, and to pass them in
VOL. II.9
safety, leaving them several hundred feet
behind
,
ere their lights entirely failed. But now
began their difficulties. In the confusion and
agitation of mind which beset them at the
moment when the last candle expired, they
neglected to set their faces firmly towards
the entrance; and in consequence, when
darkness
at last suddenly surrounded them, they
were bewildered and at variance, Wright
vehemently insisting that they should
proceed
in one direction, the miner contending
with equal warmth that the other was the
right one. The violence of Wright
prevailed
over the doubts of his follower, who
allowed
himself to be governed by the former,
especially when the desperate man offered to
lead the way, so as to be the first to
encounter
the pits, supposing he should be wrong.
An expedient for testing the safety of the
path, which Wright hit upon, had also its
effect on his companion's mind; he proposed,
as he crawled along on his hands and feet
the only way they dare attempt to proceed in
the dark over the broken floorto throw
stones before him, by means of which it would
be easy to tell when a pit lay in the way. The
miner, accordingly, though with many
misgivings
,
suffered himself to be ruled, and
followed
at Wright's heels, the latter every
moment
hurling a stone before him, and at every
throw uttering some hurried exclamation, now
a prayer, now a word of counsel or
encouragement
to his companion, though always
expressive
of the deepest agitation and disorder
of mind. They had proceeded in this way
for several moments, until even the miner
himself, believing that if they were in error,
they had crawled far enough to reach the pits,
became convinced his employer was in the
right path; when suddenly the clang of one of
the stones cast by Wright, falling as if on the
solid floor, was succeeded by a rushing sound,
the clatter of loose rocks rolling down a
declivity
,
and then a heavy hollow crash at a
depth beneath. He called to Wright; no
answer
was returned; all was dismal silence;
not even a groan from the wretched employer
replied to the call. His fate the terrified
miner
understood in a moment: the first of the
pits was, at one part of its brink, shelving;
on the declivity thus formed, the stone cast
by Wright had lodged; but Wright had
slipped
from it into the pit, and slipped so
suddenly
as not to have time to utter even one
cry of terror. The miner, overcome with
horror, after calling again and again without
receiving any answer, or hearing any sound
whatever, turned in the opposite direction, and
endeavoured to effect his own escape from
the cave. He wandered about many hours,
now sinking down in despair, now struggling
again for life; until at last yielding to his fate
in exhaustion of mind and body, incapable of
making any further exertions, a sudden ray
of light sparkled in his face. He rushed
forward
it
was the morning-star shining through
the mouth of the cave! The alarm was
immediately
given. Mr. Gatewood, with a
party of his labourers, hurried to the cave
and to the pit, on whose shelving edge
were seen evidences enough of some heavy
body having lately rolled into it. The offer
of a reward conquered the terror of one of
the workmen, who was lowered with ropes
to the bottom of the pit, a depth of fifty or
sixty feet; and Wright's lifeless body was
drawn out.
The above tragical incident I have heard
confirmed by the lips of several different
persons
;
one of whom, however, contested the
right of the morning-star to figure in it;
affirming that the miner made his way out
before night, and that it was the light of day,
shining at a distance
like
a star, which gave
rise to that poetical embellishment. I believe
he was right. It is thus, like a starthe
loveliest of all the lamps that spangle the
vault of nightthat daylight breaks from
afar upon the adventurer, returning from the
depths of the Mammoth Cave.

THE MURDERS OF THE CAVE INNGRAND
GALLERY
THE
CHURCHNITRE WORKSHAUNTED
CHAMBERS.
Among
other stories told at the Crevice
Pit, was onewild, and terrible enough, if
trueof a man who, in former days, was
master of a little tavern on a public road,
some twenty miles off; at which place of
entertainment
,
it began to be remarked by the
neighbours, more travellers called than were
ever known to leave it. Immediately behind
the house, not fifty yards from the road, is a
cavern, which, if its interior corresponds with
its entrance, must be of uncommon grandeur.
It opens from the level ground, by a sink or
declivity like that of the Mammoth Cave;
but the descent is much less precipitous, as
well as wider and longer, making a wild little
glen, studded with rocks, bushes, and trees,
that terminates under a vast, marble-looking
arch, the mouth of the cave. The view from
this mouth, looking back to the glen, is
inexpressibly
grand and beautifula vista, or
picture, one might fancy, of a waste nook of
Paradise, set or framed in a grotto-work of
stone. The cavern is said to continue only
for about a hundred yards, when it is
sudderly
lost in a vast pit of unknown depth.
The keeper of the Cave Inn the story
represents
as a dark villain, accustomed to rob
and murder all travellers rich enough to
reward
his trouble; for which purpose, as well
as for that of concealment, the cave behind the
house afforded him unusual facilities. His plan
of proceedings, when he had resolved the death
of a traveller, was, first, under the plea of
looking after the victim's horse, before going
to bed, to lead the animal from the stable
into the cave, and force him into the pit; then,
with an appearance of concern, to inform the
traveller his beast had strayed into the cave
among the rocks, whence he could not remove
him without assistance; and thus obtain the
latter to accompany him into the infernal den;
where, arriving at the chasm, a sudden blow
or push precipitated the human victim also
into the gulf, and with him all evidence of the
crime by which he had perished.
This horrible story I afterwards heard
repeated
by other persons, some of whom
declared
that the innkeeper's villany had been
finally brought to light by the confessions of
an agonized wife, the witness, though not the
accomplice, of his murders; while others
thought that his guilt rested merely upon
suspicion
,
for which the sudden disappearance
of several travellers unfortunately gave too
many grounds. I must confess that none of
my informants were very positive in their
modes of telling the story, and none able to
vouch for its truth; while one cautious, or
judicious, personage professed an entire
disbelief
in the innkeeper's guilt, hinting that
the whole story had grown out of the wild
prattling of a woman, the poor man's wife,
who was, in the narrator's opinion, a mere
unhappy lunatic. The tale, however, had
currency enough to give the suspected man
trouble, and he soon afterwards left the
country
,
and was no more heard of.
But let us retrace our steps to the
Vestibule
;
let us enter the Grand Gallery; for we
have yet much to seeor rather, we have
all
to seeand much to hear.
The Grand Gallery is a hundred feet wide,
with an average height of forty or fifty. Its
roof is, for the most part, flat and regular; its
walls broken by massive buttresses, that here
and there stare out of the gloom, and salute
us with a rocky frown. Fancy traces among
them a thousand majestic resemblances to
scenes recollected, or imagined, in the
external
world. On the right hand, we see the
Rocky Mountainsthe Chippewyan in little,
without the superfluous caps of snow; on the
left, the Cliffs of Kentuckyexcellent
likenesses
all, as far as crags fifty feet high, bare
and desolate, and shrouded in never-ending
night, can resemble cliffs of three hundred
feet, adorned with trees and flowers, shining
like marble in the brave sunshine, and
glassing
their beauty in the crystal river below.
Among these Kentucky cliffs, just under the
ceiling, is a gap in the wall, into which you
can scramble, and make your way down a
chaotic gulf, creeping like a rat under and
among huge loose rocks, to a depth of eighty
or ninety feetthat is, you can do all this,
provided you do not break your neck before
you get half way.
A hundred yards further on, the roof
suddenly
sinks somewhat, forming an inclined
plane, on which clouds seem to float as in a
midnight sky. And here Nature, who, in
these same clouds, proves that she is not so
good a painter below the earth as she is
above, has scooped out a spacious cove on
the left hand, as wide and high as the Grand
Gallery into which it opens, but of little more
than a hundred feet in extent. Here, among
rude rocks, has been constructed a still ruder
altara wooden desk, or pulpit; from which,
while torches shone around from crag to
crag, the preacher has proclaimed the word
of God, and the voices of a congregation
have arisen in solemn hosannas. The
services
of worship in such a place must have
been strangely and profoundly impressive. It
is a cathedral which, man feels, has been piled,
not by the art of man, but by the will of his
Maker. But it is a place to inculcate
religious
fear, rather than pious affection.
Another hundred yards beyond the Church
for so the cove of the pulpit is calledand
you find yourself again among the ruins of
nitre works. The spacious floor is occupied
with vats filled in with earth, which is now,
however, beginning to sink, giving to the
place somewhat the air of an ancient and
neglected cemeterya cemetery of
Brobdignags
.
A tall frame-work of timbers, that
once supported a forcing pump, is yet
standing
in the midst. Opposite to it, a ladder is
seen resting against the right hand wall.
Looking up, you perceive a gap in the wall
fifty feet wide, and twenty high, with several
huge rocks lying in it, one of them looking
like a tower commanding the savage pass.
This is the entrance of the Haunted
Chambers
.

GRAND GALLERYCAVE ATMOSPHERE

TUBESBRIDGE GALLERYTHE BELL
STALACTITESTHE REGISTER ROOMTHE MINER
AND THE DEVILS.
We
have arrived, then, at the entrance of
the Haunted Chambersa distance of barely
half a mile from the mouth of the cave; and
we have still seven or eight miles of wonders
before us. To describe these in detail would
be an endless undertaking, and, to the reader
a dull and unprofitable oneas no
description
,
however minute, could possibly convey
accurate ideas of them. In fact, an extended
description of a cave would, in any case,
prove wearisome. The componentsthe
elements of caves are few and simplerocks,
stalactites, pools, pits, and darkness make up
all their variety; and however interestingly,
and even variously, these may be combined
to the eye of an actual spectator, the
descriptions
of them must consist of repetitions
of the same wordsof changes rung over
and over again upon the same ideas. My
aim is, therefore, not so much to describe the
Mammoth Cave in detail, as to present a
general idea of it, pausing to dwell, here and
there, upon features that are most important
and interesting, and upon the impressions
produced by them on the visiter's mind.
But let us, before resuming our
explorations
,
say a word of the atmosphere of the
cave; which, having been, at the entrance,
pronounced so
icy
, it may be feared, still
retains
its hyperborean character. It is icy,
however, as we soon discover, only by
contrast
.
The transition from an atmosphere
of 90 or 95 degrees without, into one of
about 55 or 60 within the cave, may well
make us shiver for a moment. The average
temperature of the Mammoth Cave is about
58 degrees Fahr. In summer it rises a few
degrees higher, and in winter sinks as many
below. It is, therefore, always temperate.
Its purity, judging from its effects upon the
lungs, and from other circumstances, is
remarkable
,
VOL. II.10
though in what its purity consists
I know not. But be its composition what it
may, it is certain, that its effects upon the
spirits and bodily powers of visiters are
extremely
exhilarating; and that it is not less
salubrious than enlivening. The nitre-diggers
were a famously healthy set of men: it was a
common and humane practice to employ
labourers of enfeebled constitutions, who were
soon restored to health and strength, though
kept at constant labour; and more joyous,
merry fellows were never seen. The oxen,
of which several were kept, day and night, in
the cave hauling the nitrous earth, were, after
a month or two of toil, in as fine condition
for the shambles as if fattened in the stall.
The ordinary visiter, though rambling a
dozen hours or more over paths of the
roughest
and most difficult kinds, is seldom
conscious
of fatigue, until he returns to the upper
air; and then it seems to him, at least in the
summer season, that he has exchanged the
atmosphere of paradise for that of a charnel
warmed by steam, all, without, is so heavy,
so dank, so dead, so mephitic. Awe, and
even apprehension, if that has been felt, soon
yield to the influence of the delicious air of
the cave; and, after a time, a certain jocund
feeling is found mingled with the deepest
impressions
of sublimity, which there are so
many objects to awake. I recommend all
broken-hearted lovers and dyspeptic dandies
to carry their complaints to the Mammoth
Cave, where they will undoubtedly find
themselves
translated into very buxom and
happy persons, before they are aware of it.
In the Grand Gallery, opposite the
entrance
of the Haunted Chambers, are, as was
previously mentioned, the ruins of the old
nitre-worksleaching-vats, pump frames, and
lines of wooden pipes. Of the last there are
two different ranges, one of which was
formerly
used for bringing fresh water from the
dripping-spring to the vats; the other for
forcing
it, when saturated with the salt, back to
the furnaces at the mouth of the cave. These
pipes, now mouldering with dry-rot, serve at
present no other purpose than to amuse
visiters
;
they are acoustical telegraphs, through
which the adventurer who has penetrated so
far, can transmit to his more timid friend at
the entrance an assurance that he is yet in
safety. A whisper bears the intelligence:
even a sigh, breathed into the tube, falls as
distinctly on the ear half a mile off as if the
friend who breathed it were reclining at the
listener's elbow.
At this place, the roof of the Grand
Gallery
,
perhaps thirty or thirty-five feet high,
suddenly rises to about the height of fifty,
which it however preserves for a distance of
only fifty or sixty feet, when it again sinks to
its former level. The break thus made in
the ceiling, forms a part of the continuous
lines of the Haunted Chambers, which may
be considered as an independent cave,
running
at right angles with the Mammoth, and
above
it; although, dipping downward, as it
crosses from right to left, it has broken
through into the latter. It can be entered
only on the right hand, where it opens in the
wall, fifteen or more feet from the floor; a
wide and lofty passage, cumbered with rocks,
the chief of which is the Tower Rock,a
massive block, that looks, when viewed from
below, the guide perched, flambeau in hand,
on the top, like some old Saxon strong-hold
not yet in ruins. You see this cave
continued
also on the left hand, where is a gap
in the wall still wider and higher, but choked
up by an immense mound of coarse sand
and gravel, impacted and hardened by time,
which has entirely obliterated the passage.
Curiosity has not yet attempted to dig a
path through this barrier, heaped up by some
mighty flood of old days; though a few hours'
labor might perhaps disclose a new batch of
wonders and mysteries. Clambering up the
huge sand-heap, till you reach what from
below seemed the ceiling, you perceive on
one hand a broad cornice-work like that seen
in the Vestibule, which runs from the
choked-up
passage clear across the Grand Gallery,
until it is lost in the entrance of the Haunted
Chambers opposite. Surveying this
cornice-work
more closely, you find that it consists
of a broad horizontal plate of rock, forming
a gallery, or bridge, by which you may walk
across the Grand Gallery, immediately under
its roof, into the Haunted Chambers,
landing
on the top of the Tower Rock. But it
is an
Al-Sirat
,a bridge for disembodied
spirits, rather than mortals of flesh and bone,
to traverse. It has an ugly inclination or
dip downwards, and looks as if expressly
contrived for dropping ambitious personages
into the horrible profound below. Shall
we
enter the Haunted Chambers by this highway
of the dauntlessthe Bridge Gallery, so
narrow
,
so treacherous, so dizzy? Not if we
were as solidipous as an elephant; not if we
10*
had air-pumps to our feet, like lizards and
house-flies. The broad ladder laid against
the wall, rickety and somewhat rungless
though it be, and leading humbly, a
lubberway
,
to the foot of the Tower, is more to
our own taste. It is but six or seven
well-stretched
steps from rung to rung, and we
are in the Haunted Chambers, whose name
itself fills us with expectant awe.
Our guide leaves us to admire alone the
gulf-like abyss of the Grand Gallery, now
under our feet; he has stolen away in
advance
,
and his steps are no longer heard
clattering
along the rocky path. But hark! what
sound is that, like the deep bell of a
cathedral
,
or the gong of a theatre, booming in the
distance, peal after peal, clang after clang,
so solemn, so wild, so strange? A walk,
with a few stumbles and tumbleswe have
not yet our cave-legs (there are cave-legs as
well as sea-legs)reveals the mystery; and
we discover our conductor standing under a
pendent stalactite, thumping it with great
enthusiasm
and a big stone, and filling the
sursounding
vaults with the clangour of his flinty
drum. This is one of the many
bells
(so
called) which the Mammoth Cave, in
common
with most other caves, possesses.
We have reached, then, the abode of
stalactites
?
Ay, here they are, pillars old and dry
(for the oozing springs that formed them
have long since vanished), venerable and
majestic columns, once perhaps white and
ghastly, like so many giants in winding-sheets,
but now black, withered, and mummy-like,
begrimed with smoke, that has been
fastening
around them for many generations. Here
we see them in groves, looking like the trunks
of an old forest at midnight, the rough
concretions
on the low roof seeming not unlike
the umbrage of thick-matted boughs; there
they appear singly, or in cosy family groups
Noibe and her children, Dian and her
nymphs, or any such mythologic partythat
Nature, like an idle sculptor, began, a
thousand
years ago, to hew out of stone, without,
however, hewing enough to enable us to guess
what might have been her real intentions.
The name of the Haunted Chambers,
however
poetical it may be, is incorrect,
inasmuch
as it conveys the idea of a series of
different chambers; whereas this branch of
the cave consists of but a single passage,
fifty or sixty feet wide and half a mile long,
leading to a lower branch, which is of equal
extent, though of inferior width. The whole
length of the Haunted Chambers is, therefore,
one mile. The upper branch is chiefly
remarkable
on account of its stalactites; at the
foot of one of whichthe Arm-chair, as it is
called, from having a very royal seat
hollowed
in its sideis a little basin or pool of
stone, that once received a drip of water
strongly charged with sulphur, from the roof
above. It is now dry, the spring having
gradually sealed up the crack through which
it formerly flowed. Another remarkable
feature
of this branch is seen in its ceiling, which,
except in the immediate neighbourhood of the
stalactitic formations, where it is studded over
with concretions of all imaginable shapes,
is surprisingly flat and smooth, and in some
places white, looking as if it had been
actually
finished off by the plasterer. This is
particularly observable in a place called the
Register Room, where, the roof being low
enough for the purpose, visiters frequently
trace their names with the smoke of a candle;
and many hundreds of such records of vanity
are already to be seen deforming the ceiling.
Its smoothness is owing to an incrustation or
deposit of calcareous matter on the surface of
the rock; though how it could ever be
deposited
so regularly may well be wondered.
Within two hundred yards of the
termination
of this Upper Branch of the Haunted
Chambers, the visiter finds himself suddenly
plunging down a steep of loose red sand,
poetically entitled the Lover's Leap, into a
hollow; at the bottom of which, in the left
hand wall, is a very narrow but lofty fissure,
the Devil's Elbow, winding through the wall
and leading into the Lower Branch; where,
under the roots of the stalactites that pillar
the branch above, he may spend an hour
or two among domes, pits, and sounding
springs that come spouting or showering down
from the roof, with the name, if not the
grandeur
and beauty, of waterfalls. The great
Domeor Bonaparte's Grand Dome, as the
guides delight to call itis a lofty excavation,
in figure of a truncated cone, in the solid
roof, from which a prodigious mass of rocks
must have fallen to make it. These rocks
are, however, no where to be seen; the floor
is flat and solid below. They must have been
swept away by some raging flood; or, it may
be, that there was formerly, below the dome,
a pit, into which they fell, the pit being thus
filled up, and its entrance gradually
obliterated
by incrustation.
The Haunted Chambers are said to owe
their name to an adventure that befell one of
the miners in former days, which is thus
related
.In
the Lower Branch is a room called
the Salts Room, which produces considerable
quantities of the Sulphate of Magnesia, or of
Soda, we forget whicha mineral that the
proprietor of the cave did not fail to turn to
account. The miner in question was a new
and raw handof course neither very well
acquainted
with the cave itself, nor with the
approved
modes of averting or repairing
accidents
,
to which, from the nature of their
occupation
,
the miners were greatly exposed.
Having been sent, one day, in charge of an
older workman, to the Salts Room to dig a
few sacks of the salt, and finding that the path
to this sequestered nook was pefectly plain,
and that, from the Haunted Chambers being
a single, continuous passage, without branches,
it was impossible to wander from it, our hero
disdained, on his second visit, to seek or accept
assistance, and trudged off to his work alone.
The circumstance being common enough, he
was speedily forgotten by his brother miners;
and it was not until several hours after, when
they all left off their toil for the more
agreeable
duty of eating their dinner, that his
absence
was remarked, and his heroical
resolution
to make his way alone to the Salts Room
remembered. As it was apparent, from the
time he had been gone, that some accident
must have happened him, half a dozen men, the
most of them negroes, stripped half naked,
their usual working costume, were sent to
hunt him up, a task supposed to be of no great
difficulty, unless he had fallen into a pit. In
the meanwhile, the poor miner, it seems, had
succeeded in reaching the Salts Room, filling
his sack, and retracing his steps half way
back to the Grand Gallery; when, finding the
distance greater than he thought it ought to
be, the conceit entered his unlucky brain that
he
might
perhaps be going wrong. No sooner
had the suspicion struck him, than he fell into
a violent terror, dropped his sack, ran
backwards
,
then returned, then ran back again,
each time more frightened and bewildered than
before; until at last he ended his adventures by
tumbling over a stone and extinguishing his
lamp. Thus left in the dark, not knowing where
to turn, frightened out of his wits besides, he
fell to remembering his sinsalways
remembered
by those who are lost in the Mammoth
Caveand praying with all his might for
succour. But hours passed away, and
assistance
came not: the poor fellow's frenzy
increased
;
he felt himself a doomed man, he
thought his terrible situation was a judgment
imposed on him for his wickedness; nay, he
even believed, at last, that he was no longer
an inhabitant of the earththat he had been
translated, even in the body, to the place of
tormentin other words, that he was in hell
itself, the prey of the devils, who would
presently
be let loose upon him. It was at this
moment the miners in search of him made
their appearance: they lighted upon his sack,
lying where he had thrown it, and set up a
great shout, which was the first intimation he
had of their approach. He started up, and
seeing them in the distance, the half-naked
negroes in advance, all swinging their torches
aloft, he, not doubting they were those
identical
devils whose appearance he had been
expecting, took to his heels, yelling lustily for
mercy; nor did he stop, notwithstanding the
calls of his amazed friends, until he had
fallen
a second time among the rocks, where he
lay on his face, roaring for pity, until, by dint
of much pulling and shaking, he was
convinced
that he was still in the world and the
Mammoth Cave. Such is the story they tell
of the Haunted Chambers, the name having
been given to commemorate the incident.
This Salts Room contains a pit, if we can
so call a huge domed chamber below,
communicating
with it by means of a narrow
crack in the floor. The floor is here very
thin, in fact, a mere scale of rock, but,
fortunately
,
rock of the most adamantine
character
.
By lowering down torches, and peeping
through the crack, one dimly discerns the
chamber below. Its floor is at a depth of
fifty feet, and is composed of firm and dry
sand or clay. It seems like the vestibule of
a new set of chambers, which no one has yet
explored. An attempt was made by our little
party to examine it, by lowering the lightest
individual of the company into the pit with
ropesan enterprise that was baffled, and
had nearly produced a fatal termination,
in consequence of the rope's parting, or
beginning
to part, at the moment when our
adventurous
explorer was hanging midway
down the pit. With a good rope, however,
nothing would be more easy than to reach the
bottom in safety.

But
let us resume our explorations in the
Grand Gallery.
Three hundred yards beyond the mouth of
the Haunted Chambers, proceeding along this
wide, lofty, ever frowning, and ever majestic
highway, on the brow of a hill, you perceive,
on the left hand, a broad chasm, reaching to
the ceiling, its floor heaped with huge rocks,
This is the Ruined, or Rocky Cave, extending
a distance of a hundred and fifty yards, wide
and high throughout, but its floor covered
with blocks of stone of the most gigantic
size, some exceeding twenty feet in cubic
dimensions
,
and weighing six hundred tons. In
this cave, spread out upon the path, you find
a relic of the ancient inhabitants of the place.
It is an Indian mat of bark, a cloak perhaps
or a part of one, for it is only a fragment
about a yard square. It may have covered,
in its day, the shoulders of a warrior of
renown
,
or of a maiden, the pride and beauty
of her clan; in which thought we will but
look upon it, and pass it reverently by.
A hundred yards further on, the Grand
Gallery makes a majestic sweep to the right.
Just where the curve begins, you see, lying
against the right hand wall, a huge oblong
rock, pointed at its further extremity like the
prow of a ship. The Adam that gave names
to the lions of the cave has christened this
rock the Steamboat; and, it must be
confessed
,
that it looks very much like a steamboat,
only that wheels, and wheel-houses are
entirely
wanting; not to speak of smoke-stacks
and the superstructure of cabins, pilot-boxes,
and so on. It was some considerable period
years, in factafter this Steamboat was
observed reposing in her river of stone, before
any curious person thought of peeping round
her bows, to see what might be concealed
behind them. The peep revealed an
unanticipated
mystery. A narrow, but quite easy
passage was discovered, leading into a
circular
room a hundred feet in diameter, with
a low roof, and broken floor, hollowed like a
bowl, covered with sand and gravel, in which
floor were two different holes or pits, leading
to unknown chambers below. This room is
the Vestibule of the Deserted Chambers, but
more frequently called, in allusion to its figure,
the Wooden Bowl. The holes, which are so
small as only to admit one person to creep
down them at a time, are called the Dog and
Snake Holes, and are, in many respects,
worthy
of their names. By descending either of
them to a depth of twenty or thirty feet, we
find ourselves at once in the Deserted
Chambers
to
many the most impressive and
terrific
portion of the cave. Here the visiter, if
he has not felt bewildered before, finds
himself
at last in a labyrinth, from which no
sagacity
or courage of his own could remove
hima chaos of winding branches, once the
beds of subterraneous torrents; and he almost
dreads, at each step, to see the banished
floods come roaring upon him from some
midnight chamber. Now he beholds great
rocksmighty flakes scaling from the roof
hanging over him,in one place so low that
he must stoop to pass under them,yet
suspended
to the roof only by an edge or a
corner
.
What was the sword of Damocles to
these treacherous traps, that would, any one of
them, provided it should fall, smash a
rhinoceros
with as much ease as a basket of eggs?
The ram of a pile-engine were a falling
feather
in comparison. Now he startles aghast,
as hollow echoes under his feet bespeak the
dismal abyss from which he is separated only
by a thin shell of floor. Now he stands
trembling on the brink of a horrible chasm,
down which the rock he has toppled goes
crashing and rumbling to an immeasurable
depth; or now listens, with little less of awe,
at the verge of another, in which, far down,
he can hear the obscure dashings of a
waterfall
.
Now he sits upon a cragperhaps
alonefor if he would, for once in his life,
feel what solitude is, (a thing man knows
nothing of, even in desert islands or the
solitary cells of a prison,)
here
is the place
to try the experimentwith nameless
passages
yawning all around him, in a wilderness
and desert such as his imagination never
before
dreamed of, reading such a lesson of his
impotence and insignificance as not even the
stars or the billows of the ocean can teach
him. In short, the Deserted Chambers are
11*
terrific, chaotic, and not to be conceived of
by those who have not seen them; for which
reason I will not attempt the task of
description
.
It may be observed, however, that
they consist of three principal branches, one
of which is nearly a mile long, another the
third of a mile, the remaining one only three
or four hundred yards; and that all three are
full of pits, domes, and springs without
number
.
The shortest branch contains three or
four fearful pits. Over one of these, called
the Side-saddle Pit, projects a rock, affording
a very comfortable seat to any visiter who
chooses to peep into the den of darkness
beneath
,
or the dome arching above it. Another,
a well of fourteen or fifteen feet diameter, is
covered by a thin plate of rock, lying on it
like the cover of a pot, though a cover
somewhat
too small for the vessel, and seemingly
supported only at one point. This is both a
very curious and a very dangerous pit.
But the chief glory of this branch is the
Bottomless Pit, so called,
par excellence
, and
suspected by many to run pretty nearly
through the whole diameter of the earth.
The branch terminates in it, and the explorer
suddenly finds himself brought up on its brink,
standing upon a projecting platform,
surrounded
on three sides by darkness and
terror
,
a gulf on the right hand, a gulf on the
left, and before him what seems an
interminable
void. He looks aloft; but no eye has
yet reached the top of the great overarching
dome; nothing is there seen but the flashing
of water dropping from above, and smiling,
as it shoots by, in the unwonted gleam of
the lamps. He looks below, and nothing
there meets his glance, save darkness as
thick as lamp-black; but he hears a wild,
mournful melody of waters, the wailing of
the brook for the green and sunny channel
left in the upper world, never more to be
revisited
.
Truly, as we sit upon the brink
listening
,
the complaining of those plaintive
drops doth breath a sad and woful
melancholy
into our inmost spirits, a nostalgic
longing for the bright and beautiful world we
have left behind us. Who could believe, in
this dismal cave, that earth was otherwise
than a paradise? that rogues and rascals
made up a part of its population? No, our
remembrance, here, is only of the good and
pure, the just and gentle, the noble and the
beautiful; those for whose society we may
yearn with a pleasant sorrow, with tears as
bright and pure as these falling drops, with
sighs and murmurings as sweetly sad as these
of the caverned fountain.
But sweetly sad they sound no more.
Down goes a rock, tumbled over the cliff by
the guide, who is of opinion that folks come
hither to see and hear, not to muse and be
melancholy. There it goescrash; it has
reached the bottom. Nohark! it strikes
again; once more and again, still falling, still
striking. Will it never stop? One's hair
begins to bristle, as he hears the sound
repeated
,
growing less and less, until the ear
can follow it no longer. Certainly, if the Pit
of Fredericshall be eleven thousand feet deep,
the Bottomless Pit of the Mammoth Cave
must be its equal: for two minutes, at least,
we can hear the stone descending.
But there is, it appears to me, something
deceptive in this mode of estimating the
depth of a pit. Mr. Lee sounded the pit in
question with a line; and, bottomless though
it be, found bottom at a depth of one hundred
and seventy-three feet; though he supposed,
as every one else who hurls stones into it,
will suppose, that his plummet had struck a
shelf, the bottom of the pit being in reality a
great many fathoms beneath. Nothing would
be easier than to ascertain, by throwing stones
into it, the depth of a pit of perpendicular
descent, and having smooth continuous walls.
But it must be remembered that all such
cavities are very broken and ragged, with
numberless shelves and other projections, on
which have lodged stones and rubbish from
the mouldering walls above. A stone being
cast into such a pit, if it be very deep, will
naturally strike upon some shelf, from which
it dislodges much of the rubbish, that falls
with it to the bottom, each fragment making a
louder or fainter noise, according to its weight;
and of these particles the smallest ones,
which are those that make the least noise,
will be the longest in rolling off their perch;
though, of course, once off it, they will fall
as rapidly as the others. Allowing that the
bottom of the pit were but a few yards below
the shelf, it will be easy to perceive that the
sound of these dislodged particles, falling
after the stone to the bottom, the heaviest
first and the lightest last, would produce all
the phenomena caused by a single stone
dropping from ledge to ledge for a long time,
and consequently through a great depth.
There is, and, indeed, can be, no certainty
except in the line and plummet.
A few hundred feet back from this
Bottomless
Pit, is a narrow chasm, called the
Covered Way, which, on being followed, is
found to terminate in the
side
of the pit, fifty
feet below the platform; which is perhaps as
great a depth into the pit as any visiter will
ever choose to venture.
CHAPTER VIII.
GRAND GALLERY, CONTINUEDCROSS ROOMS
CHIMNEYSBLACK CHAMBERSBEWILDERED
VISITERSTHE CATARACTSSOLITARY CAVE
AN INCIDENT.
Returning
again to the Grand Gallery,
and pursuing the majestic curve it makes at
the place of the Steamboat, we find it
presently
taking another and more abrupt sweep
to the left, still wide, lofty, and impressive.
In the angle here made, we see the opening
into another cave,the Sick Room,which,
running back, and under the Haunted
Chambers
,
terminates at last under the Grand
Gallery near the Church, where was
originally
another outlet, now covered over with
rubbish.
The visiter has now before him a walk of a
thousand yards; which having accomplished,
he will perhaps lay aside his enthusiasm for
a moment, to wonder how he is ever to get
back again. Throughout the whole of this
distance, the floor of the cave is strown over
with loose rocks,flakes from the ceiling
and crags from the wall,of all imaginable
sizes and shapes, over which the labour of
trudging, at least at the pace the guide holds
most agreeable, is inconceivably great; while
a certain natural anxiety to avoid tumbling
into the numberless gaps betwixt the huge
rough blocks, and to step upon the slabs,
which eternally see-saw under your feet,
precisely
at the point that will enable you to
preserve your equilibrium, adds greatly to
your distresses; while, at the same time, it
prevents
your taking any note of the grandeur
around, except when the guide occasionally
pauses to point out some remarkable object,
the Keel-boat, (a tremendous rock sixty or
seventy feet long, fifteen wide, and depth
unknown
.)the
Devil's Looking-Glass, (which
is a hugh plate of stone standing erect,)the
Snow Room, (where even a lusty halloo
brings down from the ceiling a shower of
saline flakes, as white and beautiful almost
as those of snow itself,)and other such
curiosities. In another visit, he will perhaps
show you what you did not before suspect, that
you have passed many different openings in
the left wall, running into caves called the Side
Cuts, in consequence of all of them winding
back again into the Grand Gallery. In one
of them is a perforation,the Black Hole,
leading into the Deserted Chambers, forming
the third entrance to those wild and dreary
vaults. Throughout the whole of this space
of a thousand yards, the Grand Gallery is
worthy of its name, being uniformly of the
grandest dimensions and aspect. In two
places, the rocks covering the floor are of
such vast size, and lie heaped in such
singular
confusion, that fancy has traced in them
a resemblance to the ruins of demolished
cities, Troglodytic Luxors, and Palmyras;
and they bear the names of the First and
Second Cities.
But we have accomplished the thousand
yards, the guide pauses to give us rest; we
have reached a new region, we look upon a
new spectacle; we are in the Cross Rooms,
(so called,) at the entrance of the Black
Chambers. A wilder, sublimer scene
imagination
could scarcely paint; even Martin
might here take a lesson in the grand and
VOL. II.12
terrible. The Grand Gallery, previously
contracted
,
in a short bend, to a width of thirty
or forty feet, suddenly expands to the width
of more than a hundred, which it preserves
throughout a length of five hundred feet.
Midway
of this noble hall, on the left hand,
running
at right angles with it, is seen another
apartment, a hundred and fifty feet wide, and,
measuring from its opening, more than two
hundred long; or, if we add to it the width of
the Grand Gallery, three hundred feet long;
the two rooms thus uniting into one in the
shape of the letter T. The whole of this
prodigious
area is strown with rocks of enormous
size, tumbled together in a manner that
cannot
be described, and looking, especially in
the transeptal portion, where confusion is by
them worse confounded, like the ruins of some
old castle of the Demi-gods, too ponderous
to stand, yet too massive to decay. This
apartment is bounded, or rather divided, at
what seems its end, by ragged cliffs forming
a kind of very large island, into two branches,
through both of which, clambering aloft
among the rugged blocks and up two
crannies
,
called the Chimneys, very irregular and
bewildering, you can penetrate into the Black
Chambers above. The whole extent of these
chambers, which are black and dismal, as
their name denotes, does not exceed six or
seven hundred yards; and there is nothing
in them, though they contain several domes
arched over mountains of fallen sandstone,
with a few stalactites and clusters of crystals
here and there, to compare in interest with
their entrance. The greatest curiosities,
perhaps
,
are four or five piles of stones looking
like rude altars, and so denominated, left
thus heaped up by the Autochthones of the
cave; though for what purpose it is difficult
to imagine.
The entrance into these Black Chambers
by the Chimneys, however narrow and
contorted
they may be, is not very difficult; but
the exit is quite another matter. There are
as many chaotic rocks around the tops of the
Chimneys in the chambers above, as at the
bottom; and it is sometimes no easy task to
find them; the more particularly as there are
dozens of other holes exactly like them,
though leading to nothing. Even the guides
themselves are sometimes for a moment at
fault. Some years since two young
gentlemen
of the West were conducted into the
Black Chambers, whence, in due course of
time, they proposed to return to the Grand
Gallery; a feat, however, as they soon
discovered
to their horror, which it was much
easier to propose than perform. The guide,
who happened not to be very familiar with
this branch of the cave, looked and looked
in vain, for the Chimneys. Not one could he
find. He began to think that while he had
been with the party at the extreme verge of
the Chambers, the rocks must have fallen
down, and sealed up the two passages. Here
was a situation; and, soon there was a scene.
The young gentlemen became frantic; and,
declaring they would sooner die on the spot
than endure their horrible imprisonment
longer
,
condemned to agonize out existence by
inches, they drew their pistolswith which,
like true American travellers, they were both
well providedresolving at once to end the
catastrophe. The only difficulty was a
question
that occurred, whether each should do
execution upon himself by blowing his own
brains out, or whether, devoted to friendship
even in death, each should do that office for
the other. Fortunately, before the difficulty
was settled, the guide stumbled upon one of
the Chimneys, and blood and gunpowder were
both saved.
The danger of being entrapped in these
dens is perhaps as great as ever; but such an
accident can only happen where the guide,
besides being inexperienced, is of a temper to
take alarm, or become confused at an
unexpected
difficulty. In all intricate passages
throughout the cave, and in many that are
not intricate, the rocks are marked with broad
arrows pointing the way out. A piece of
chalkor, to be correct, of decomposing
limestone
caught
up along the way, makes an
intelligible
record on the black rocks of the path;
and explo ers at first, and after them
super-philanthropic
visiters, have taken care these
marks shall be in abundance. The rocks at
the Chimneys have their share of arrows, and
a man with good eyes and a philosophic
temperament
will find little difficulty in making
his way in and out.
In the right-hand wall of the Grand
Gallery
,
directly opposite the Black Chambers, is
the opening of another vault, (whence the
name of Cross Rooms,) called Fox's Hall. It
runs backward, and after a course of four or
five hundred feet, returns to the Grand
Gallery
.
From the Black Chambers to what may be
properly considered the termination of the
Grand Gallery, is a distance of only two or
12*
three hundred yards. During a part of this
space, the path is very narrow, running
between
rudely piled, but high walls of loose
stones, thrown up by the ancient inhabitants,
for a purpose they doubtless understood
themselves
,
though it will not seem very obvious
to the modern visiter. The passage, however,
soon widens again; and presently we hear
the far-off murmur of a waterfall, whose wild
pattering sound, like that of a heavy rain, but
modified almost to music by theringing echoes
of the cave, grows louder as we approach,
and guides us to the end of the Grand
Gallery
.
We find ourselves on the verge of a
steep stony descent, a hollow running across
the cave from right to left, bounded on the
further side by a solid wall extending from
the bottom of the descent up to the roof, in
which it is lost. In the roof, at the right hand
corner are several perforations as big as
hogs-heads
,
from which water is ever fallingon
ordinary occasions, in no great quantities, but
after heavy rains, in torrents, and with a
horrible
roar that shakes the walls, and resounds
afar through the cave. It is at such times
that these cascades are worthy the name of
Cataracts, which they bear. The water
falling
into the hollow below, immediately
vanishes
among the rocks. In fact, this hollow is
the mouth of a great pit, loosely filled in with
stones, which have not even the merit of being
lodged securely. A huge mass of rocks fell,
some years ago, from the little domes of the
cataracts, almost filling that corner of the
hollow; but they speedily crushed their way
down to the original level. On another
occasion
,
some visiters tumbling a big rock into
the hollow on the left hand, the crash set all
below in commotion, causing a considerable
sinking in that quarter.
Over this portion of the hollowthat is,
on the left handhigh up in the wall that
bounds the passage, the visiter dimly
discerns
an opening, behind which, listening
attentively
,
he can hear the pattering of another
cascade. Descending into the hollow and
clambering up a mound of stones by way of
ladder, we make our way into this opening
the Garret-holeand find ourselves
between
two hollowsthe one we have just
crossed, and a secondforming part of a
concealed
chamber of no great extentinto
which, from a barrel-like dome above, falls
the Second Cataract. Opposite to this Second
Cataract, at the bottom of the wall, (which is,
however, some twelve or fifteen feet above
the bottom of the hollow,) is a horizontal
fissure
,
ten or fifteen feet wide, but so low as
only to permit a man lying flat on his face to
enter it. But through that narrow fissure
the Humble Chuteand in that grovelling
position
,
we must pass, if we would visit the
Solitary Cave; a branch only discovered
within
a few years. Indeed, if we can believe the
guide, our little party was the first that ever
entered it; for though the fissure had been
often observed, and it was thought might lead
to a new branch, neither himself nor any
other individual had ever attempted to crawl
through it. It is, in truth, somewhat of a
awe-inspiring
appearance, looking like one of
Milton's
Rifted rocks whose entrance leads to Hell;
though we discovered, to our great
satisfaction
,
that it led to quite another place.
Crawling along on our faces for a hundred
feet or more, we found ourselves at last in
more comfortable quarters, in a cave neither
very wide nor high, nor indeed extensive; the
greatest length of the main passage not
exceeding
seven hundred yards, but curious for
the dens and grotesque figures worn in the
rocks by water, and for its recent stalactites,
of which there is quite a grove in the
chamber
called the Fairy Grotto. The Island
or Boone's Castle, as it is more poetically
calledis a very curious rock supporting the
roof in manner of a pier, but excavated
through and through in several directions, so
as to make a little room, in which you may
sit at ease, looking out into the cave by
sundry
wide, window-like orifices in its walls.
From the main passage run several narrower
branches, some of which have not yet been
explored. In one of them was found a kind
of nest composed of sticks, moss, and leaves,
with, I believe, a walnut or two in it
supposed
to be a rat's nest, floated thither from
some unknown higher branch; and in another
passage was found a tooth resembling a
beaver's. In one of the passages, called the
Coral-grove Branch, is a deep pit, suspected,
upon pretty strong grounds, to have some
underhand kind of communication with the
Cataracts, which are at no great distance;
and, indeed, from an occurrence that
happened
some few months after the discovery of
the Solitary Cave, this communication can
hardly be questioned. One of the younger
guides, at the time mentioned, had conducted
a visiter into the Solitary Cave, where they
employed themselves looking for new
branches
at its extremity. It was a winter's day,
very stormy; and rain was falling, when they
entered the cave. The Cataracts were found
pouring down water rather more freely than
usual, but not in quantities to excite any
alarm; and they crawled through the Humble
Chute, and to the farthest recesses of the
branch, without giving them a thought. In
these remote vaults, as indeed in all others
throughout the cave, except in the immediate
vicinity of falling water, a death-like
silence
perpetually reigns: of course, a sound of
any kind occurring, immediately attracts
attention
,
if it does not cause dismay. I can
well remember the thrilling effect produced
upon myself and companions, when first
exploring
the Solitary Cave, by a low, hollow,
but very distant sound we heard once or
twice repeated, which we supposed was
caused by the falling of rocks in chambers
far beneatha phenomenon, however, as it
seems, of very rare occurrence. The visiter
and his guide, of whom I speak, were startled
from their tranquillity by a more formidable
noisea sudden rumbling and roaring,
distant
indeed, but loud enough to produce
consternation
.
They retraced their steps as
rapidly as they could. The noise increased
as they advanced; and by and by, when they
reached the mouth of the Coral-grove Branch,
which is two hundred yards from the Humble
Chute, they found it full of water, and
pouring
out a flood into the Solitary Cave, here,
at its lowest level. They hurried by,
astounded
and affrighted, yet rejoiced to find the
water was not rushing into the cave through
the Humble Chute, which would have
effectually
cut off their escape. It was no longer
to be doubted that a torrent, a result of the
rains, was now pouring down the Cataracts,
especially the second one, immediately
opposite
the outlet of the Humble Chute; its
terrific
din made that more than evident; and it
was questioned whether the body of falling
water might not fill the narrow passage into
which the Solitary Cave opens, and so
prevent
their further retreat. But the occasion
was pressing; time was too precious to be
wasted in hesitation. The guide crept up
the Chute, and reached its outlet, where he
was saluted by a flood of spray that
immediately
extinguished his torch. He perceived,
however, that the path was still open to the
Garret Hole, which if he could reach, there
was little fear of himself and companion
dying
the death of drowned rats. His torch
proving insufficient to resist the spray and
eddies of air caused by the cascade, he crept
a little back into the Chute, where he
manfully
substituted his shirt for the torch; and
with that flaming in his hands, making a
gallant
rush, he succeeded in reaching the
Garret
Hole; whence, lighting his torch again, it
was afterwards not very difficult to assist in
extricating his companion. The Solitary
Cave was visited again, a few days after: the
floods had then entirely subsided, and the
Cataracts dwindled to their former
insignificance
,
leaving no vestige of the late scene of
disorder and terror.
CHAPTER IX.
THE CHIEF CITYITS MEMORIALSDARKNESS
CAPTAIN B.
Standing
again upon the verge of the
declivity
of the First Cataract, facing toward
the mouth of the cave, we perceive on the
right hand, a wide and lofty passage running
from the Grand Gallery, which we did not
before notice. This is commonly considered
as a continuation of the Grand Gallery, or
Main Cave, and may be followed for a
distance
of fifteen hundred yardsnearly a
mile. Half a mile from its entrance at the
Cataracts, it is crossed by another wide cave,
the right and left hand branches of which are
each half a mile long, and called, respectively,
Symmes's Pit Branch and the Branch of the
Blue Spring. Each has its curiosities and its
VOL. II.13
interest. The end of the former is the
farthest
point from daylight yet reached in
the Mammoth Cave, being but a few yards
short of two miles and a half. The pit from
which it takes its name is of unknown depth,
and peculiarly dangerous to approach; its
funnel-shaped mouth being strown with
loose rocks, that, at a touch of the foot, roll
into the chasm: it is such a trap as the
lion-spider
digs in the sand for his unwary prey,
which a single false step slides headlong into
his expanded jaws.
Into these branches it is not my intention
to drag the reader: it is sufficient if he will
follow me six or seven hundred yards into the
Main Cave. Throughout this distance, the
floor is still rugged; the path runs over fallen
slabs, that rock and clatter under our feet
with incessant dinin some places to such a
degree as to have gained for certain long but
not lofty mounds over which we must pass,
the name of the Clattering Hills.
But to what a chamber this wearisome and
painful road conducts us! We have
expended
our breath, our epithets, our enthusiasm,
upon the smaller glories of the Vestibule and
the Hall of the Black Chambers, and we
have nothing left wherewith to paint the vast
vault into which we have now found our way.
Yet with even a wilderness of fine words at
command, I doubt whether I could convey an
adequate idea of the scene, or of the
impressions
it produces on a spectator's mind. If
the reader will fancy an oval room extremely
regular in figure of the enormous dimensions
of one hundred and fifty yards in length, by
eighty yards wide, (
feet
are here too trifling
for our purpose,) crowned by a dome one
hundred and twenty feet high, and of an oval
shape, corresponding throughout with the
figure of the room, he will have a better idea
of the den and its horrible grandeur, than
could be conveyed by the most laboured
description
.
On the floor, which is actually
two acres
in area, lies a mountain of great
rocksfallen from the dome, and reposing
chiefly against the left wall. From this
mountain
a
pile of ruins such as we have seen
in the Grand Gallerythe chamber derives
its name of the Chief Citya name that I
infinitely prefer to the trivial one of the
Temple
,
under which it figures in Mr. Lee's map.
The great dome above is of a peculiar and
striking appearance, being formed by the
giving away, one after the other, of the great
horizontal strata of rock, the perforation of
each in the ascending series being less in
dimensions than that in the stratum
immediately
below, until the top of all, in place of a
lantern, is closed by a flat oval slab
symmetrically
cut and placed with the figure and axis
of the chamber. This noble dome, as Mr.
Lee justly observes, in passing through,
from one end to the other, appears to follow,
like the sky, in passing from place to place
on the earth. From its height, it could not
be otherwise.
It must not be supposed that all the vast
dimensions of this prodigious chamber can
be embraced by the eye at once. The
darkness
of the rock of which all is composed,
not to speak of the boundless extent of the
chamber, forbids that. It is only by
ascending
the mountain, collecting the pieces of
caneremnants of old Indian torchesand
building fires with them, that we can see any
thing, except a few yards of rocky floor
around us;all else is the void of darkness.
When the fires are in flame, the torches all
freshly trimmed, we can, from the top of the
mountain, discern, dimly it must be confessed,
the dome above us and the opposite wall;
but the ends of the chamber are still veiled
in midnight. It is only when a guide and a
companion are placed one at each end, with
their torches, that the whole immensity of the
scene begins to break upon our minds.
Upon this mountain we will end our
journey
.
It is a favourite place with visiters,
and was a favourite with the Indian
inhabitants
of yore. The interstices of the rocks,
from top to bottom, are full of the half-burnt
remnants of their cane torches: you may, in
any place, collect, in five minutes, fragments
enough to build a fire. HundredsI might
almost say, thousandsof fires have been
already
built by visiters; but the supply of fuel
seems yet inexhaustible. The presence of
these canesthe growth of the river-banks
nearin such astonishing, such
unaccountable
quantities, is all that remains to prove in
what favour the Red-man held the ruins of
the Chief City. Visiters of the pale-faced
race have left still more surprising proofs of
their regard. The chinks of the wall, at the
top of the mountain, are stuck full of written
papers, in which sundry full-hearted
personages
have acquainted the Mammoth Cave
with the state of their affections. Here a
confiding, and, I doubt not, youthful
personage
,
who signs his name in fullit may be
Charles Henry Tender, or Allheart, or any
13*
thing elseassures Miss Lavinia Small,
Peabody,or Pettibones, that he visited the
Mammoth Cave at such a date, and that he
adores her, and will continue to do so as long
as the rocks hold together; there another son
of soul, who writes a good hand, somewhat
the worse for bad paper and mouldered ink,
and spells nothing aright except his own
name, proclaims that he was educated at
such a college, declaring that he will hold his
Alma Mater in honour and affection, and
also Miss Angelina B, diffidently leaving
her
name to be guessed at; then comes
another
edition of Mr. Tender and Miss Small,
under other names, and then another, and
another without endmemorials of fond
hearts and foolish heads.
From these frank confessions, whispered
in pen and ink into the rocky ears of the
Mammoth Cave, and the representations of
the guides, there seems to be every reason
to believe that the Mammoth Caveand
particularly the Chief City thereofhas a
wonderful effect in awakening the tender
passions; a phenomenon which, however
interesting
it might be to discuss, I must leave
to be solved by the philosophers. I felt
somewhat of an inclination, at the first peep
into them, to pocket a brace or two of these
precious records; but they were secrets
breathed in the confessionalofferings made
to the benign (so we must conceive him)
genius of the cave; and I returned them to
their places, to rot and moulder, as perhaps
have already done some of the idle hands
that traced them.
In the Deserted Chambers, we made an
effort, and a successful one, to find out what
solitude
was. Let us, in this fearful vault,
upon this mound of rocks, two miles away
from the blessed light of heaven, prove what
is
darkness;
a thing, I devoutly believe, quite
as little known in the outer world, even as
solitude. Let us blow out our torches. What
should we fear? We have our pockets full
of Lucifers, and `can again our former lights
restore,' whenever it repents us. What,
indeed
,
can
we fear? Man is not with us: we
are alone with God. Is darkness so very
terrible?
He that has light within his own clear breast,
May sit i' the centre, and enjoy bright day.
Puff, puff, puffit is done; the torches are
out, and now we are indeed in darkness. Ah!
that those who dream that Heaven, in
visiting
them with a little affliction, a little
desolation
,
a little gloomthe darkest that was
ever infused into the sparkling dew-drop of
lifehas quenched the light of hope and
happiness
,
leaving the spirit in midnight, should
sit with us upon this rock, and say if such
darkness as
this
ever lay even for a moment
upon the mind! Never: such darkness were
annihilation. It is awful. The atmosphere
is a rock, palpable and solid as the limestone
walls around; the very air seems petrified
condensed into a stratum of coal, in which
we sit encased like toads or insectsfossils
living fossils. Such it is to usto man;
all whose skill exhausted in the most
ingenious
devices, could not collect from it light
enough to see his own fingers. Yet the bat
flutters by at ease; and the rat, which has no
such fine organization as his airy cousin, or
as a
somnambule
from the digits of an
Animal-Magnetizer
creatures,
as we all knowthe
bat and the
somnambule
that see through
their bodies, or, rather, see by instinct,
without
the intervention of visual apparatus of
any kindthe rat scampers over the rocks
with equal facility and confidence; and,
doubtless
,
if a cat were here, she also would find
light enough to make a bold dash at his
ratship
.
But we are in gloomgloom
unparallelled
by any thing in the world. Truly,
indeed, man knows nothing about darkness
there
Alas! none but those to whose eyes
Heaven has denied the blessing of light
altogether
.
The
blind
see such darkness; and
here we can learn (for during a period we
can feel it) the depth and misery of the
privation
.
And now, while thus sitting in gloom
ineffable
,
a secret dread (notwithstanding the
actual assurance we possess of security)
stealing
through our spirits, we can understand
and appreciate the horror of mind which
inevitably
seizes upon men lost in caves, and
deprived of their lights; even when their
reasonif they could listen to that ever
illused
counsellor, the victim and football of
every fitful passiontells them that their
situation is not wholly desperate. Although
no fatal accident has ever happened in the
Mammoth Cave, men have been frequently
lost in it; or, at least, have lost their lights,
and so been left imprisoned in darkness. In
such a case, as proceeding in any direction
in the dark is quite out of the question, all
that is to be done is to sit patiently down,
waiting until relief comes from without; which
will happen as soon as the persons outside
have reason, from your unusual stay, to
suspect
that some such catastrophe has occurred.
This every body who enters the cave knows
well enough, and none better than the guides;
and, one would suppose, such knowledge
would always, in case of accident, preserve
from unmanly terror. The case is, however,
as numerous examples prove, quite
otherwise
;
guide and visiter, the bold man and
the timid, yield alike to apprehension, give
over all as lost, and pass the period of
imprisonment in lamentations and prayers.
It is astonishing, indeed, how vastly devout
some men, who were never devout before,
become, when thus lost in the cave; though,
as might be suspected, the fit of devotion is
of no longer duration than the time of
imprisonment
:
When the devil was sick, the devil a monk would be;
When the devil was well, the devil a monk was he
applies very well to the history of cave
conversions
.
I had the good fortune, when on
my way to the Mammoth Cave some years
ago, in a certain city of the South-West,
to stumble upon a worthy gentleman, who,
among his many virtues public and private,
was not supposed to lay any particular claim to
religious devotion; or if he did, took no great
pains to make it evident: on the contrary, I
heard it very energetically averred by one
who was a proficient in the same
accomplishment
,
that Captain B could swear
harder than any other man on the
Mississippi
.
The Captain ascertaining whither we
were directing our footsteps, congratulated
us upon the pleasures we had in store, and
concluded by informing us that he had visited
the Mammoth Cave himself, and, with his
guide, had been lost in it, remaining in this
condition and in the dark, for eight or nine
hours. Dreadful! my friend and self both
exclaimed: what did you do? Do!
replied
the Captain, with the gravity of a
philosopher
;
all that we could;as soon as
our lights went out, we sat down upon a
rock, and waited until the people came in
and hunted us up. We admired the
Captain's
courage, and went on our way, until
we had arrived within two miles of the
Mammoth
Cave; when a thunder-shower drove us
to seek shelter in a cabin on the way-side.
Here we found a man who had been born
and bred, and lived all his life, within so short
a distance of the cave, without having ever
entered it: in excuse of which unpardonable
deficiency, he told us, he had a brother who
had been in it often enough, had sometimes
officiated as guide, and had once even been
lost in it. He was along with a gentleman
he was guidingCaptain B: perhaps
you know Captain B? said our
hospitable
host, Captain B of . Well,
he was the gentleman with my brother: they
lost their lights, and were kept fast in the
desperate
hole for nine hoursawfully frightened,
too. What! Captain B frightened?
Just as much as my brother: I have heard
my brother tell the story over a hundred
times. They got to praying, both of 'em, as
loud as they could; and my brother says, the
Captain made some of the most beautiful
prayers he ever heard in his life! and he
reckons, if the Captain would take to it, he'd
make a rale tear-cat of a preacher!O
philosophy
!
how potent thou art in an arm-chair,
or at the dinner table!
But we have been long enough in
darkness
,
long enough even in the cave. We
relight
our torches, we bid farewell to the Hall
of the Chief City, and returning to the Grand
Gallery, retrace the long path that leads us
back to daylight.

CHAPTER X.
CONCLUSION.
The
Mammoth Cave possesses few features
of interest for a geologist or naturalist. It
may be considered a great crack opened in
the thick bed of limestone, by some
convulsion
,
or series of convulsions, which have left
it in some places in its original condition,
while, in other parts, it has been worn and
altered by rushing floods that have swept
into it sand, gravel, and clay; while, also, the
infiltration of springs from above has, here
and there, destroyed the calcareous crust,
and exposed the superstratum of sandstone.
The earthquakes, that have left their visible
devastations in every part of the cave, must,
however, have been a thousand times more
violent than those of modern days. Many
shocksthe concussions that succeeded the
great New Madrid earthquake of 1811
were experienced by the nitre-diggers, while
at work in the cave; but, though sorely
frightened on each occasion, they never saw
a single rock shaken from the roof or walls.
The rock contains no fossils, or none that
we could discover; though shells abound in
the limestone in the vicinity. No fossil bones
have been discovered. Human bones in a
recent condition were dug up near the
entrance
;
but no mummies were found. The
mummy in one of the public museums said to
be from the Mammoth Cave, was taken, we
were told, from a cave in the neighbourhood
we believe, the Pit Cave; though deposited
for awhile in the Mammoth Cave for
exhibition
.
There are vast numbers of rats in the
cave, though we never could get sight of any
of them. What they can find to live on may
well be wondered at. In winter, the roof of
the cave, as far in, at least, as the Black
Chambers, where we found them in numbers,
is seen dotted over with bats. In the low
and humid branches, there may frequently be
seen, galloping along over roof and floor, an
insect with long cricket-like legs, and body
like a spider; and a smaller insect, somewhat
like that strange bedfellow, with which
misery makes us acquainted, may be
sometimes
discovered.
I have frequently had occasion to speak of
the Indians, the original
inhabitants
of the
cave; and, indeed, this is to me one of the
most interesting subjects connected with the
Mammoth Cave. I use the word inhabitants;
for mere visiters, unless the cave was, in its
day, much more of a lion among the savage
Red-men than it is now, even among their
white successors, could never have left behind
them so many vestiges. We have seen what
vast quantities of broken, half-burnt canes lie
among the rocks of the Chief City. They
are scattered in other parts of the caveI
might say, throughout the whole extent of the
Grand Galleryin nearly equal profusion.
These, there can be little doubt, are the
remains
of torchesin some cases of fires; for
which former purpose they were tied together
with strips of young hickory bark, into little
faggots. Such faggots are still occasionally
picked up, half-consumed, the thongs still
around them. Besides, there have been
discovered
stone arrow-heads, axes, and
hammers
,
and pieces of pottery, with moccasins,
blankets of woven bark, and other Indian
valuables; in short, evidence sufficient to
prove that these occidental Troglodytes
actually
lived
in the cave. No mere visiters
would have taken the trouble to build the
walls in the Grand Gallery near the
Cataracts
;
much less to clear away the rocks from
the floor of the Blue-Spring Branch, as we
find has been done, so as to make a good
path on the sand beneath. There are, in
several branches, places where the walls have
been picked and beaten with stone-hammers
for what purpose no one can tell; in others,
rocks heaped up into mounds, and the earth
separatedthe object of such labour, as we
cannot suppose the Indians did dig villanous
saltpetre, being equally mysterious; neither
of which could have been done by temporary
visitants. Nor could such visitants have
made themselves so thoroughly acquainted
with the cave; into every nook of which they
seem to have penetrated, leaving the prints
of their moccasins and naked feet in the sand
and clay of the low branches, and fragments
of their cane torches in the upper ones.
Even in the Solitary Cave, previously
unknown
to the guides, we found, in one place,
the print of a naked foot. One would think
14*
the curious fellows had even entered some of
the pits; as there are long ropes, or withes of
hickory bark, sometimes found, which look
as if they might have been prepared for such
a purpose. At all events, it is quite plain
that the Mammoth Cave was once the
dwelling-place
of manof a race of the Anakim,
as some will have it, whose bones were
disinterred
in the Vestibule; or, as
common-sense
personages may believe, of a tribe of
the common family of Red-men, who, in ages
not very remote, occupied all the fertile
valleys
along the rivers of Kentucky. Some
such clan, I suppose, dwelt on Green River,
at Cave Hollow, using the Mammoth Cave
as a kind of winter-wigwam, anda more
common use of caves among Indiansa
burial place. The tribe has vanished, and
their bones, (to what base uses we may
return
!)
converted into gunpowder, have been
employed to wing many a death against their
warring descendants.
But of Indians, charnels, and caves no
more: we have reached the confines of day;
yonder it shines upon us afar, a twinkling
planet, which increases as we advance,
changing from pallid silver to flaming gold.
It is the gleam of sunset playing upon the
grass and mosses at the mouth of the cave.
Oh, World, World! he knows not thy
loveliness
,
who has not lived a day in the
Mammoth
Cave!
THE
BLOODY BROAD-HORN.
CHAPTER I.
WESTERN STEAMBOATSTHE OHIO RIVER.
The
frequency, and dreadful character, of
accidents by steam on the Western waters,
have, among other effects, very generally
induced
the good people of the East to regard
an Ohio or Mississippi steamboat as nothing
better than a floating man-trapa
locomotive
volcano, on which Western ladies and
gentlemen take their seats for the purpose of
being blown into eternity.
After forming such a conception, and
drawing
in his mind a suitable picture of the
infernal-machine
,
in which he is to take his
chance of a visit to the other worlda
picture
of some clumsily constructed hulk,
painted
over with flames and fiery devils, like the
San-benito
of a prisoner of the Inquisition,
perhaps, also, begrimed with the blood of
former
victimsthe traveller is somewhat
astonished
to find himself in a stately and splendidly
appointed barge, that might have served the
need of Cleopatra herself, and which will
certainly
vie with, if it does not entirely surpass
in magnificence, the finest steamers he has
ever floated in, in any other part of the world.
His astonishment will increase, when,
searching
out the commander, whom he expects to
discover picking his teeth with a bowie-knife,
or drinking grog out of a barrel, he lights
upon a very well behaved and companionable
personage, who does the honours of his
vessel
with all courtesy, and declares he never
yet blew up a boat, and never even races,
unless
when his passengers particularly request
it; when he finds the engineer oiling his
pump-rods
,
instead of weighing down the
safety-valve
;
and the pilot industriously sighting his
distances, instead of shooting down strangers
on the shore. In short, after making many
more equally surprising discoveries, he will
at last come to the conclusion that the
occurrence
of accidents in a great many Western
steamboats does not necessarily imply that
accidents must, or even
may
, happen in all;
and that he is, perhaps, as safe and has as
good reason to enjoy himself, during his
voyage
,
as if caged in the quietest low-pressure
on the Delaware.
When a man discovers that he may enjoy
himself, it is a very common consequence that
he will do so. And it is my impression,
confirmed
by repeated enterprises in those
formidable
vessels, that a man may enjoy
himself
to as great, if not to greater advantage
in a Western steamboat than in any other
in the land. One chief reason of this is the
length of the voyage one commonly takes in
the Western boat, whereby travellers have
time to turn about them, to strike up
friendships
with one another, and make the
acquaintance
of the captain and officers, from
whom they may thus glean wayside
anecdotes
and information, not to be gained in
shorter trips. Another reason is the general
frankness of manners which, a characteristic
of the West, all men seem naturally to fall
into, the moment they reach the West. But
perhaps the greatest reason of all will be
found in the peculiar structure of the
Western
boat, which is so planned as to compel
travellers to congregate together in little
squads or knots, instead of in one great
multitude
,
whereby sociableness is in a manner
forced upon them. There is in her no great
gathering-place, like the quarter-deck of an
Eastern steamboat, where passengers huddle
together upon benches, to stare each other
sadly and bashfully in the face; but a great
number of smaller retiring placesthe
boiler-deck
,
the social hall, and, above all, the
galleries, in which little groups of men,
accidentally
met, find no difficulty in forming
themselves into agreeable parties.
If I were to add, that the fact of there
being no place of convocation in a Western
steamboat equally free to the ladies as to the
gentlemen, may be another great reason why
the latter so easily enjoy themselves, I do not
know that I should be guilty of a libel upon
either. The truth is, that men in America,
and especially in the West, are so
egregiously
civil to all womankind, and carry their
courtesy to such excess of painful respect, as
to embarrass both themselves and the fair
objects of their reverence, so that they
reciprocally
act as dampers upon each other;
and I believe, upon observation, that they
are, in general, after being a few moments
together
,
in any general place of assemblage,
as happy to fly each other, as schoolboys to
escape a good aunt who has been stuffing
them with excellent advice, instead of
sugar-plums
.
Of the voyage on the Mississippi I have
spoken in another place. The voyage on the
Ohio is infinitely more agreeable,
La Belle
Rivire
being rich in all those charms of bold
and varied scenery, of which the Father
Water is almost entirely destitute. One is
not here oppressed by a continual succession
of willows and cottonwoods springing from
swampy islands and quagmire shores, and a
horizon
so low as to be ever concealed from the
eye. Beautiful hills, springing here from the
margin of the tide, there rising beyond
cultivated
fields or gleaming towns, track the
course of the Ohio from its springs to its
mouth; and high bluffs, crowned with
majestic
planes, shingled beaches, and lovely
islands, changing and shifting in myrioramic
profusion, present an ever changing series of
prospects, of strongly marked foregrounds
relieved against blue distances, so dear to
the eyes of painters and lovers of the
picturesque
.
Add to this that the Ohio has its
storied
shores, its places of renown, its points to
which we can attach the memories of other
days; and we may imagine what pleasure
awaits the voyager on its bosom, who has
once succeeded, as, in general, he will very
easily do, in throwing aside all fears, and
thoughts, of half-burned boilers and
desperately
weighted safety-valves.
For my own part, I can say that in no
river of the United States do I always more
confidently expect, or more uniformly
experience
,
the enjoyment of a steam excursion,
than on the upper Ohio; and I hold a trip, in
the dull seasonthat is, when the vessels are
not over-crowded with passengersin a neat
little summer boatif a
slow
one, so much
the betterwith a pleasant captain, a
civilized
cook, and good humoured companions
whether the voyage be up or downas
one of the most agreeable expeditions that
can well be taken.
On such an occasion, one is pretty sure of
finding companions both able and willing to
talkmen who possess in an uncommon
degree
the intelligence and powers of
conversation
so general in the West, who know
every man and thing in, and appertaining to,
their own states or districts, and every local
history and anecdote which a curious person
might desire to hear. One may even light,
at such times, upon an old pioneer and
founder
VOL. II.15
of the West, an original colonist of
Kentucky
or Ohio, a contemporary, perhaps, of
Boone and Clark, who, solicited by his junior
fellow-travellers, and warmed as much by
their interest in his conversation, as by his
own stirring recollections, can speak of the
days of the border, of the times and scenes
that tried men's souls, and pour a stream of
forest story, the fresher and more delightful
to his hearers for being thus drunk at the
fountain-head.
It was once my fortune, on such a voyage,
to meet such a story-teller, a venerable old
man who was acquainted with every point of
note on the river, and had descended it more
than forty years before, performing a voyage,
whichat that period, always dangerous
was, in this case, attended with circumstances
peculiarly perilous and dreadful. His story,
interesting in itself, had, moreover, the
additional
merit of being told upon the place of
its occurrence, upon the river whose waters
had been dyed with his own blood and the
blood of many a hapless companion, and at
the very spot which had witnessed its fearful
catastrophe. It was a tale strongly
illustrative
,
and with but few exaggerated features,
of the earlier navigation of the Ohio, when
the unwieldy flat-boat, or
broad-horn
, took
the place of the steamer; when men
inexperienced
in navigation, and entirely
unacquainted
with the river upon which they so
boldly launched, were the only sailors and
pilots; and when, above all, the river-banks
were lined with Indians, lying in wait to
plunder
and murder.
It was a fine evening of early October,
183; the beautiful hills, forest-clad to the
top, had put on their glorious mantles of gold
and scarlet; the clumps of trees on the shores
and islands,some half bared of leaves,
displaying
the tufts of green misletoe on their
branches and the purple ivies draping their
pillared trunks, some still in full leaf and
glowing
,
here like a sunshiny cloud, and there
like a hillock of cinnabarglassed themselves
in a tide as smooth and bright as quicksilver,
in which their reflections, and the images of
bank and hill, were as clear and distinct to
the vision as the objects themselves; so that
we seemed to be rather sailing down a river
of air than any grosser element.
It was an hour whenevery one having
finished his suppertravellers felt
sentimental
and philosophic, and dragged their
chairs to the boiler-deck; wherewith the
consciousness all had, that, in case of a boiler
bursting, they were in the best place in the
boat to be blown to atomseach surveyed
the Eden-like prospects continually arising,
admired, commented, and prepared his store
of anecdote, to take part in the story-telling
conversation, which always formed the
entertainment
of the evening.
It was at this period that the old
gentleman
,
(Mr. Law, he said, was his name,) who
had on previous occasions narrated many
interesting
anecdotes of other persons, without
doing more than hint at his own adventures,
was prevailed upon to speak of himself, of his
own travel's history; which he did with such
unction and effect, at least so far as regarded
myself, that I was never easy afterward
until I had fully committed his story to
writing
.
I have only to regret that I did not
obtain
for it, as thus faithfully recorded, the
proper evidence of authenticity; that is, a
certificate of its accuracy by the narrator,
under his own hand and seal; which would
have settled the doubts of all such skeptical
persons as may be disposed to regard it as a
fiction and coinage of my own imagination.
CHAPTER II.
IN WHICH MR. MICHAEL LAW BEGINS HIS STORY: WITH
SOME ACCOUNT OF COLONEL STORM AND HIS
FAMILY
.
Had
Fulton and Stevens, and the other
great men who have covered the rivers of
America with steamboats,thus began the
narrator,commenced their experiments
twenty years earlier than they did, the
history of the West would have presented
no such tales of blood as I am now about
to relate, and its settlement would have
advanced with equal rapidity and safety.
With a steamboat on the Ohio, to waft us,
the first invaders of the wilderness, upon our
voyage, instead of the wretched broad-horns
in which so many of us went to our deaths,
the voyage to Kentucky would have
presented
15*
none of those dangers and difficulties by
which colonization was so seriously retarded,
and the rich fields of the West left so long in
possession of the savage Red-man.
I was born in Virginia, in what is now
Jefferson county, on the Upper Potomac,
an honourable birth-place; but I cannot boast
a lineage either rich or distinguished. On
the contrary, I found myself, at the age of
eighteen, in the month of March, 1791, an
ignorant younker, (ignorant of every thing
but the rifle, which I had learned to handle in
hunter's style by mere instinct, and the hoe,
the use of which noble implement starvation
and a hard-labouring father had as early
taught me,) set adrift upon the world, to seek
my fortune, or, in other words, shift for
myself
as I could; my father, Michael Law,
(which is also my own name,) having brought
home to his cabin, one fine morning, a new
friend in the person of a step-mother; who
was never at rest until she had succeeded in
driving me from the house; a catastrophe to
which my father the more readily consented,
as I was now, he said, `a man grown, and
full as able to make my way in the world as
he was.'
He gave me his blessing, a knife, a new
shirt, and a pair of shoes, with an old
haversack
to put them in, a dried venison-ham,
(which was, however, of my own shooting,)
and as much parched corn as I chose to
carry
;
and my step-mother adding, as proofs of
her affectionate regard, a pair of stockings
and a worsted nightcap of her own knitting,
I bade them farewell; and, in company with
three other adventurers like myself, turned
my face towards Pittsburg, with the design
of proceeding to Kentucky; where I was told
I might have a fine farm for nothing, save an
occasional fight for it with the Indians, and
plenty of stock, horses and cows, as many as
I might want, from any body for the mere
asking.
Arriving at Pittsburg, then a miserable
little hamlet, in which no wiseacre could
fore-see
the bustling and important city into which
it has now grown, I began to be somewhat
alarmed at the dismal stories every one had
to tell of the terrors of the downward
voyage
,
of the frequent, nay, daily destruction
of boats with all on board, by the Indians;
from whom, many declared, it was a mere
accident
and miracle that any boats should
escape
at all. My companions were even more
dismayed than I, one of them returning home
within a week, and the others hiring
themselves
out at labour upon the fortress, which
the government of the United States was
then constructing at Pittsburg.
As for me, having a little money in my
pocket, won at sundry-shooting matches
during
the preceding winter, and treasured up
against a rainy day, I resolved to play the
gentleman as long as it lasted, and then
determine
upon the course to be pursuedto
go to work like my friends, for which I had
but little appetite, having a soul quite above
my condition, or join some enterprising boat's
crew, and proceed to Kentucky, for which I
still felt a hankering, notwithstanding the
notorious
perils of the voyage.
My money, as I employed it freely, first,
in decorating my person with a much
handsomer
suit of clothes than had ever before
decked it, and, secondly, in establishing
myself
in the best tavern in the place, I soon
managed to make away with; upon which,
having now made up my mind for Kentucky,
I began to look about me for a boat, and the
means of obtaining a passage in it to
Kentucky
.
In this I found no great difficulty. The
great preparations which General St. Clair,
Governor of the Territories Northwest of the
Ohio, and commander of the national forces
in the West, was making at his camp, Fort
Hamilton, the site, as all know, of the
present
Cincinnati, for a great expedition, which,
every body supposed, was to sweep the
Indians
from the face of the earth, and so end
the Indian wars in Kentucky for ever, had
given a vast impulse and increase to
emigration
;
and there was now not a week,indeed,
scarce a day, in which some boat, or fleet of
boats, did not depart from Pittsburg. And
these were seldom so heavily laden, or
strongly
manned, but that room could be readily
found for a single unencumbered man, a
sprightly lad like myself, who could balance
a rifle, had muscles for an oar, and otherwise
promised to make himself serviceable on the
voyage.
It was my good fortune (for such,
notwithstanding
the disasters of the voyage, I
shall always esteem it,) to find, among other
emigrants who were making their
preparations
for descending the river, a certain
Colonel
Storm, a worthy old gentleman of
Virginia
,
who had fought through the French
Wars and the Revolution at the head of a
regiment of Buckskins, and bore the
reputation
of a brave officer, as well as a rich man.
He was on his way to Kentucky, to locate
bounty-grants
of his own, as well as others
belonging
to brother officers, for whom he acted as
agent; and he intended also to settle in
Kentucky
;
for which purpose, he had brought with
him his familyconsisting, however, of but a
single daughter, a beautiful and amiable girl
of seventeenand a great deal of property,
horses, cattle, furniture and farming
implements
,
and a dozen or more slaves, enough in
all to fill two or three boats of the ordinary
kind.
With such a property at stake, and so
many things to encumber him on the voyage,
he was desirous to enlist the services of as
many bold assistants as he could procure,
and therefore offered, besides a free passage
and support, a considerable bounty to such
persons as would take service with him for
the expedition.
Hearing of this, and that he had nearly
completed his crews, and expected to put off
in a very few days, I went to him forthwith,
to offer my services, and was immediately
ushered into his presence. He was a fine
portly, powdered, and military-looking old
gentleman, but, as I soon saw, hot and
irascible
of complexion, his temper being especially
soured at the time of my visit, by a fit of the
gout, which had suddenly fastened upon one
of his legs; and as I entered the room, I heard
him scolding very bitterly at a young man,
who seemed to be his clerk or secretary, and
was busy among books and papers, which he
tumbled over in a hurried and confused
manner
,
as if irritated by the Colonel's remarks,
and yet struggling to keep down his anger
without reply.
The old gentleman seeing me,
demanded
very sharply, `who I was, and what I
wanted?'
I told him, `I came to enter with him for
the Kentucky voyage;' upon which he gave
me a stare of contempt, and angrily
exclaimed
,`What!
with that tailor's finery
on your back?' (for I had my best suit on:)
`Oons and death, I want men, not coxcombs!
Men
, you jackdaw! men that can stare death
in the face, and take the devil by the
top-knot
!'
I told him, being somewhat galled by his
contemptuous expressions, that `I was man
enough for his purpose, or any body else's;' at
which he burst into a passion, swore at me
for `an insolent hobnail,' and concluded the
angry tirade by asking me `what I was good
for? and what I could do?'
`Any thing,' replied I, as stiffly as a lord,
`any thing that any other man can do.'
`Oh, ay, I doubt not!' said he, ironically,
and grinning over his shoulder at the young
man, his clerk, `you can read novels, and
write verses, and play the fiddle, and dangle
after the women, eh?' and he darted another
bitter glance at the young fellow, who put
his hand up to his head, and twisted it among
his hair, looking very much incensed, but
still made no reply.
`I can read,' said I, and with great truth
and honesty, `very well in the Testament,
and any other book with big print: and I can
write, too, right smart; only my master never
put me in small-hand.' At which answer,
Colonel Storm burst into a laugh; which I
mistook for a laugh of incredulity, and
therefore
hastened to assure him I spoke nothing
but the truth; adding, which I did with great
frankness, that `as for the fiddle, I knew
nothing about it, having never tried my hand
at any thing better than a banjo. But as for the
women,' I said, with equal honesty, `though
I don't know any thing about dangling,
I reckon I can kiss a pretty girl as well as
any body.'
`Well,' said Colonel Storm, fetching
another laugh, and then giving me a second
diabolical grin, which, I believe, was owing
to a sudden twinge in his foot, `that's neither
here nor there. What can you do that's
like a
man?
for there's the point to be
considered
?
`I can draw a good bead upon a rifle,' I
replied; upon which the Colonel roared, with
approbation, `Now you talk like a man, and
not a jackass!' `Yes, sir,' I continued,
swelling
with a sense of my importance and
superior skill in an exercise which, I
perceived
,
he regarded as a merit; `I can't
pretend
to be any great shakes at the reading,
and writing, and fiddling; but I can go the
Old Sinner on a cut-bore, kill death at a knife
fight, and out-wrestle any man of my inches
this side the Alleghany!' All which was,
perhaps, more than half true; for in those,
my cubling days, I was, I am sorry to say,
something of what we, now-a-days, call `a
young screamer.'
`Bravo!' cried Colonel Storm, turning
maliciously to the young secretary; `do you
hear that, Tom Connor? Here's a young
VOL. II.16
fellow can shoot, and fight, and do other
things a man can; and not a bit of reading,
and writing and fiddling, and
woman-dangling
does he care for. Oons, sir, I thought I
should have made a man of you!'
The young fellow, Connor, as the Colonel
called him, started up, as if stung by the old
man's remark, and, I believe, was about to
make some passionate rely; but just then the
Colonel's daughter came into the room, with
some drug-stuff in a cup she had brought her
father, and Connor instantly resumed his
seat, busying himself among the papers.
The young lady remained in the room
but a few moments; but I had time to observe
she was what I called herthat is, a very
beautiful girl, whose charms and elegance,
such as I had never before seen equalled among
the women of our rude border country,
almost
struck me dumb with admiration. I saw
her look very earnestly, as she passed his chair,
at the young secretary, who, however, kept
his eyes sullenly fixed on his papers; a
circumstance
which appeared to me to displease
the young lady, who drew herself up and
proceeded to her father, to whom she
presented
the cup, which, with sundry wry faces,
he swallowed; and then giving her a kiss, and
calling her `his dear Alicia,' he dismissed her
from the apartment.
The old gentleman now gave me to
understand
that he accepted my services, bade
me write my name on a book before the
secretary
,
whom he ordered to advance me a
sum of money, being a part of his bounty,
which Connor immediately did; and I found
myself enlisted, for such was the term the old
soldier applied to the engagement, in his `
private
broad-horn service,'so Colonel Storm
called it,to be attached to Boat No. 1, in
the capacity of rifleman, oarsman, and, indeed,
all other capacities, as might be necessary. I
was ordered to present myself at the boat on
the following morning, and hold myself in
readiness to depart within two days, and then
took my leave.
While I was leaving the room, there
entered
a gentleman, with whose appearance I
was very much struck. He was a tall, elegant
man, thirty years old, wore a half-military
suit of clothes, finely made, had bright eyes,
and long black hair, which he wore without
powder, and, in short, had every air of a
gallant
soldier and distinguished gentleman. I
heard Colonel Storm, who received him with
much warmth and cordiality, though grinning
at the moment under a paroxysm of pain,
salute
him by the name of Captain Sharpe; and
I observed that while he bowed, which he did
very politely in passing, to Connor the
secretary
,
the latter, though he bent his head in
return, gave him a look as black as midnight.
It was evident he was no friend of Connor,
or Connor no friend of him.
CHAPTER III.
THE STORY OF MICHAEL LAW CONTINUEDA
BORDER
BALL, AND AN INCIDENT.
These
things, which I mention so
particularly
now, because they have an intimate
connection with my story, struck me with
some interest at the time. And having,
besides
,
a natural curiosity to know something
of the individuals who were to be my
companions
in the voyage, I made inquiries
concerning
them of sundry persons better
acquainted
with their history than myself, though
without acquiring much more than I already
knew.
The young man, Connor, I learned, was
a dependant and protg of the Colonel, a
son of a poor soldier,for his origin was no
higher,who had, in some way or other,
16*
managed to lose his life in saving that of the
Colonel. The latter, from gratitude to his
preserver, extended his protection to the
soldier's
boy, whom he had reared up and
educated
in his own house, and almost adopted
as his own child. I was assured, he always
had been, and was still, a great favourite with
the old gentleman, who was extremely fond
of him; but then the Colonel was a whimsical
and violent tempered man, and the gout had,
of late, made him a hundred times more
wayward and irascible than ever, so that it
was scarce possible for any one about him,
but his own daughter, to endure his furious
attacks of ill-humour. Connor was, from his
position continually near his person, more
exposed to suffer from his wrath than others;
but Connor had arrived at an age, when,
beginning
to be conscious of his dependant
condition
,
he was naturally the more intolerant
of unkindness. The Colonel had twitted him
in my presence with certain effeminate
propensities
,
a love of books, music, female
society, &c., and neglect of all manly
accomplishments
;
which the young man must have
felt as the more unreasonable, since it was
represented that the Colonel had himself, by
scarce ever allowing the favourite out of his
sight, prevented his acquiring the active
habits he commended, and compelled him into
those effeminate ones which he condemned.
But with all the scolding and fault-finding
he was forced to endure, I was assured,
Connor
was as much beloved as ever, and that
there was more than a probability the Colonel
would, some day, prove his affection by
making
him his son in reality,that is, by giving
him his fair daughter Alicia to wife.
Of Captain Sharpe, all I could learn was,
that he was a very gallant officer, a South
Carolinian, and son of an old military friend
and brother-in-arms of Colonel Storm, who
had stumbled upon him by accident in
Pittsburg
,
and received him to his friendship as a
worthy son of his old comrade. What had
brought such a fine gentleman as Captain
Sharpe to the frontier did not so clearly
appear
;
though some said it was because of an
unfortunate duel with a brother officer, which,
being of very recent occurrence, had
compelled
the surviver to banish himself for a
time from society and the world. I must
confess, that I heard some uncharitable
persons
hint a suspicion that Captain Sharpe
was not in all respects the honourable and
exemplary personage his fine appearance
seemed to show; and of this opinion, it
appeared
,
was young Connor, the secretary,
who, I was informed, had got himself into a
difficulty with his hot-headed protector, by
acquainting the latter with his suspicions;
for, it seemed, the veteran had been
captivated
by the soldier, `a man,' as he called
him, `after his own heart,' and would endure
no imputations against his honour, however,
to appearance, reasonable and just. Of this
I had myself, after a time, very good proof,
as I shall presently relate.
Having thus obtained all the information
to be then acquired, and visited the Colonel's
boats, to make the acquaintance of my fellow
engags
, my affairs settled, and some money
again in my pocket, I turned about, like a
lad of spirit, to see how I could spend my
few days of liberty to the best advantage.
It happened that a ball, got up by the
garrison
officers and others, the gentry of the
town, was to take place that night; and to
this, being blessed with an equal stock of
simplicity and assurance, I resolved to go,
not having the least suspicion that my
appearance
there could involve any
impropriety
.
With a good coat on my back, I felt
myself equal to any body; and my border
breeding had taught me but little of the
distinctions
of society.
To the ball I accordingly went; and, as
it was held in the big room of a hotel, was
by no means managed with the tender
solicitude
to keep out intruders that now prevails
at such entertainments, and exhibited among
its highly miscellaneous assemblage many
individuals
not a whit more genteelly dressed
than myself, I neither found difficulty in
making
my way into the room, nor, for a long
time, of maintaining my position in it.
I must confess, that I was at first rather
daunted by the appearance of the company,
so much finer, notwithstanding an occasional
departure from elegance, than any I had ever
seen before; the dashing looks of the officers
in their uniforms, of young civilians with
powdered
heads and velvet breeches, and, above
all, of the ladies arrayed in their silks and
satins, their plumes, and ribands, and laces;
and the fine music, for such it appeared to me,
made by a military band, added to some half
a dozen fiddles, had also its effects in
abashing
and embarrassing me; and had any body
at that moment made objection to my
intrusion
,
I have no doubt I should have sneaked
quietly out of the room, conscious, for the
first time, that I had stumbled into society
quite above my condition.
But no one noticed me, and my
embarrassment
began gradually to wear away; and
besides, I fell upon a means of recruiting my
courage in a still more expeditious and
effectual
way. I observed that many of the
gentlemen
dancers, after handing the usual
ball-room
refreshments to their partners, turned
up their own noses at themthat is, not at
their partners, but the refreshmentsand
slyly slipped down stairs to the bar of the
hotel, where more manly refreshments were
to be had. Perceiving this, and not knowing
what I could better do than imitate my
betters
,
I slipped down likewise, and, sorry I am
to say, not once only, but several times; so
that, in the end, my modesty took to itself
wings, and I found myself as bold as a lion
and happy as a lord; in short, entirely beside
myself. It must be recollected, that I was a
young and ignorant booby, who, besides being
just let loose upon the world, and therefore
incapable of taking care of myself, possessed
a brain none of the strongest for resisting
generous liquors.
My first glass infused such courage into
my veins, that I was able to look boldly
around me upon the assembly, here giving a
gentleman a stiff look, and there staring a
lady out of countenance. While thus
engaged
,
my eyes fell by chance upon my
employer's
daughter, the fair Alicia, who, it
seemed, was present, and, indeed, was
considered
the great beauty of the ball. She was
about to dance a minuet, and, as it proved,
with Captain Sharpe, who led her into the
middle of the room; where space was
immediately
made for them, the company
clustering
eagerly around, as if expecting to witness
an uncommon display of elegant dancing.
Nor were they deceived. I had never before
seen such a dance as a minuet; the measures
which I had learned to tread being confined
to jigs and reels, and the still more primitive
double-shuffle. I saw a minuet, therefore,
for the first time, and, as it happened, danced
by as superb a pair of creatures as ever
trode a ball-room floor, or walked through
the mazes of that dance, the most dignified
and beautiful ever invented. Every body
was in raptures at the spectacle, and when
the dance was over, many clapped their
hands, and cried
Bravo
and
Brava;
while I
myself, being as much intoxicated with
delight
as the rest, cried aloud, `Hurrah for
pretty-toes!' (meaning the fair Alicia,) `go it
ag'in for God's sake!' It was fortunate that
the plaudits of the company, which were loud
and numerous, drowned my voice, and so
prevented the compliment outraging the ears
of the beautiful dancer, or, indeed, reaching
those of any other person.
After this, I frequently observed the
Colonel's daughter, who was, during the
whole evening, so closely besieged by
Captain
Sharpe, that no one else seemed able to
approach her; and I thought to myself, thinks
I, `if we don't get them boats off in no time,
the sodger will have the gal from the
secretary
,
or there an't no moonshine.' Verily,
the Captain seemed pleased with the lady,
and the lady with the Captain.
It was no very long time after this that
I reached that grand acme of courage of
which I have spoken; and being tired of
playing
the looker-on, I resolved to have a dance
as well as my betters. So, having paid
another visit to the bar, I returned to the
ball-room to select a partner; and, as the
Old Imp, the father of impudence, would have
it, who so proper to serve my turn as the
queen of the ball, the lovely Alicia. I can't
pretend to recollect what were precisely the
thoughts and feelings which at that moment
crowded my conceited noddle; but, I believe,
I had a kind of impression that,from
having
seen her, during the audience with her
father,I had quite a right to claim her
acquaintance. At all events, I remember
well enough, that I marched up to her, and
making a bow and scrape, that unfortunately
swept a lieutenant of infantry off his legs,
besides some damage done to the skirts of a
lady's dress, `begged to ax the honour to go
a jig with her.' She started up, looking as
proud and haughty as a peacock, and gave
me such a bitter stare as I never thought
could come from such amiable eyes. I felt
quite incensed at her, thinking myself
insulted
;
and no doubt should have told her so;
had not a great confusion suddenly arisen
among the gentlemen, some of whom asked
`who the drunken scoundrel was, and how
he got in?' while others swore `I was a
rascally
boatman,' and `must be kicked out.'
A tall officer, with two epaulettes on, seized
me by the shoulders, to hustle me out;
whereupon I knocked him down;a favour
that was repaid with interest by half a dozen
others, who fell upon me, amidst a confusion
of shrieks from the women and outcries from
VOL. II.17
the men; which is the last I recollect of the
adventure; for what with kicks and cuffs, of
which I received an abundance, and a tumble
down the stairs, that terminated the
controversy
,
I was soon deprived of all sense and
remembrance.
CHAPTER IV.
NO MAN A HERO TO HIS OWN VALET-DE-CHAMBRE.
I RECEIVED, in short, a terrible drubbing,
which was doubtless no more than I merited,
though more than I afterwards found
agreeable
.
I did not entirely and satisfactorily, indeed,
recover my wits until the next day, when I
found myself in bed, where I had been
deposited
by some good-natured souls, and from
which it was more than a week before I found
myself able to rise againso soundly and
thoroughly
had I been threshed for my
impertinence
.
Nor do I believe I should have
escaped so soon, had it not been for young
Connor, the Secretary, who, with all his
faults, was a very kind and humane youth;
and, although I had no more claim upon him
than I derived from being in the service of
his patron, was very attentive in visiting me
and administering to my wants, during the
time that I lay sick and suffering, and
neglected
by every body else. His goodness
made a strong impression upon my feelings,
and I swore I would requite it with my
life-blood, if necessary. In truth, it gained
my heart entirely. I learned from hima
piece of information which was the more
agreeable to me, as I feared my misfortune
would cause me to lose my commission in
the broad-horn servicethat there was no
fear of my being left behind, the voyage
having been put off for a time in consequence
of my commander's sickness, Colonel Storm
being laid upon his back like me, but laid by
a different causethat is, by a new fit of the
gout. And, indeed, I was entirely restored
before he recovered sufficiently to begin the
voyage; which was not until two weeks after
the day of my enlistment.
In the mean while, I found myself a second
time with leisure on my hands, and as much
disposition as ever to enjoy it. I made
several
new friends, whom, however, warned
by past experience, I did not seek for in a
ball-room, nor among those elegant
personages
,
who, I began to perceive, were, or were
resolved to consider themselves, my superiors.
At the start, I felt disposed to ask the
friendship
of the gallant Captain Sharpe; I was
now content to swear everlasting friendship
with the Captain's mana scoundrelly fellow,
who met my advances with extreme
cordiality
,
and immediately gambled me out of all
my money.
This worthy individual, who had been a
soldier, like his mastera deserter from a
British regiment in the revolutionthe
evening
before the broad-horns got under way,
treated me to a supper and a bowl of punch;
in the course of which he acquainted me with
sundry interesting particulars in relation to
his master and himself, of which I had been
before entirely ignorant. And, first, he gave
me to understand, that his master, Captain
Sharpe, had volunteered his agreeable society
and valiant assistance to my employer,
Colonel
Storm, in the voyage to Kentucky, having
resolved to sail with us, out of pure regard
for the Colonel, his father's friend; and,
secondly
,
that he himself, Samuel Jones, the
servant, could not countenance his master in
any such doings, having a great aversion to
Indians, and especially to Indians armed with
tomahawks and scalping-knives. In brief, I
17*
found Mr. Samuel Jones was in great dread
of the perils of the voyage, which feeling he
did all he could to infuse into my own mind.
He had picked up every story, true and false,
that was told of Indian atrocities committed
on the Ohio; and to these he added legends
of spectres, devils, and other sepernatural
agents, by whom the voyager was often
haunted and harassed, and, in spite of
himself
,
driven into the hands of the savages.
Thus, he had a story of a phantom warrior
in a canoe, (supposed to be the ghost of old
Bald Eagle, the Delaware Chief, whose
mangled
corse, set afloat by his murderer, forms
a well-known and ghastfully picturesque
incident
in border history,) who dogged the
boats of emigrants, and by the mere terror
of his presence, drove them into the ambush
prepared by his living countrymen; and
another
legend of a still more frightful spectre,
a gory refugee, who, when the navigators
slept, stole into their boats, and with their
own oars, rowed them silently ashore, into
the midst of their watchful enemies.
These strange stories, which had, I
confess
,
the effect of renewing my alarms to a
certain extent, I remembered the more
readily
as I found they had made their way
among my fellow-voyagers, and were
afterwards
recalled to my mind by events that
occurred during the descent.
Mr. Samuel Jones, having opened his
heart by repeated applications to the bowl,
did not refuse to carry his confidence still
further; and he told me many curious things
concerning his master and other persons,
including
his excellent self, to which I should
have perhaps attached more importance, had
I not supposed the punch had made him
poetical
.
He told me what I then considered
a very preposterous story about his master;
namely, that this exemplary gentleman and
soldier, having broken his father's heart by
evil courses, and abandoned, after meanly
plundering of her property, a deserving but
unhappy wife, (for, Jones assured me, his
master was married,) had finished his
villanies
by debauching the wife of his best friend,
and blowing out the husband's brains by way
of reparation; to which latter exploits he
owed his sudden exile to the back woods, a
further residence in a civilized community
having been thus rendered impossible.
This account, I repeat, I considered a
mere invention of Mr. Jones. And in this
opinion I was confirmed by his telling me
sundry stories concerning himself, which, had
I believed them, would have proved him as
thorough a rogue as his master. My
incredulity
,
however, I soon found, was, in this
latter particular, wholly misplaced; for Mr.
Jones, who was so unwilling to dare the
perils of the Ohio voyage, it was early next
morning discovered, had left his master's
service some time during the night, having
previously taken the precaution to rob the
gallant soldier of every valuable he
possessed
.
The only inconvenience resulting from
this was, that Captain Sharpe was compelled
to borrow all my generous employer's loose
cash, to refit for the voyage, having no leisure
left to look after the robber. Indeed, within
an hour after the discovery of his loss was
madethat is, at sunrise that morning, the
26th of Aprilwe unmoored our boats and
were soon afloat upon the bosom of the Ohio.
CHAPTER V.
THE VOYAGE BEGUN.
Our
flotilla consisted of three boats, two
of them of very large size, and somewhat
overburthened with goods and cattle. That
in which I was stationed, being the flag-ship,
in which Colonel Storm commanded in
person
,
was somewhat smaller than the others,
not so heavily laden, and in all respects
better
fitted outa superiority which it
doubtless
owed to the presence of the fair Alicia,
his daughter. It contained, besides the usual
cabin for the shelter of the crew, a smaller
one set apart for the use of the Colonel's
daughtera sanctuary which none had the
privilege of entering, save the commander
himself, the lady's female attendants, and,
sometimes, the gallant Captain Sharpe. The
horses were divided between the larger boats;
in fact, every thing on board of the
commander's
boat seemed to have been arranged
with a view to detract as little as possible from
his daughter's comfort. The very crew
seemed to have been selected with an eye to
her approbation, consisting, besides four of
the Colonel's oldest and most faithful negroes,
of ten men, the soberest and best behaved of
all his
engags
. There were nineteen souls
in all on board the boatColonel Storm, his
daughter and two female servants, Captain
Sharpe, and the fourteen men as above
mentioned
.
I was surprised, and somewhat
disconcerted
,
to find that my friend Connor was not
in the Colonel's boat; but reflecting that the
latter had not yet entirely recovered from his
gout, and was, indeed, as fretful and irascible
as man could be, I thought in my heart
that the younker had shown his good sense
by entering, as I did not doubt he had done,
one of the other boats. What was my
astonishment
to learn, which I did towards the
close of the day, that Connor was not with
the party at allthat he had left the
Colonel's
servicenay, that he had been
ignominiously
driven from it, in consequence of a
rupture with his patron on the preceding day.
This I learned from some of the men whom
I heard whispering the matter over among
themselves, but who were too little informed
on the subject to be able to acquaint me with
all the particulars. It seemed, however, that
the quarrel had, in some way, grown out of a
dispute the secretary had had with Captain
Sharpe, in the course of which swords had
been drawn between them; though what had
so embittered these doughty champions
against one another, no one pretended to
say. All the men knew was, that the blame
was thrown upon Connorthat Colonel
Storm had taken part against him, and
immediately
turned him adrift; since which,
nothing
had been heard of him by any of the
party.
This intelligence filled me with concern;
and such was my affection for the young man,
who I was sure (without knowing any thing
about it) had been harshly and unjustly treated
that I was, for a time, more than half inclined
to jump ashore, and return to Pittsburg, for the
purpose of seeking him out and offering him
my services. But, having mentioned the design
to some of my comrades, they gave me so
dismal an account of the difficulties and
dangers
from Indians, which, even at so short a
distance from Pittsburg, I should encounter
in making my way along the river, that I was
frighted out of my purpose, and determined,
although reluctantly to remain where I was.
As the young man's misadventure arose
from his quarrel with Captain Sharpe, I
contracted
,
from that moment, a strong dislike to
the latter, who, it appeared to me, had ousted
Connor, only to step into his shoesto take
his
place in the affections of the grum old
Colonel, and, for aught I could tell, in those
of his daughter too. I still could not give
my belief to the stories told me of Captain
Sharpe by his servant; it seemed impossible
such things should be true of so elegant a
gentleman. Nevertheless, I bore them in mind,
resolved, if it should appear that Captain
Sharpe was actually making love to the fair
Alicia, to make her parent fully acquainted
with them.
In this, I must confess, I had in view the
mortification of Captain Sharpe, rather than
the advantage of the Colonel's daughter, for
whom I felt, at first, no very friendly regard.
I remembered her haughty and scornful looks
at the ball, which I had not yet entirely
forgiven
;
and my disgrace and discomfiture on
that occasion, I considered as entirely owing
to her. Besides, as I was now conscious of
the distance fate had placed between us, I
was, at the beginning of the voyage, in
continual
fear, lest she should recognise me and
make me the butt of her ridicule; an
apprehension
,
however, I soon ceased to entertain,
being satisfied she had quite forgotten me.
I will here add, that my dislike to the
young lady wore, of itself, rapidly away; for,
first, it was impossible I should indulge ill will
against a creature so young and lovely; and,
secondly, I perceived there was something on
her mind that rendered her unhappy
something
made visible on her face by a sadness
that seemed to me to grow deeper day by
day. I fancied the cause might be regret for
the absence and misfortunes of Connor; a
conceit that wonderfully raised her in my
esteem
.
It happened, at the time when we began
our voyage, that the river had fallen for the
season unusually low; so that some of the
knowing persons in Pittsburg, considering the
size and weight of the Colonel's boats, had
advised him to wait for a rise of the waters;
a piece of advice of which he took no notice,
though other emigrants who were ready
VOL. II.18
to depart, postponed their voyage
accordingly
.
We were not long in discovering that
we gained little but trouble by being in a
hurry; for, besides that we got along but
slowly
,
and with hard rowing, in consequence of
the gentle current, we were perpetually driving
aground, some one boat or the other, upon
bars, and sandbanks, from which it was a
work of time and labour to escape. Indeed,
one of the boats we found it impossible to
get from a bar, on which she had grounded
some dozen miles or so above Wheeling; and
as, from her proximity to this settlement, and
her position in the middle of the river, it was
not thought she was in any danger from the
savages, the crew consented to remain in her,
waiting for a flood, and also for the fleet it
was expected to bring down from Pittsburg,
with which they were to descend the river.
We of the other boats, sick of our labours at
the oar, rather envied the happy dogs whom
we left taking their ease on the bar, with the
prospect, in a few days, of resuming their
voyage, borne along by the swelling current,
without any toil of their own: nevertheless
these happy personages, as we afterwards
discovered, were, two nights after we left
them, set upon by savages where they lay;
and not one of them escaped to tell the story
of their fate.
Nor was that our only loss. Two nights
afterperhaps at the very moment when our
friends of the stranded boat were dying under
the axes of their Indian assailantsthe
remaining
large boat ran upon a snag, by which
she was rendered a complete wreck, and we
were compelled to abandon her. It was only
by the greatest exertions we were so
fortunate
as to rescue the more valuable portions
of her cargo, including two of the Colonel's
finest horses, which we succeeded in
transferring
to our own boat: the others we left to
their fate, after knocking away the side of
the boat, and driving them into the river,
whence they all swam to the shore, and
doubtless soon found Indian masters. The
crew, consisting of thirteen persons, was
added
to our own, which was thus increased to
thirty-two soulsa number so greatly
disproportioned
to the size of our boat, that they
were not received without the greatest
inconvenience
.
But this we cared for the less, as
we expected soon to reach the new settlement
of Marietta, at the mouth of the Muskingum,
where it was intended to put some of our
superfluous
men ashore, to wait for the boat
we had left behind.
We reached Marietta the next day, and
got rid of eight of the wrecked crew,
retaining
five, of whom two were slaves belonging
to our commander in chief, the others
engag
s
.
Remaining at Marietta during the night,
we set out next morning under what might
have been considered favourable auspices.
The most important of these was a sudden
swell of the river, which rose several feet
in the night, and was still rapidly rising,
when we cast off from the shore. We had
thus a prospect of making our way by the
mere force of the current, and so escaping,
for the remainder of the voyage, the drudgery
of the oar; besides clearing all rifts and
sandbars
,
of which we had already had experience
more than enough. We set out, moreover,
with such a crew as might be supposed to
secure us a perfect exemption from Indian
attacksthirteen
engags
, all well armed,
and acquainted with arms, though no more
than one of them had ever faced an Indian
in battle; together with five able-bodied
negro
men, whom the Colonel had provided
with muskets, and who could doubtless use
them after some fashion; not to speak of the
Colonel himself, who was too gouty for active
service, and Captain Sharpe, who, we had
no doubt, would fight when the time came,
though, at present, as it appeared, more
earnestly bent upon making himself
agreeable
to the commander's daughter than upon
preparing for war.
With a military commander on board,
(though sorely incapacitated for command,)
it may be supposed, our forces were
organized
upon somewhat a military foundation.
We were, at least divided into watches, each
of which under its captain, appointed by
Colonel
Storm, had its regular turn of duty, both
by day and by night.
18*
CHAPTER VI.
THE PHANTOM CANOE.
These
circumstancesthe swell of the
river and our undoubted strengthremoved
from the breasts of many the effects of an
unfavourable occurrence, of which I have not
yet spoken. It will be remembered, that
honest
master Jones had informed me of the
river being haunted by a spectral Indian in a
canoe, whose appearance was the forerunner,
if not the cause, of disaster; and that our
boatmen had also been made acquainted with
the legend. The night before we reached
Marietta, such a spectre was seen, and seen
by all on boardthat is to say, a canoe with
a human shape in it, dogging us at a
considerable
distance behind, and dogging us all night
long. The watch, at first surprised, and then
alarmed, woke up their sleeping companions;
and, as I said, all on board saw it, though all
were not, perhaps, of the same opinion in
regard
to its character. The superstitious
declared
it could be nothing less than the
phantom
of which so much had been told: while
even those who denied its spectral nature,
could explain the phenomenon only by
supposing
it was the boat of some Indian spy,
whose cut-throat companions were lying in
wait somewhere nigh at hand.
Captain Sharpe, to whom we commonly
looked as our acting commander, (Colonel
Storm being seldom able to come on deck,)
upon being called up, laughed at us for a pack
of `cowardly noodles,' as he very politely
called us, declared we saw nothing but a
floating
log, or at best, a drift canoecertainly,
he vowed `there was no man in it'and
ordered
us to back oars a little, to let it float
by. Unfortunately for the Captain's
explanation
,
the moment the broad-horn ceased to
move, that moment the canoe, also, became
stationary; and some of us swore we could
hear the dip of the paddle by which it was
brought to a stand and made to stem the
current
.
`Ghost or no ghost,' said Captain
Sharpe, dryly enough, `it can do us no harm,
so long as it keeps at a distance. If it
comes nearer, hail it; and if it make no
answer
,
let it have a taste of your rifles.' With
these words, and a desperate yawn, that cut
the last word in two, and kept it some forty
seconds in the utterance, the gallant soldier
went down to his mattress, treating the ghost
with a degree of contempt nobody else could
summon to his assistance. The ghostfor
so the majority were resolved to consider the
appearancewas well watched during the
night: it kept at a highly respectful distance,
and at, or before daylight, it suddenly
vanished
away.
The night after we left Marietta, which
was very dark and cloudy, the phantom again
appeared, and caused as much discussion, and,
among some, as much alarm as before; the
more so, perhaps, as, when first discovered,
it was found to be much nearer to us than on
the former occasion; a degree of audacity
which those on deck, the men of the second
watch, rewarded by a volley of rifle-bullets,
according to Captain Sharpe's instructions;
forgetting, however, the important
preliminary
of hailing the mysterious voyager. The
effect of the volley was very happy, as boat
and boatman instantly vanished from view,
and were no more seen: for which reason no
one, not even Captain Sharpe himself, found
fault with the men for only half obeying his
orders.
The disappearance of the phantom
restored
us all to good humour; and, conscious
now of our strength, conscious, too, of our
security on the top of the flood, by which we
were so rapidly borne upon our voyage, with
no necessity before us except that of keeping
our boat in the centre of the river, and so
out of all danger of Indian bullets from the
shore, we began to laugh at past terrors, and
assure each other that the voyage to
Kentucky
was by no means the dreadful thing it
was represented to be.
From this state of things it is not
surprising
there resulted a certain degree of
carelessness among the men in the
night-watches
;
who, feeling that the hand at the
steering-oar could perform all the duty
supposed
to be requisite to their safetythat is,
of keeping the boat in the mid-channelvery
frequently took advantage of the watch-hours
to throw themselves on the deck and steal a
pleasanter nap than could be enjoyed in the
crowded cabin below. And this kind of
watching
,
I confess, on two or three occasions, I
practised with great satisfaction myself.
CHAPTER VII.
DOMESTIC AFFAIRS IN THE BROAD-HORN.
In
due course of time, and without
further
accident, we arrived at the little French
settlement of Gallipolis; which, being the last
upon the river before reaching the Kentucky
settlements, was always a stopping-place,
where the emigrant obtained fresh stores of
provisions, perhaps; but, certainly, the last
news of Indian knaveries on the river below.
At this place, it was resolved to remain for
a day and night, in the hope of being joined
by our stranded boat. The time was passed
by all attached to the broad-horn in such
frolics and diversions ashore as suited their
several humours. Even the fair Alicia, who,
by this time, was growing visibly thin and
palea misfortune which her father, himself
heartily sick of a broad-horn voyage,
attributed
to the confinement of the boatwas
prevailed upon to take several rambles on
shore, in which she was attended by Captain
Sharpe, now, as every body could see, a fixed
favourite of her father, and, as every body
imagined, of the lady likewise. But it was
observable that Miss Storm never went ashore
without having one of her women also with
her.
Rambling along the river myself, it was
my fate to stumble upon this little party, at
a moment when Captain Sharpe had taken
advantage of a momentary separation of the
fair Alicia from her servant, to drop upon his
knees, and pour into her tender ears a violent
declaration of love.Not that I pretend to
have overheard his actual expressions, for I
was too far from the pair for that, besides
beating a retreat the moment I discovered
them, without their having noticed me; but,
as I saw him on his knees, in an extremely
elegant posture of adoration, I had no right
to doubt what kind of prayers he was making.
How the lady received his vows, whether
favourably or not, I had no means of knowing
or discovering, being in as great a hurry to
get out of the way as Captain Sharpe,
perhaps
,
was to win the lady's heart.
Having no longer any doubt that the
handsome soldier had really formed the design
of becoming the son-in-law of my
commander
,
and remembering Jones's story of his
marriage
,
as well as my resolution to make
Colonel
Storm acquainted with it, if necessary,
I immediately returned to the boat; where
the old gentleman, incapable of leaving it,
was growling over his pangs, and, to my
surprise, invoking all kinds of maledictions
upon Connor, `for deserting him,' as he
expressed
it, in a grumbling soliloquy, `in the
midst of his torments and cares.'
`Sir,' said I, pouncing upon him without
ceremony, and thinking this a favourable
opportunity to open my communication, `I
thought, and so did every body else, you
turned off Mr. Connor yourself!
`What's that
your
business, you
scoundrel
?'
said he, as if enraged at my
presumption
:
`who gave you leave to talk to me
about Tom Connor, or any thing else?'
`Nobody gave itI take it,' said I; `and
I reckon, that, in turning off Mr. Connor,
you got rid of just as good a friend and
honest a servant as was ever misused in a fit
of passionthat's my notion. And I reckon,
moreover, that, in putting Captain Sharpe
into his place, you have helped yourself to a
bit of snake-flesh, that will have a snap at
you, rale viper-fashion, or at some body you
love as well as yourself, some day, there's no
doubt on it.'
`What, you dog!' cried Colonel Storm,
seeming both incensed and astonished, `are
you
abusing Sharpe, too?'
`I didn't know,' said I, `that any body
had ever said any thing against him. But, I
tell you what, Colonel Stormnot to make
a long story about itCaptain Sharpe is
making love to Miss 'Lishy; and it seems to
be generally agreed among us as how you
intend to give her to him.'
`Well, you brazen rascal!' roared Colonel
Storm, looking as if he would eat me, `how
does that concern
you?
'
I had, by this time, got too well
accustomed
to the commander's mode of
conversing
with his people, when in a passion, to
take offence at his expressions; and, therefore,
replied, with as much equanimity as when I
began the conversation,`I don't see that it
concerns me much, any way, Colonel; but, I
VOL. II.19
rather reckon, it concerns a very amiable
young lady; and her honour'
`Her honour, you dog! Do you dare
talk to me about my daughter's honour?'
cried the old gentleman, with increasing fury.
`Colonel? said I, `it don't signify being
in such a passion, and calling me hard names:
I just mean to tell you, that, if you give
Captain Sharpe your daughter, she will get a
husband who happens to have one wife,
perhaps half a dozen of 'em,already.'
`You lie, you thief!' said the veteran,
catching at his crutch,I believe, with the
full intention of knocking me on the head; a
catastrophe which, supposing I should have
permitted it to be attempted, which I was
not disposed to do, was prevented by the
sudden appearance of the young lady; who,
still attended by Captain Sharpe, at that
moment
entered the boat and the cabin where I
had sought her parent. The angry old
gentleman's
eyes flashed with double rage, as
soon as they fell upon the soldier; but, as it
happened, it was with rage not at the latter:
`Here, Sharpe, you thief,' he cried, `here's
the old story over again! Knock the villain's
brains outSwears you are married!'
`At these words, the daughter, who,
seeing her father's wrath, was on the point
of stealing away to her own cabin, turned
round with a look of astonishment and
inquiry
.
`Same old story Tom Connor got up
lying rascal!' continued the veteran: `wife
already,poor deserted woman,
broken-hearted
.Rascally
invention.Tumble the
dog into the river!'
`I beg,' said Captain Sharpe, looking for
a moment a little confused, but soon
recovering
his composure,`I beg Miss Storm will
retire a moment, while I inquire into this odd
adventure.'
Miss Storm gave the Captain a searching,
I thought even a scornfulthough calmly
scornfullook, and then stepped up to her
father, upon whose shoulder she laid her
hand, gazing him earnestly and sadly in the
face. `Father,' she said, `the position in
which I have been placedneed I say, by
yourself?in relation to Captain Sharpe,
entitles
me to inquire into any charges affecting
his honour. I waive the right: I do not even
ask
you
, my father, to act upon it. But I
must be satisfied upon one point. You drove
from you an old and once trusted friend,
Connor: and it seems, (although you never
acquainted me with it,) that he preferred
charges against Captain Sharpe;in short,
the very charges which, it seems, this young
man brings against him.Father! was it
because
of these charges you discarded poor
Connor?'
`Ay!' grumbled the veteran;`told lies
of the Captain:all slander and malice.'
`It is enough,' said the lady; and then
added,`Slander and malice never stained
the lips of Thomas Connor.'
`Spoken like a true-hearted gal!' said I,
vastly delighted to find the poor secretary
had another friend beside myself in the boat:
`And as for this here story about Captain
Sharpe's wife, I hold it to be as true as
gospel
,'cause
how, his own man Jones told
me!'
`Excellent authority on which to damn
a man's reputation, certainly,that of his
own robbing, runaway lackey!' cried Captain
Sharpe, with a laugh; and then requested
that Miss Storm would `remain and hear all
that the fellow (meaning me) had to say
against him.'
`It is neither necessary that I should
hear, nor he say, any thing more against one
who is nowwhatever else he may be
my father's guest,' replied Miss Storm,
calmly
:
`the subject may be more profitably
resumed
hereafter. And I beg,' she added,
`that neither my father nor Captain Sharpe
will cherish any ill will against this young
man, for bringing charges, which, however
unfounded
they may be, had certainly their
origin in good-will to my father, or to me.'
With these words, she retired to her
little
apartment; and Colonel Storm,
denouncing
me as `a great impudent blockhead,'
ordered me out of the cabin. As for Captain
Sharpe, who, I expected, would have been
thrown into a terrible rage, he burst into a
laugh, as soon as Miss Alicia departed, and
told me I was `a very simple fellow, but
would grow wiser hereafter,'a mode of
treating my charges which somewhat lessened
my own opinion of their justice.
And so ended my assault upon the honour
and dignity of Captain Sharpe, in which,
though I met with nothing but discomfiture,
I had the good fortune, without, however,
knowing it until some time afterwards, to
make a friend of the fair Alicia.
19*
CHAPTER VIII.
PREPARATION FOR WAR.VISIT FROM A SPECTRE.
The
next morning, having waited in vain
for our lagging boat, we bade farewell to the
settlers of Gallipolis, by whom we were
advised
to be on our guard during the
remainder
of the voyage; and especially to beware
of the country about the mouth of the Scioto,
where several doleful accidents had already
happened, and where boats were so frequently
attacked that it was suspected the savages
had there formed a permanent post for the
annoyance of emigrants.
We were told also to have a care against
being led into danger by white men
refugees
and renegades; who were accustomed
to present themselves on the banks of the
river, at the appearance of a boat, into which
they piteously entreated to be taken,
declaring
themselves captives just escaped from
the Indians, or shipwrecked boatmen left
helpless amid the horrors of the wilderness;
which protestations, when hearkened to,
commonly
led the unsuspecting emigrant into an
Indian ambush prepared for him on the shore,
and thus to death or captivity. This
peculiar
caution had been several times before
enforced
upon us at the settlements we had
previously
visited; and we left Gallipolis with a
full determination to be cajoled by no such
villanous wiles, how craftily soever devised
and practised.
We were now, as we had every reason
to believe, much nearer to danger from the
Indians than we had been before, in the
higher
regions of the Ohio: yet, it is certain, we
left Gallipolis with less fear and anxiety
among us than when we set out. We had,
in fact, become accustomed to our boat, to
the Ohio, to the solitude of the wilderness
through which we floated, to the idea of
danger
,
which we had conned over in our minds
until we grew tired of it, and turned to
happier
and more cheerful thoughts. We were
better navigators too, and understood our
power of keeping ourselves out of mischief,
by keeping our boat from the banks of the
river, and so beyond the reach of Indian
rifles
;
and, besides, we were all learned in
Indian
wiles and stratagems, to know which
was to know how to escape them.
And thus it happened, that we left
Gallipolis
with light hearts, and approached the
scene where danger was most to be
apprehended
,
with a degree of indifference
amounting
almost to fatality. Such blind security,
growing with increase of peril, and attended
with every kind of carelessness and
negligence
,
was often found among the Ohio
voyagers
of that day, and was as often the cause
of calamities, which a little common-sense
solicitude would have enabled the unhappy
adventurers easily to avoid.
The day on which we left Gallipolis
proved
,
perhaps, the most agreeable of the whole
voyage. It was now late in Spring; the
weather
was warm and genial, and the
magnificent
forests bordering the river were in full
leaf and bloom, filling the eye with beauty
and the nostrils with sweet odours. The
evening was still more delicious, and was
passed by the
engags
in mirth and jollity, in
singing, and even in dancing; for which we
had an incentive provided in a fiddle, sawed
and clawed in the true old `Virginny,' style
by one of the Colonel's negroes. And in
this kind of diversion we were freely indulged
by our commander, because it seemed to
amuse the mind of his fair daughter, who sat
for awhile looking on the dance, smiling
encouragement
.
By and by, however, the weather
changed
,
and a shower fell, which put an end to the
untimely revelry; and the dancers retreated
to the cabin and their beds, leaving the deck
in possession of the usual watch of four men,
of whom the one at the steering oar was the
only one actually engaged in any duty. This
first shower was but the precursor of others,
which continued to fall at intervals during the
night, and of a change from warm to very
cold weather; so that, by and by, the deck
lost many of its chrms, even to the men of
the watch, becoming, in truth, the most
uncomfortable
part of the whole boat. I
remember
being vastly pleased at ending my own
watch, which happened at midnight, and
creeping down to a warm bunk in the cabin,
where slumber was so many degrees more
agreeable than in the cold wet air above.
Upon leaving Gallipolis, Captain Sharpe,
who was often seized with fits of military
fire and zeal, had thought proper to harangue
the crew upon the dangers we ought now to
expect to encounter, and exhort us to a
careful
performance of all our duties, of which
the night-watching was, as he justly
observed
,
the most important; and as we should, in
all probability, during the course of the
following
night, reach the mouth of the Scioto,
which, all knew, was regarded as the most
dangerous point of the whole navigation, he
especially enjoined it upon us, this night, to
watch in realitythat is, to keep our eyes
open and about us, instead of lying down to
sleep, as we had been in the habit of doing
for several nights past. And to encourage
us in our duties, he declared that he intended
for the future, or so long as danger should
seem to threaten, to share them with us
that is, to take part with us in the watch;
and he accordingly appointed himself to the
middle watch, the longest and dreariest of
all, from midnight until four in the morning.
His zeal greatly delighted Colonel Storm,
who swore, `that was the way for a
soldier
to behave;' though I cannot say it was
equally agreeable to the boatmen. On the
contrary, I heard a great deal of grumbling
among them, upon this particular night,
when, at the change of the watch, Captain
Sharpe was heard getting up to join the next
band of watchers. It was generally
apprehended
that the presence of the disciplined
soldier would interfere with all the little
arrangements
which the men might otherwise
have taken to secure their own comfort.
Happily for the grumblers, Captain Sharpe
proved to be no such severe disciplinarian.
I retired to my bed, and there slept,
perhaps
,
three hours; when I was wakened by a
terrible dream of Indians attacking the boat;
which so disturbed and disordered my mind
that I was not able to get to sleep again; and
being weary of my cot, I got up, and crept to
the deck, for the purpose of looking out upon
the night. As I made my way through the
cabin, in which was burning a little lamp,
yielding a meagre light, I was astonished to
perceive Captain Sharpe, with several
indeed
,
as it afterward proved, allthe men of
his watch, lying sound asleep on the floor,
having evidently slipt away, one after the
other, from their duties on deck.
Although surprised at this dereliction on
the part of the gallant soldier, especially after
the great zeal he had displayed during the
day, I was not at all concerned or alarmed,
being of an opinion, which I had frequently
expressed, when kept longer than I liked at
the helmnamely, that the boat could make
her way down the river just as well without
steering as with. Nevertheless, as the
experiment
had never before been actually tried,
I felt some curiosity to find how it succeeded;
and accordingly stept immediately out on
deck to see; which was a feat the less
disagreeable
as the showers were now over, the
clouds had broken away, and the stars
shining
so brilliantly that objects nigh at hand
could be pretty distinctly discerned.
Knowing that all the watch were in the
cabin fast asleep, judge my astonishment to
find, as I did, the moment I reached the deck,
a human figure at the steering oar, and the
boat within but half a dozen yards of the
river-bank, upon which the unknown
helmsman
seemed urging it with might and main;
and fancy the terror that instantly seized me,
when, looking upon the apparition, I
discovered
the spectral refugee, (for who could it
be but he?) the hero of the ghost story, who,
with a person all ghastly to behold, and a
visage bound with a bloody handkerchief,
and cadaverously resembling my poor
discarded
friend, Tom Connor's, had stolen into
the boat, and was now driving it furiously
ashore.
At this sight, I was seized with a
terrible
panic, as may be supposed, and uttering
a yell that instantly roused every soul on
board, leaped from the deck among my
comrades
,
who came tumbling out, some
shrieking
`Indians!' and others asking what was
the matter. I told them we were going
ashore, and that a ghost was at the helm;
upon which two thirds of them ran back into
the cabin, where they fell upon their knees
and cried for mercy, while others, bolder or
more curious, rushed upon the deck to have
a view of the spectre. But the spectre was
gone, entirely vanished away into air, or into
the river; and the only evidence of his visit
was seen as the broad-horn suddenly swept
round a jutting point, which it almost
touched
,
and then, borne onwards by a powerful
current, shot again into the channel.
This extraordinary occurrence produced,
as may be imagined, an extaordinary ferment;
in the midst of which I was summoned to the
presence of the commander in chief; with
whom I found the fair Alicia, looking wild
with fright, and also Captain Sharpe, the
latter
busily engaged in assuring Colonel Storm,
VOL. II.20
for I overheard him, as I approached, that
`all was wellnothing was the matter, only
an uproar made by a man roused from his
sleep by the nightmare.'
`You saw a ghost, you loon?' said
Colonel
Storm, turning from the soldier to myself;
`what's the matter?'
Upon this, I told the veteran the whole
story, not omitting the soldierly desertion of
his post by the gallant Captain
notwithstanding
that this worthy gentleman made
me many significant hints to hold my tongue
among others, by touching his pocket with
one hand and his lip with the other, as if to
say, `keep your peace, and you shall be well
rewarded;' and then scowling like a
thundergust
,
when he found I proceeded, without
regarding
his efforts to check me.
My relation produced a considerable
effect
both upon the old gentleman and his
daughter; but it seemed to me, they were
more struck by the exposure of Captain
Sharpe's desertion of his post, than by any
thing else, the lady looking upon him with
mingled wonder and contempt, while the
Colonel grumbled his displeasure aloud
`Conduct for a court-martialFine
officer-like
behaviour, by George, sir!'
Captain Sharpe declared `it was all a
mistakea very unaccountable occurrence;
protested he had not left the deck two
minutes
,
and only left it to treat the watch, who
were cold and wet, to a glass of liquor; and
that it was a mere accident and inadvertence,
if the helmsman left his post at the same time;'
all whichas unconscionable a falsehood as
was ever utteredthe worthy personage
offered to prove by calling in the men; whose
assertions, backed by his own word, `he
hoped Colonel Storm would think sufficient
to disprove the charge of a single individual
like me, especially after the veritable
nonsense
I had just told them about the ghost.'
`Humph!' said the Colonel, with a snort
`what sort of a ghost was it?'
`It was like Mr. Connor,' said I; `only
that it was pale and grim, and had a bloody
handkerchief round its brows.'At which
words, Miss Storm looked wilder than ever,
and even the Colonel her father started, with
a piteous `God bless my soul! Hope nothing
has happened the boyNever forgive myself,
if he should haunt me!'
Here Captain Sharpe interfered, asking
the Colonel with a laugh, `if he really
believed
my ridiculous story? if he did not see
that the poor lad' (meaning me,) `had been
dreaming; and that all I had seen, or thought
I had seen, was mere visionary nothing.' In
short, I believe he quite staggered the
Colonel
;
who, however, having finished examining
me, ordered me out of the cabin; so that I
never knew what was the result of Captain
Sharpe's ingenious attempt to explain away
his desertion of his duties of deck.
CHAPTER IX.
THE INDIAN CAMPAGREEABLE SURPRISE.
The
sensation produced by this
adventure
on the crew was too deep to readily
subside
,
and they remained upon deck for the
remainder of the night, now questioning me
upon the particulars of the ghostly visitation,
now speculating upon the consequences it
foreboded; all of them agreeing, in the end,
that it was an omen of some disaster, which
must sooner or later, occur. There was no
carelessness or negligence now; the helm was
doubly manned, as were also our three pair
of oars, at which the men voluntarily placed
themselves, not indeed, to row, but ready to
give way with all their force, at the first
appearance
of danger.
In this condition of things, we floated
onwards
20*
till the gray of dawn; at which period
a fog began to settle on the river, obscuring,
although not entirely concealing, the banks,
the larger objects, as the hills and trees, being
still partially discernible at the distance of
one or two hundred yards. At this period
also, we noticed an appearance upon the shore
which immediately forced upon us the
conviction
that the warning of the spectral
appearance
had not been made in vain. This
was the sudden gleam of a fire on the right
bank of the river, followed by a second, and
this again by others; until, in fact, no less
than six or seven different fires were seen
faintly glimmering through the fog and dusk
of morning.
It will be readily supposed that this
appearance
struck us all with alarm, as, indeed,
it did. Not doubting that these portentous
lights came from Indian watchfires, and that
they were burning in the camp of which we
had heard so much at Gallipolis, we
immediately
sent word down to our commander, and
then, without waiting for orders, began to
direct
the boat over towards the Virginia, or
Kentucky side, taking care, however, to
handle
our oars with as little noise as possible,
not at all desiring to disturb the slumbers of
the red barbarians, who, we doubted not,
were lying stretched around the fires.
But there were vigilant watchers in the
dreaded camp; and just as our commander,
startled out of gout and incapacity by the
sudden intelligence, hobbled out upon deck, a
clear voice rang from the shore`Boat
ahoy
!'
and then hastily added`If you are good
Americans, hold oars a moment; we have
good news for youand for all honest men
to carry down to the settlements.'
`You lie, you refugee rascal! cried
Colonel
Storm, with a voice louder than the
hailer's
:
`Can't put any of your cursed tricks
upon an old soldier. Handle your arms, men,'
he added, addressing the crew, and still
speaking
at the top of his voice;`handle your
arms, and give the villain a shot.'
`Give me a shot!' exclaimed the stranger,
with a tone of indignation; `why, who the
devil do you take us to be?'
`
You!
' quoth Colonel Storm, `I take to
be a white Indiana renegade ragamuffin
from the settlementswhose business is to
decoy numskull emigrants into ambush; and
your companions I take to be a knot of
damnable savages, ripe for plunder and
murder
.'
`Sir,' quoth the invisible speaker, `you
were never more mistaken in your life. We
are white men, and soldiersa detachment
of five hundred mounted men from the army
at Fort Hamilton.'
`Hah!' cried Colonel Storm, while all of
us pricked our ears in amazement`white
men? a detachment from St. Clair's army?
Who's your commander?'
`Colonel Darke, of the Infantry,' was the
immediate reply.
The name of this gallant officer, already
well known as one of the best of St. Clair's
lieutenants, completed our surprise, besides
throwing Colonel Storm into a ferment of
delight. `Knew him of oldwere captains
together at Monmouth!' he cried; and
immediately
after, having ordered the rowers to
back oars, demanded `what theythe
detachment
were
doing, or had done there?'
an inquiry which was, however, anticipated
by the stranger crying`We have broken
up the Indian camp herefell upon the dogs
this morning by daybreaktook them by
surprise, destroyed and captured fifty-three
warriors, drowned a dozen or two more, with
a loss on our own side of only eleven killed
and wounded.'
`Back oars;three cheers for Darke and
his gallant men!' cried Colonel Storm, adding
his own warlike voice to the lusty and joyous
hurrahs, which we instantly set up.
`Now,' quoth our friend on shore,' you
behave like men of sense! I am on duty
here to hail boats; by the first one of which
that arrives, our commander desires to send
the news of our victory to the settlements
and the Commander-in-chief.'
`Will bear his despatches, were it to the
end of the earth!' cried Colonel Storm, with
enthusiasm.
`And, perhaps,' said the officer-sentinel,
for such he seemed, `you could make room
for a poor wounded officeryoung Darke,
the Colonel's nephewwhom the commander
is anxious to send to the settlements?'
`Shall have my own bed!' roared our
veteran chief; adding immediately a
command
to `put the boat ashore;' an order
which the crew, excited to rapture by the
glorious news, received with loud cheers, and
instantly put into execution. The prow was
turned to the shore, and all that could seized
at once upon the oars, urging the clumsy
vessel across the current; while the stranger
ran along the bank, directing us to the most
advantageous point to land.
In two minutes, the broad-horn grated
upon the sand, and three of our men, one of
them holding a rope, leaped ashore to make
her fast; the rest of us crowded together on
the deck, looking eagerly for our new friends,
those gallant spirits who had so effectually
swept the banks of the dreaded Indians.
`Three more cheers for Darke and his
brave boys all!' roared Colonel Storm; at
which words a great halloo was raised
but
not by us
. It was the yell of a hundred
savages
,
who suddenly started to life, leaping
from among stones and bushes; and, giving
out such whoops as were never before heard
but from the lungs of devils incarnate, poured
a sudden fire of rifles upon us, which, aimed
at us, all clustered together on the narrow
deck, and from the distance of only a few
paces, wrought the most horrible carnage,
killing, I verily believe, one-half of our whole
number, and wounding, with but two or three
exceptions, every other soul on board. And
in the midst of it all, we could hear the voice
of the fiendish renegade, to whose
unparallelled
duplicity we had thus miserably become
the victims, exclaiming, with a taunting laugh,
`What do you think of the cursed refugees'
tricks
now
, my fine fellows?'
CHAPTER X.
THE INDIAN ATTACK.
`
Push
off!' cried Colonel Storm; but
there were none to answer his call. The
deck was occupied by the dead and the dying
only; all who could move having leaped down
below, where they lay, some groaning and
bleeding to death, some uttering hurried
prayers
,
but all in a frenzy of terror, all trying to
shelter themselves amongst bales and boxes
from the shot, which the enemy, not yet
content
with slaughter, continued to pour into
our wretched boat. Colonel Storm, himself
struck down by a bullet through the thigh,
lay amidst the rest; not, indeed, cowering or
lamenting, but calling upon us, with direful
oaths, now to `push off, and handle the oars,'
now to `get up, like men, and give the dogs
one taste of our gunpowder;' commands,
which, however, no one regarded.
We had struck the land at a projecting
point, and the strength of the current did for
us the service our commander called upon us
in vain to perform; it swept us free from the
bank, and we again floated down the tide
but, alas, only for a moment. With men at
the oars to take advantage of the boat's
liberation
,
we might have easily profited by this
providential circumstance, and made our way
again into the middle of the river, and thus
to safety. But no one thought of daring the
peril of those fatal bullets, which swept the
deck and perforated our flimsy bulwarks of
plank. The broad-horn was left to herself
to the current, which, having swept her from
the bank, in one moment more lodged her
among the branches of a fallen tree, a gigantic
sycamore, whose roots still embraced the
bank, while its branches, stretched out like the
arms of a huge polypus in the tide, arrested
her in her flight, and held her entangled at
the distance of twenty yards from the bank.
`Is there a
man
in the boat?' yelled the
disabled commander, perceiving this new
misfortune, of which the Indians could be
seen taking advantage, by endeavouring to
make their way along the vibrating trunk to
the boat; `Is there a man who would rather
take a wound, trying to save himself, by
cutting
loose from that tree, than die cowering
like a butchered dog, here in the bottom of
the boat?'
Nobody replied, save by looks, which
each directed upon the other, full at once of
solicitation and horror. The Colonel's appeal
was the signal for new yells and hotter
volleys
from the shore, by the latter of which
the two horses, whose furious kicks and
struggles had added to the terror of the
scene, were soon killed, affording a shelter by
their bodies, behind which several of my
comrades
immediately took refuge.
`Cowards!' roared Colonel Storm, `will
none of you make an effort to save your
lives?'
He turned his eyes upon Captain Sharpe,
who, one of the first to leap from the deck,
now lay among the boxes, as pale as death,
and glaring in what seemed to me a stupor of
fear. `Sharpe, by G!' cried Colonel Storm,
in tones of fierce reproach and indignation,
`do you call
that
acting like a soldier? Up
like a man; take an axe and cut us looseor
never more look on my daughter!'
VOL. II.21
Captain Sharpe made no other reply
than by opening his eyes still wider upon the
veteran, and looking even more ghastly than
before; upon which, Colonel Storm, bursting
into a terrible rage, reviled him in furious
language, as a `base dastard,' `a mean
sneaking
villain'in short, every thing that was
vile and contemptible; all which the
dishonoured
soldier replied to only by the same
unmeaning
and cadaverous stare.
In the meanwhile, the bullets were still
showering among us like a driving rain,
destroying
more lives, and wounding the
wounded
over again; while the savages, whose
terrific
yells were as incessant as the
explosions
of their guns, were approaching on
the sycamore, to carry the devoted
broad-horn
by boarding.
`A hundred dollarsa thousand!' cried
Colonel Storm, looking around him with
eyes of mingled wrath and entreaty; `a
thousand
dollars to any man who will cut loose
that cursed bough that holds us! Hark,
men! a thousand dollars! two thousandten
thousandall I am worth in the world! do
you hear, dogs? all I am worth in the world.
Do you hear me, villains? If the savages
board us, they will murder my daughter.
All I am worth in the world to him that saves
her; ay, and herself, too! He that saves her
shall have her to wife, with my whole fortune
for her portion!'
I know not what effect these frenzied words,
wrung by paternal anguish from the old
soldier
,
had in stimulating the spirits of those
few in the boat who really possessed any
power of resistance; but, certain it is, several
of the men immediately betrayed a
disposition
to obey the Colonel's call, and attempt
somewhat towards the salvation of their
companions
.
Wounded by a shot through my
left arm, which was, however, not a serious
hurt, and, as I confess, as much overcome
by fright as the others, I felt a sudden
courage
start in my veins; though such was the
disorder of my whole mind, that I know not
in reality whether it was incited by the great
prize offered by my commander, or by a
feeling
of desperation, which, for a moment, took
possession of me. I snatched up a rifle with
one hand, and an axe with the other, and
sprang to my feet, with the full intention of
cutting the boat loose from the tree, or of
perishing in the endeavour; in which
resolution
,
however, I was forestalled by a
fellow-boatman
,
named Parker, who sprang up
before
me, exclaiming with a profane levity both
singular and shocking, considering his
situation
`A
wife and a fortune, or death and
dtion!' and leaped upon the forecastle,
from which he immediately fell backwards a
dead man, having received a rifle bullet
directly through the heart. His fall quenched
the fire of my own courage, filling me again
with dismay; and firing off my piece at a
yelling savage, whom I saw, at that very
moment
,
stepping from the sycamore into the
boat, I cowered away among the cargo, as
before, without even waiting to see the effect
of my shot.
`Villains and cravens!' cried Colonel
Storm, whom this mischance and failure
seemed to drive into greater frenzy than
before
villains,
who fear to face an Indian!
here's work that will suit your cowardly
spirits better: a thousand dollars to him that
will enter the cabin, and blow my daughter's
brains out! It is better she should die
now
than by the scalping-knife of an Indian!'
CHAPTER XI.
RETURN OF THE SPECTRETHE DELIVERANCE.
I have
no doubt, that in this hideous
proposal, the poor distracted father,
incapable
of rising or moving, and, therefore, of
yielding his daughter any protection, was
quite in earnest; but, of course, this call was
as little likely to be obeyed as the other; though
it stung me into something like shame, that
among so many men as we had still alive in
the boat, there should not be one able or
willing to strike a blow on behalf of a young
and helpless woman. This shame nerved me
anew with a kind of courage, which I had
immediately
an opportunity of employing to
advantage; although certain I am, it must
have soon died away under the horrors that
21*
followed, had not aid and encouragement
reached us from an unexpected quarter.
Three Indians suddenly made their
appearance
at the bow of the boat, of whom
one was still clambering among the shaking
branches of the sycamore, while the two
others sprang, with loud whoops, upon the
forecastle. I fired my piece, which I had
recharged
at the first pulse of excitement, at
the foremost Indian, who fell down among
us in the agonies of death; while a second
shot, fired by some unknown hand from the
river, took effect on his comrade, who also
fell dead. At the same moment, there sprang
into the boat a figure in which I recognised,
at the first glancecould I believe my eyes?
the phantom of the oarthat very spectre,
on whose pallid forehead was wrapped a
handkerchief spotted with crusted blood,
whose appearance had been supposed to
portend
the calamity which had now overtaken
us. The likeness to young Connor was now
more apparent than ever; and, indeed,
extended
even to the voice, with which the
apparition
,
as he leaped upon the forecastle,
exclaimed
,
in tones that thrilled us all to the
marrow`If you are not the wretchedest
dastards that ever lay still to be murdered,
up and shoot!up and shoot!while I cut
the boat loose!' With which words, he
snatched up from the forecastle, where it had
been dropt by the dying Parker, an axe, with
which he immediately attacked, and, with a
blow, struck down the third savage; and then
fell to work on the branch by which we were
entangled, shouting to us, all the while, to
`fire upon the enemy,' whose bullets, aimed
at himself, he seemed entirely to disregard,
while escaping them by a miracle.
`It is Tom Connor
himself!
' cried I,
fired by his extraordinary appearance into
such spirit as I had never before felt`give
it to the dogs, and he will save us!'
I seized upon another gun, of which the
dead and wounded had left enough lying
about, already loaded; and backed by three
other men, who now recovered their
courage
,
let fly among a cluster of savages who
were scrambling one over the other among
the boughs of the tree. My supporters did
the same; and our shots, each telling upon
an enemy, produced, among other good
effects
,
a diversion in favour of our auxiliary
with the axe; who, still wielding his weapon,
shouted to us to `leave our guns and take to
the oars'a command that was obeyed by
myself and one other boatman, who followed
me to the deck.
We had scarce touched the oars, before
the broad-horn swung free, and floated
rapidly
from the sycamore and from the bank.
`Give way, and all are safe!' cried our
preserver, dropping his axe, and springing to
the steering-oar, with which he directed the
boat into the centre of the river, calling all
the time, though in vain, for others to come
up and help at the oars. None were willing
and, alas, as we soon discovered, few were
ableto help us; and the further labour, with
the danger, of completing our escape, was
left entirely to ourselvesto three men, each
of whom stood fully exposed to the shots of
the enemy, of which many a one took effect
on our bodies. It was not, indeed, until we
had put nearly the whole width of the river
between the broad-horn and her assailants,
and when the danger was almost, if not
entirely
over, that we received any assistance.
Three men, of whom one was entirely unhurt,
the others but slightly wounded, then crept
up, and took our places at the oars, which
we were scarce able longer to maintain.
I turned to Connorfor Connor it was
who, crying out, `Well done, Michael Law!
we've saved the boat, if we die for it'fell
flat upon his face on the deck, deprived of all
sense, and, as I at first feared, of life. He
was, indeed, desperately wounded in many
places; having, besides the recent marks of
combat, several wounds, one of which was
on his head, that seemed to have been
received
several days before. Upon taking him
up, I discovered he was still breathing, though
faintly; on which, with the assistance of my
comrades, I carried him into the cabin, where
lay, or rather sat the wounded Colonel; who,
though aware of our escape from the Indians,
was yet ignorant of the means by which our
deliverance had been effected.
`Bravo! victory!' he cried, with
exulting
voice, the moment he laid eyes on me;
`you've beaten the enemy, Mike Law, and
I'll make your fortune! But what poor devil's
this you're lugging among us, where there's
so many dead already?'
`This,' said I, `Colonel'laying the young
man at his feet`is the true-blue that won
us the victoryno less a man than your
turned-off friend, Tom Connor.'
`Tom Connor!' cried he, looking with
amazement upon the youth's countenance,
all pale and stained with blood; `'tis he, by
heavens! But how came he among us?'
`The Lord sent him,' said Iand said it
very seriously; `for, sure, he came in no
mortal
way whatever. All I know is, that he
jumped right out of the river into the
broad-horn
,
shot a savage as he jumped, picked up
Sam Parker's axe, and killed another; and
then cut us loose from the sycamore, and
steered us into the channel.'
`What!' cried Colonel Storm; `Tom
Connor do this? Tom Connor, that was such
a fiddling, dancing, book-reading,
verse-writing
,
womanish good-for-naught? What! Tom
Connor kill two Indians, when that cursed
coward, Sharpe there, slunk away like a
ducked kitten? Call my girl here! He shall
have her, and cut Sharpe's throat into the
bargain. Throw the white-livered rascal
over-board
!'
I turned my looks upon the dishonoured
soldier, who lay, as I had left him, still
cowering
behind a box, with his eyes yet sending
out a ghastly glare as before. Looking at
him more intently, I perceived he was dead:
indeed, he had received a bullet directly
through the spine and heart, which had struck
him while in the act of turning and leaping
from the deck. I informed the Colonel of
this mischance; but he was now hugging and
weeping over the wounded Connor, whom he
swore he loved better than his own soul, and
would never abuse again as long as he lived.
The veteran then, being reminded of his
daughter, bade me look her out in her cabin;
where, guided by the lamentations of her
women, who burst into yells (for I believe
they took me for an Indian,) as I entered, I
found her lying in a swoon, into which she
had fallen at the beginning of the action.
Neither she nor her attendants had received
any hurt, the little cabin being bullet-proof;
and charging the latter to hold their peace,
recover their mistress from her swoon, and
then come to the assistance of the wounded
men, I went again into the main cabin, and
upon deck, to look upon the state of affairs,
and examine into the extent of our losses.
These were, indeed, dreadful. Of twenty
men, nine were already dead, and all the
others, one only excepted, severely wounded,
four of them, as it was afterwards proved,
mortally.
CHAPTER XII.
CONCLUSION OF THE VOYAGE.
But enough of these melancholy details,
continued the narrator, looking around him.
We are now upon the very scene of the
calamity. Upon that bank, where now stands
a flourishing town, (it was the town of
Ports-mouth
,)
were hidden our murderous foes;
upon yonder point lay the sycamore, in
whose boughs we were entangled; and
yonder
,
below, upon the Kentucky shore, is the
cove into which we threw the bodies of nine
men, our murdered companions.The
recollection
is saddening; and it comes to me still
more mournfully, surrounded by these hills,
and those clumps of treesthe remnants of
the old forestwhich witnessed our disaster
and sufferings. I will but mention a few
other circumstances, and then have done with
the relation.
The death of Captain Sharpe, who,
whatever
were his faults, was undoubtedly no
coward
,
(indeed, I afterwards discovered he had
distinguished himself in some of the closing
scenes of the Revolution,) afforded the best
explanation of the supposed panic which had
kindled the indignation of our old commander;
and Colonel Storm himself used afterwards
to tell me, he was shocked to think the
reproaches
and revilings he had given way to,
were poured into the ears of a corpse. But
I am sorry to say, we found upon his body
papers which fully established all the charges
made against him by his runaway servant,
and satisfied even Colonel Storm that, had
he given him his daughter, he would have
wedded her to dishonour and misery.
At the very moment when we were
engaged
casting his body into the river, we
came up with, and took possession of, a
drifting
canoe; which threw, for the first time, a
little light upon the riddle, hitherto
inexplicable
,
of the sudden appearance of Mr. Connor.
It contained a blanket or two, a store of
provisions
,
ammunition, and other necessaries,
including a deal of superfluous clothing, all
VOL. II.22
marked with Connor's name. He had
descended
the Ohio, then, in a canoe, and
alone!
As this suspicion entered my mind, I
bethought
me of the phantom boat, following
us by night; and was frighted to remember
that
I
had made one of the superstitious
party who saluted the solitary voyager with
their rifles. I remembered also the spectre
at the oar; and easily conceived that in that
spectre, falsely supposed to be directing the
boat ashore, I had seen poor Connor, who,
observing our deck deserted by the watch,
and the boat drifting upon the point of land,
had crept softly on board, and was urging her
again into deep water, when my appearance
drove him to flight.
These suspicions were all soon confirmed
by Connor's own confessions, made when he
recovered his senses, and found himself again
restored to the veteran's favour. Though
discarded, and with disgrace, at a moment of
ill temper, which was perhaps increased by his
own petulance, his heart was still with his
benefactor, whom he resolved to follow to
Kentucky; and finding no other means of
descending
the river, without waiting for the
rise of waters that was to waft away the fleet
of broad-horns, he formed the desperate
determination
to follow us in a canoe, which
he had procured for the purpose; and in
which, with a single companion, who,
however
,
alarmed at the perils to be encountered,
deserted him at Wheeling, he commenced the
voyage. From Wheeling, he had descended
the river entirely alone.
He easily gained upon our boat, of which
he often heard news, and all that he sought
to know of his old patron, at our different
stopping-places; but shame and other feelings,
which a young, proud spirit may easily
conceive
,
prevented his joining us, or making
himself known; though they did not prevent
his hovering near us by night, until the
unfortunate
volley we let fly at him, by which he
had been actually wounded, taught him to
preserve a more respectful distance. His
fears and anxieties, however, on this night,
(for
he
had also been told, at Gallipolis, of
the dangers of the Scioto,) caused him again
to approach the broad-horn; when, perceiving
that all hands were asleep, and the boat in
danger of going ashore, he had stolen aboard,
and had just succeeded in making her clear
the point, when discovered by me. In the
confusion that followed, he easily slipped
back again into the canoe, and was hidden
in the darkness of the night. From that
moment, he had kept at a distance, until the
sounds of conflict brought him to our side, to
render us the service to which we owed our
deliverance.
Such was young Connor's story, with
which I may well close my own.
A few hours after the battle we were
joined by a fleet of boats, the same we had
left at Pittsburg, which had passed the battle
ground without loss, and now supplied us
several fresh hands, with whose assistance
we were able to keep them company, until
the voyage was finished, early the next day,
at Limestone, in Kentucky.
Colonel Storm and Connor both
recovered
in a short time from their wounds; and
so did I. And in two months after our
arrival
in Kentucky, I had the satisfaction of
dancing at the wedding of the fair Alicia and
her preserver.
I may add, that to the friendship, or
gratitude
,
of these three individuals, all of whom
seemed to believe I had, in some way or
other, done them good service, I owed a
change in fortune and conditiona
commencement
of happiness and prosperity, which
have, I thank Heaven, followed me with
unvarying
and uninterrupted benignity up to the
present moment.
Thus ended the story of the Bloody
Broad-horn
.And
here its chronicler takes his leave
of the reader.
THE END.
