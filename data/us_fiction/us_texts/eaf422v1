CHAPTER I.
A SOLDIER OF FORTUNE.
At sixteen years,
When he might act the woman in the scene,
He proved best man i' the field, and for his mede
Was brow-bound with the oak.
Shakspeare
.
AMONG the early champions of American
freedom, few, perhaps, bore arms with more
honor to themselves or success to the glorious
cause, than Major Willoughby. He was the only
son of the most opulent farmer in the state of
Massachusetts, who designed his son for the
study and practice of the law. But while he was
preparing for an admittance into Harvard
University
,
the plains of Lexington were wet with
the blood of his countrymen.
Adieu, now, to the peaceful pursuits of
literature
.
The soul of young Willoughby was in
arms; and all the youth of his standing were
flying
to the revolutionary standard. Some
obtained
commissions; but he was of too impatient a
temper to await the dull formula of an
application
,
and the uncertainty of its success. He
therefore endeavored to raise and equip a
volunteer
corps at his own expense; but failing,
from youth and inexperience, in that laudable
attempt, he determined to enter the provincial
army as a private.
His father was strongly opposed to this step,
and the tears of his mother for some time
deferred
its execution. After a long and severe
struggle
,
however, between filial affection and a
romantic
enthusiasm for arms, the latter obtained
the ascendency; and, in the following year, he
joined the American standard at Kingsbridge, a
few days before the battle of White Plains.
But the keen discernment of the immortal
Washington
did not long permit his ardor to burn in
obscurity
.
Having, fortuitously, drawn him from
the ranks to supply some temporary vacancy in
his personal suite, he thought he perceived in
the young recruit, merits too promising to
remain
shrouded by his present situation, and
powers
of action which only wanted a theatre for
their display, and encouragement for their
success
.
A closer inspection soon determined him
to cultivate the seeds of future greatness which
he was convinced he had discovered in the
gallant
youth; and, with this end in view, seized
every occasion of drawing forth those latent
talents
for usefulness, which might otherwise have
been lost to his country and unprofitable to their
possessor. The battles of Trenton, Princeton,
Brandywine, and Germantown, together with
many subsequent events of minor consequence,
so firmly established this favorable opinion, and
did such ample justice to the penetration of his
chief, that in little more than one year from
the period of his enrolment, the fortunate
Willoughby
wore an epaulet, and on the receipt of
his commission from Congress, it was presented
him by his commander in chief, accompanied
with an elegant sword as a testimony of the
general's personal esteem.
The flame, long smothered, now burst forth
without restraint. Placed by the hand of
friendship
in the path of glory, Willoughby
determined
to reach the dazzling goal, or perish in the
race. With the sword of Washington in his
hand, he resolved to carve himself a name, or
leave one behind him written with his blood.
Opportunities soon occurred, and were met by
him with so much bravery and address, that in
less than two years from his promotion, this
young soldier of fortune was brevetted a major,
and his name enrolled on the journal of
Congress
.
He was now but twenty-two years of age,
and had attained to the summit of his youthful
ambition. Honored with the public notice, and
blest with the private friendship of the first of
men, he felt his bosom glow with the most
unbounded
gratitude to Heaven and his noble
patron; and in the enthusiasm of his feelings,
he vowed to devote his future life and services
to Freedom and Washington. To keep this
vow in constant remembrance, he had his sword
fancifully inscribed with the following motto:
My God, my Country, and Washington;
and
on the reverse
Never surrendered but with
life
.
The confidence of his general was not
misplaced
;
for the breast of Willoughby was the
seat of honor and every noble virtue. In the
unfortunate battle of Camden, which soon after
occurred, he added new laurels to the blooming
chaplet that already encircled his temples; but
was there disabled by a wound which for some
time deprived his country of his useful services.
At the opening of the campaign in the
following
year, however, he was so far recovered as
again to take the field, and at Yorktown his
skill and gallantry were so eminently displayed,
that no small share of that day's glory was
attributed
to himself.
Attached to the person of Washington by the
strong ties of gratitude and veneration, he
looked
forward to a separation as the most
unpleasant
occurrence that he could ever encounter;
and the glorious peace of 1783, the
long-looked-for
reward of all their toils and sufferings
the great object of all their arduous struggles
and distressing privations, was embittered to the
grateful Willoughby by the event he so much
deprecated. The army was disbanded, and the
hero who had a crown within his reach and a
sceptre at his command, resigned them both
into the hands of his legitimate sovereign
The
People
, and retired, like Cincinuatus, from the
camp to the plough.
The major could not accompany him in his
retirement, though earnestly solicited; for the
recent death of his father, and the unsettled
condition of his estate, imperiously demanded
his presence and attention in the state of
Massachusetts
,
whither he immediately repaired,
after
taking an affectionate leave of his friend and
2*
benefactor, the Champion of Freedom, the friend
of mankind.
During the happy months of the succeeding
autumn, Willoughby was united in marriage to
the amiable Miss Cushing, a near relative of the
Hon. William Cushing, of Scituate, in the county
of Plymouth; and two purer souls, more
congenial
in sentiment, or more ardent in affection,
never interchanged their faith at the hymenial
shrine. Nearly of the same age, and brought
up from childhood together, reciprocal affection
had, almost imperceptibly, united their hearts;
and sympathy of taste, virtue, and mutual
tenderness
,
gradually mingled their spirits, and
made them entirely one.
If any event was now wanting to complete
his earthly happiness, it was that which
occurred
in the following summer, when his beloved
Amelia presented him with an infant daughter.
This was a new source of untasted delight, and
while the happy father received this dear pledge
of their mutual love in his arms, he silently
ejaculated
his most fervent thanks to the Great
Author
of every good.
Days, months, and years of happiness rolled
on, and three daughters were the fruits of their
nuptials. It shall not be insisted that the
acquisition
of a son would not have tended to
heighten their felicity, but if that reflection ever
drew a sigh from either bosom, it was never
breathed to the ear of the other. They felt
too much gratitude for the blessings which
Providence
had bestowed, to murmur for those which
he saw good to withhold.
CHAPTER II.
THE SPEAKING CORPSE.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes.
Shakspeare
.
Major Willoughby
had been frequently
solicited
to accept of some civil office in his
native
state, but always declined the proposal as
incongenial to his more active disposition. But
in the year 1790, when the Indians of the
southwestern
frontier resumed the hatchet and the
scalping knife, and commenced their desolating
incursions among our back settlements, he again
buckled on the cuiras, and braved the dangers
of the western wilderness against these
unprincipled
savages. But the Sword of Washington
was on his thigh, which, in his romantic
imagination
,
was a talisman more potent than any
recorded in the fables of antiquity. But he had
not now to contend with an honorable
magnanimous
enemy, but to cope with foes more
ferocious
than the panthers that prowled their forests,
more subtle than the serpents which infested
their morasses. A battle was fought in the
winter
following, in which the Americans gained
nothing but honorable wounds, and suffered the
loss of near seven hundred of their bravest
troops. Willoughby was wounded, and General
St.
Clair
very narrowly escaped destruction.
Many skirmishes, much hardships, and little
success attended their subsequent campaigns,
until the year 1794, when, on the twentieth of
August
,
under the gallant Wayne, they obtained a
complete and decisive victory, near the rapids
of the Miami, where the Indians were totally
defeated, and the foundation laid of a safe and
durable peace.
Previous to this important event, Willoughby
had lost a friend to whom he was very strongly
attached, in the death of Robert Elliott. This
gentleman was unfortunately slain near the
Muskingum
river, by a party of hostile Indians,
while he was conducting the necessary supplies
for the American army. This melancholy event
cast a peculiar gloom over the mind of
Willoughby
,
and it was some time before he
recovered
his wonted cheerfulness.
On the morning of the twentieth of August, he
felt unusually dejected, and never had entered an
action with such depression of spirits and gloomy
forebodings, as now hung about him. His
personal
courage had not deserted him, but he
felt sensations which he could neither account
for nor describe. Something seemed to impress
him with the idea that some heavy disaster was
impending over him, and that he should never
again embrace his dear Amelia, or kiss his
prattling babes. It was now five months since
he had left them on the present campaign, and
nearly two since he had received a letter from
his wife. If he should fall in the approaching
contest, it would afford her some consolation to
receive his last farewell. He therefore seized
a pencil and hastily wrote a few tender lines,
bidding Amelia and her children an affectionate
adieu, which he directed to be dispatched by
express, should the event prove fatal to
himself
;
then breathing a silent but fervent prayer
for the safety and happiness of his family, he
was in a moment ready for the field. My God,
my Country, and Washington! he exclaimed
as he drew his well-tried sword, and Willoughby
was himself again.
In the hottest of the engagement, while
hatchets
,
swords and bayonets were clashing in
dreadful
response to the hellish yells of the savages,
the right hand of Willoughby was pierced by
an arrow, and the sword of Washington fell
from his grasp. He had scarcely regained it
when the stroke of a tomahawk severed the
same hand from his wrist. In this situation,
unable to retreat, he fought with his left hand,
until fainting with loss of blood, he was carried
from the field. In the mean time the enemy
were routed, and the victory decided.
O that I had a son! exclaimed Willoughby
when the surgeon had finished dressing his wound,
O that I had a son to inherit this sword, since
I can no more wield it myself. Had I but one
son to give my country in my room. I would
swear never to repine at this misfortune, or any
other that may befal me. I had bound myself
by a most solemn vow, never to relinquish this
weapon but with life, and twice, this ill-omened
day, has it been struck from my hand by a
savage. O that I had a son to redeem my vow.
You have a son! murmured a voice in a
low, but very distinct accent. Every eye was
directed to the spot, where lay the lifeless body
of a Miami Chief, who had fallen early in the
action. The anguish of Willoughby's wound
was now almost forgotten in the amazement
that absorbed his every faculty, and all present
exhibited signs of the most unaffected
astonishment
.
Each one was well convinced that
there was neither life nor motion in the
gigantic
form before them; and that the words
proceeded
from no other source, they were,
however
reluctantly, compelled to believe. If any
doubts existed on that point, they were instantly
removed; for the same words were repeated,
almost
in the ear of an officer who was stooping
to examine the corpse, and yet sufficiently
audible
and articulate for every one present to
hear and understand: You have a son, to
redeem
your vow.
More than eight hundred miles from the field
of battle, at that moment, the wife of
Willoughby
was delivered of an infant. He was, at length,
blest with a son! Blest, did I say? It was a
blessing purchased at a dreadful price, to have
redeemed which, he would have been willing
to relinquish son, daughters, fortune, fame, and
all. Amelia expired in giving it birth! Happy
for Willoughby he did not learn the dreadful truth
until his health was in a great degree restored.
Few men had loved like himfew men ever
experienced anguish like his.
A very natural curiosity in those who
witnessed
the foregoing phenomenon, induced a most
critical contemplation of this oracular corpse.
And here a new source of surprise and admiration
presented itself. More symmetry of form,
regularity
of features, and dignity of countenance,
were never united in man. The prowess of
Hercules
appeared combined with the graces of
Adonis
.
His death-wound was directly through his
heart, and made by a rifle ball: but no distortion
of feature was visible in his aspect; and nothing
like ferocity had shaded the placidity of his brow.
His eyes were closed as in a pleasant sleep, and
every muscle composed in majestic serenity. His
hatchet lay by his side, and he had a dagger in his
girdle of wampum. But who he was, remained an
impenetrable mystery. Several prisoners were
brought to examine him, but neither of them would
acknowledge that he knew him, although his
countenance was one of those which can never be
forgotten. Previous to his being removed from
the spot where he fell, an expert artist, belonging
to the regiment, took a faithful copy of this
interesting
figure, painted at full length, which he
presented
to Major Willoughby on the termination of
the campaign.
CHAPTER III.
A BACK-WOODS-MAN.
Among these lonely regions, where, retired
From little scenes of art, great Nature dwells
In awful solitude.
Thompson
.
The man that consecrates his hours
By vigorous effort, and an honest aim,
At once extracts the sting of time and death;
He walks with nature, and her paths are peace.
Young
.
Many
lingering months rolled heavily away
without restoring tranquillity to the widowed
breast of Willoughby. But he had sworn never
to complain, and not a murmur escaped his lips.
He, however, avoided all society; and a settled
gloom, not entirely untinctured with superstition,
pervaded his mind. He felt a void which nothing
on earth could supply. His only solace was in the
caresses of his children; and his only remaining
wish, to see them educated and happy, and then
to join his Amelia in those blissful regions where
the anguish of parting could be felt no more. His
infant son engrossed his most particular attention;
but the singular circumstances of his birth being
ever present in his imagination, kept alive and
cherished those reflections which were most
detrimental
to his peace. He could not help
considering
him as connected with some extraordinary
destiny, in the contemplation of which, he often
detected himself absorbed in the reverie of
romance
;
so entirely wrapt in a vision of the future,
as to forget the occurrences which were passing
around him. The luxuriant wilds of Miami
occasionally
obtruded on his fancy, and the
phenomenon
of a speaking corpse was not wanting to
finish the picture.
The recurrence of one sentiment, however,
would, at times, absorb every other in his bosom;
and that one was his eternal gratitude to
Washington
.
In reflecting that this god-like man had been
the patron of his youth, and the arbiter of his
fortune, he could almost forget his domestic
affliction
.
The token of his friendship, his
inestimable
sword, was religiously preserved, as the
richest
legacy he could bequeath a son, evidently
destined
by Heaven to wield it with success in the
sacred
cause of freedom. He had already bestowed
on him the name of that illustrious hero, and
fondly hoped that the gift might be accompanied
by a portion of his spirit. As he pressed the
infant
in his arms, he would breathe a mental prayer
that he might be modelled from the pattern of
human
perfection whose name he bore. Make
him but the successful champion of his country's
rights, and it is all the earthly blessing I ask for
my son. This unqualified veneration for a
human
being, was a pardonable weakness in
Willoughby
,
if we take into consideration the
peculiar
circumstances that created it, with which the
reader is already acquainted.
But a new affliction awaited him, which for a
time diverted the current of his reflections into a
different channel. The small-pox broke out in
the neighbourhood, and before the anxious parent
could give that terrible disorder its most
favorable
chance, by innoculation, his two eldest
daughters
again enjoyed the caresses of their angel
mother. Amelia and George recovered.
Willoughby did not become a misanthrope; but
he now determined to adopt a plan which he had
occasionally contemplated, viz. that of bidding an
eternal adieu to the busy haunts of civilization,
and immuring himself, for the remainder of his
life, in the western wilderness. Not as a hermit;
but as a Grecian philosopher, with an
unfrequented
grove for his academy, and his darling
children his only pupils. He had always dreaded
the contagion of vicious example to the young
and inexperienced mind; and at this time all the
vices of the old world were daily imported into the
new, accompanied with their pernicious and
enervating
luxuries. He readily foresaw, that if this
growing evil continued, the rising generation
would prove but weak and puny representatives
of their heroic fathers, the champions of
American
freedom. He lamented that it was not in his
power to prevent so great a national calamity,
but wished at any rate to save his own son, by
snatching him in season from the sphere of
contagion
,
and placing him beyond the reach of its
influence. The loss of two lovely daughters
fixed this wavering resolution. He had not
forgotten
3
the romantic scenes on the southern border
of lake Erie; and in that delightful region, though
then arrayed in the wildest garb of nature, he
determined to fix his future residence.
Accordingly
,
having procured from government the
requisite
patent, sold his paternal estate, and placed
his children under the temporary protection of
their maternal uncle, he took possession of his
wild retreat in the following spring. A few hardy
laborers, procured for the purpose, under his
tasteful and judicious direction, soon converted a
portion of this wilderness into a beautiful garden,
and
literally
caused the desart to blossom as the
rose. In less than two years a neat rural
mansion
was erected on the charming spot, finished in
a style of cottage elegance, and bountifully
supplied
with every domestic comfortsave the
greatest. It stood on a gentle declivity, not half
a mile from the shore of the lake, and about the
same distance from the river Cayahoga. This
beautiful spot abounded with fruit of the most
delicious
kind, and in the most luxuriant quantity.
It was in the centre of a grove of black and white
mulberry trees, interspersed with chesnuts,
cherries
,
plumbs, and the custard apple. At a
little
distance was a forest of sycamore, whose
lofty branches were entwined with grape-vines,
and beneath whose shade reposed the wild deer
and game of various descriptions. Turkeys,
geese, ducks, and swans, were visible in every
direction; and the woods were vocal with their
feathered tenants. This paradisical retreat the
major denominated Mulberry-grove, by which
appellation it still continues to be distinguished,
though most of the trees have disappeared.
A maiden sister, about two years younger than
himself, his two children, a female domestic, and
two or three laborers, composed the whole of
Willoughby's household. This sister had been
disappointed, in a most tender attachment, by
the death of her lover, who fell on Bunker-hill,
gallantly fighting for his country's freedom. The
idea of a second engagement was sacrilege to her
first and only love, and she therefore determined
to remain a vestal for life. She wished to retire
from society, and could think of no situation so
congenial to her present taste, as the rural retreat
of her disabled brother, whom she loved with
true sisterly affection, and whose voluntary
solitude
she wished to solace by her tender
assiduities
.
In the education of his children, his rural
occupations
,
and the society of his sister, the grief
of Willoughby gradually wore away. But it had
imparted a perpetual cast of melancholy, a
sombre
tint to his character and deportment, that
rendered
both peculiarly interesting. His principal
recreations were hunting and fishing; the former,
however, could be but partially enjoyed, from
the loss of his hand. Books, of which he had a
valuable selection, occupied the evening, and
the writing a journal of his military career, was
his morning amusement. Though not liberally
educated, he was an accomplished English
scholar
;
and, since his misfortune, had acquired the
art of writing an elegant character with his left
hand. It is to this journal I am indebted for the
facts here recorded.
He had valuable correspondents, in various
parts of the United States, with whom he
continued
an epistolary communication, among whom
were several members of the general
government
,
and gentlemen of distinction in the army
and navy. Thus was solitude sweetened by
friendship, though uninterrupted by the presence
of friends. Gardening was a science for which
he had a great predilection, and no inconsiderable
taste; at any rate, there are few at this day
which exhibit a more happy combination of
utile
cum dulce
, than that which flourished under the
direction of Major Willoughby.
In this manner lived our modern recluse, if not
happy, at least contented; cultivating, by turns,
the fertile soil without, and the susceptible minds
within. Two of the most perfect of all human
beings, in his estimation, were selected for his
models, and his greatest desire was to form his
children like them: To make his daughter a
second
Ameliahis son another Washington. He
still continued to enjoy the friendship and
confidence
of that patriot and hero, until death
terminated
his earthly career of glory and usefulness;
when, at the age of sixty-eight, he passed into
that permanent state of existence where virtue is
sure to meet its eternal reward.
CHAPTER IV.
SON OF A BACK-WOODS-MAN.
In truth he was a strange and wayward wight,
Fond of each gentle and each dreadful scene,
In darkness and in storm he found delight;
Nor less than when on ocean-wave serene
The southern sun diffused his dazzling sheen.
Beattie's Minstrel
.
George Washington Willoughby
was the
child of Nature, and his greatest delight the
contemplation
of her sublime and romantic features.
This taste was derived from the very source which
gratified it, the rude and majestic scenery which
surrounded the isolated residence of his
childhood
.
Every thing was wild about him, except the
domestic animals in his father's inclosures. The
scream of the eagle and the roaring of cataracts
were sounds familiar to his infantile ear. The
whipperwill's melancholy notes lulled him to
repose
,
and the warbling of the mock-bird awoke
him in the morning. The wild goats were seen
browsing on the sides of the mountain, and the
timid deer brushing through thickets of chesnut
and sycamore. On one hand rose an almost
impenetrable
forest, on the other rolled the waves
of an inland ocean. Here flowed a tranquil river,
and there dashed an impetuous water-fall.
The son of Major Willoughby was a stranger
to the weak indulgences and pernicious luxuries
which enervate the systems and ruin the
constitutions
of half the infantile race. Fed on plain
but wholesome viands, he murmured not for
dainties of whose existence he was ignorant.
Health bloomed in his cheekspleasure sparkled
3
in his eyesstrength and elasticity were
displayed
in his limbs. Every step was a bound
every movement, agility. He was an infant
Hercules.
In disposition he was a compound of
contrarieties
.
With all his father's enthusiasm and daring
enterprise, he had no small portion of his
mother's
gentleness, combined with an obstinacy
which belonged to neither. Any opposition that
encountered this spirit, served only to increase
its inflexibility. His ardor always rose in
proportion
to the strength of the obstacle which
opposed
it. One thing alone could divert him from
the pursuit, and that was a conviction of its
impropriety
;
and he possessed so much intuitive
veneration
for the opinions and authority of his
father
,
that he generally yielded an immediate
assent
and obedience.
The natural objects which surrounded him,
almost
unrivalled for their wild magnificence, were
native to him, for he had no recollection of
having
ever seen any other. Rocky mountains,
craggy steeps, and frightful precipices, were
subjects of his earliest contemplation, and had
at length become as familiar to his footsteps as
the umbrageous vistas of his father's garden.
He would climb the most rugged promontory that
overlooked the lake, leap from rock to rock, and
fearlessly rest on the brink of unfathomable
chasms. With a curiosity ardent as his
perseverance
,
he delighted in exploring untrodden
recesses
,
and penetrating every excavation he
discovered
.
In ascending the tallest tree, he rivalled
its native squirrel, and the finny inhabitants of
Erie were scarcely more familiar to its waves.
He caught birds for his sister, and killed
rattle-snakes
for his diversion. He would angle for
fish, shoot teal with his bow, and swim like a
spaniel for his game.
His amusements were diversified by the
seasons
.
When the earth was covered with the
snows of winter, he coursed down the hills in his
sled, or swept the glossy surface of the lake on
his skates.
In all these health-giving exercises his father
most freely indulged him. They promoted mental
activity, and increased corporeal vigor. While
they imperceptibly begat in his mind the
conceptions
of lofty enterprise, they secured to his
person
the requisite powers for execution.
It is possible, however, that the solitude of his
situation, connected with the wild ferocity of
nature
around him, might have too strongly marked
the lineaments of his character, had it not already
imbibed a trait that corrected the bias. This
was his taste for literature, and eagerness for
intellectual
acquirements. Ever submissive to
parental
counsel, there arose no difficulty in
arranging
a plan for the enjoyment of both his favorite
pursuits, by making each alternately a relaxation
from the other. When his lesson begat lassitude,
athletic diversions relieved. When exercise
wearied, study afforded repose. His constitution
was too mercurial for indolence, either of mind
or body: one or both were perpetually in motion.
The education and recreations of the lovely
Amelia, (who was two years older than George)
were not dissimilar to those of her brother. She
did not indeed accompany him in all his daring
excursions, but she would run, wrestle, pitch
quoits, shoot the bow, and skate with him.
Their scholastic exercises were the same, with
the exception of a few feminine accomplishments
taught by their aunt. They loved each other
tenderly, and were never so happy as in
interchanging
some little offices of kindness. George
would climb trees to plunder birds-nests for
Amelia
;
and Amelia gathered flowers to make
nosegays
for George. He selected the richest clusters
of wild grapes to regale her, or shook the black
mulberries from their branches, while she held
her apron to receive them.
Ignorant of the world, and innocent as the
lambs they caressed, they scarcely knew that
such a thing as misery existed. The melancholy
cast of their father's habits was imperceptible to
them, because they saw nothing but his kindness.
He never, in their presence, conversed on past
afflictions, but merely imparted enough to give
them a vague idea that they had a mother in
heaven
,
whom they should one day see, if they
continued
to be good children. Though a firm
believer
in revealed religion himself, he did not
think it his duty to perplex the unformed minds of
his children with creeds and catechisms which
they could not comprehend. The plain precepts
of practical piety, he was most careful to
inculeate
,
with the great fundamental truths of
theology
;
but always insisted that the human mind
should be in some measure matured before
theology
itself was studied as a science.
Though Willoughby acted as tutor to his
children
,
he was careful to assume none of that
chilling
austerity which too often damps the ardor of
infantile genius, or cramps it in the iron fetters of
terror. He studied with them, and treated them
more as companions than pupilshe was their
friend and adviser. But his commands, though
always mildly uttered, were as immutable as the
laws of Persia. The mandate once passed his
lips, the most implicit obedience was expected,
and (after a few
practical
illustrations of the
penalty
)
never expected in vain.
A natural aptitude to learn, soon made their
tasks a pleasure which they would not have
willingly
relinquished. Amelia was conscious of
being in advance of her brother, yet, to
encourage
his application, she generously affected to be
in the rear; and while she pretended to ask him
for information, was imperceptibly furnishing him
with new ideas. Thus he profited by her
instruction
,
while his feelings were spared the pain of
discovering it.
One source of enjoyment, to George in
particular
,
was the recital of their father's adventures,
to which they would listen with the most greedy
attention, while the various sensations they
produced
in their tender minds, were visibly reflected
from their expressive little countenances.
When the soft twilight of evening had
suspended
the various duties of the day, the season
of social converse commenced. On an ample
platform, before the door, the whole family would
assemble, and while the major was enjoying his
pipe, the children would entreat him to renew the
interesting subject. Perhaps the moon would be
just entering upon a pure field of unclouded
azure, spangled with myriads of glittering
constellations
.
The tenants of a neighbouring fen
would be murmuring their loves, while some
solitary
owl uttered her complaints to the woods.
No scene could be better adapted to the subject.
The whole party could distinctly hear the rushing
of that very stream which received the corses of
many who fell in the battle he was describing.
The nightly howl of the wolf and catamount, at
times, saluted their ears; and the narrator had
reposed
where a watch-fire alone kept those
monsters
aloof. The shuddering Amelia, with an
exclamation of terror, clung closer to her
affectionate
aunt.
The flashing eyes of her brother betrayed the
tire that was kindling in his bosom. It burst
forth:
My dear father, when I am grown a man,
shall I not fight for freedom too?
His hand was extendedhis cheeks glowed
his attitude was supplicating. His father gazed
on him a moment with delight, then snatched him
in his arms, and pressed him to his heart.
Yes, my dear boy! for that was you granted
to my prayerfor that did I devote you to my
country before I knew of your birth. If its
freedom be again in dangerif her rights should
be once more trampled on by tyrantsgo, in
God's name; and may you wield the sword of
Washington with as much ardor and success as
your father has done.
George almost shouted with joy, and strutted
along the platform with the deportment of a hero.
But Amelia wept with terror, flew from her aunt
to her brother, and clinging round his neck,
begged
him to relinquish the dreadful design. If
you should go to these wicked wars, (she sobbed
out) what will become of me! You will be
killed, or lose your-limbs, and poor Amelia will
break her heart.
Be not alarmed, my love; interrupted her
delighted father; I hope we are to enjoy many
years of peace and happiness before another
hostile weapon is drawn. Banish your fears
your brother shall not be taken from you.
With this assurance she returned to the side of
her aunt, and tranquillity was again restored to
her bosom.
CHAPTER V.
AN INTERESTING INCIDENT.
The infant hero takes the daring leap,
And boldly plunges in the frightful deep;
There pants and struggles with the whirling wave,
Risking his own a fellow's life to save.
Anon
.
The
only human visitants, that had ever
interrupted
the profound solitude of the
Willoughby
family, were warriors and hunters belonging
to a neighbouring tribe of friendly Indians.
These untutored children of nature found a
constant
welcome at this seat of hospitality, from
which they never departed without receiving
refreshment
,
and some trifling token of its owner's
bounty. Gratitude is not exclusively the virtue
of christians, although a christian virtue. Many
of these savages possessed it in an eminent
degree
.
The hospitality of
One Hand
became
proverbial among them, and the best of their
game was generally selected as a present for
their host.
It was some time before George could become
reconciled to the presence of these red intruders.
He never saw an Indian but he thought of his
father's
mutilated limb, and felt his little spirit rising
in open rebellion against the doctrine of charity
inculcated by his father. How very evident it is,
that
love thy enemies
must be a divine precept,
when it is so opposite and so repugnant to our
depraved
natures.
To his sister alone he would give vent to his
feelings on this occasion, and console himself
with the hope of soon becoming a man, and
possessing
that wonderful sword whose almost magic
virtues he had so often heard his father extol.
Don't think of it, George! These are not
the bad men who deprived papa of his hand.
You must not be angry with every body for the
fault of one. If you and I were to quarrel,
would you never be friends with me again? Say,
George, suppose we were to be so wicked as to
fight, and I was even to bite off your little finger,
would you never forgive me?
Yes, exclaimed her brother, I would
forgive
you
any thing, even if you broke my arm.
But to cut off the hand, and the right hand too,
of so good and so useful a man as my fatherI
don't feel that I
can
forgive that, Amelia. And
if these are not the same men, I am sure they are
exactly like them, and would be as cruel. The
picture of the strange chief over the fire-place, is
an exact likeness of Tecumseh.
Come, come, George, the great book our
father reads to us, instructs us to judge no one
rashly, but to love all, even our enemies. But
these poor Indians, who have never been taught to
read, are not our enemies now, even if they once
were. Besides, the misfortune we lament
occurred
in open war; and I have heard you say that
in a fair fightShe knew what key to touch.
Yes, I know, Amelia; I won't be angry
with them any more. I am sure it is wrong, else
my father and you would not tell me so. But if
they make war again, when I am big, and have
Washington's sword
Amelia arrested the threat by placing her hand
on his lips. I don't love to hear you talk
on that subject, George; whenever a word is
mentioned about Indians, about war, and about
that terrible sword, your cheeks grow so red,
and your eyes look so fierce, and you seem so
cross, that I hardly know you. Come, my
brother
,
be goodnatured, and let us finish our
lesson
.
In this manner would affection and reason ever
smooth whatever was rough, and soften all that
was hard in the temper of George. By slow
degrees
this very natural antipathy wore off, till a
cool acquaintance grew into friendship and
intimacy
,
when an incident occurred, not very
trivial
in its nature, nor entirely unimportant in its
consequences.
It was a mild day in March. The ice of the
lake was not entirely broken up, nor the snow
dissolved from the hills.
Several of George's red acquaintances, (among
whom was Logan, a chief of distinction, with
his only son) had stopped at the Grove, on their
return from a hunting excursion. On the margin
of the lake was a huge rock, at the foot of which
they had kindled a fire, and were seated around
it on stones, regaling themselves with venison
and rabbit, broiled on the coals, and bread and
cider brought by Amelia from the house.
The son of Logan was playing with George
on the ice. This young Indian was about twelve
years old, hale and active, with regular features
and graceful form. He had already distinguished
4
himself in the chase, and exhibited tokens of
future greatness in the hostile field: he was the
pride of his father, and a great favorite among
the young warriors of his tribe. His long black
hair, which shone like the glossy plumage of the
raven, hung loose upon his shoulders. A cap of
variegated feathers adorned his head; his red
hunting-frock was fastened by a belt of wampum,
curiously embroidered with porcupine quills;
bracelets of party-colored shells ornamented
his wrists and ancles, and his mockasons were
trimmed with the teeth of a catamount he had
slain. As he flew after George on the ice, he
resembled the feathered Mercury of the Greeks.
At some distance from the shore the ice was
thin and frequently open, of which the boys had
been carefully cautioned. But, in the ardor of
pursuit, they ventured too far, and one of these
treacherous openings lay in the direct line of a
race unrivalled by the wind for swiftness.
George, who was on his skates, providentially
saw the threatening danger, avoided it by a
timely curve, and endeavored to warn his friend.
But the speed of the young savage could neither
be arrested nor his course diverted; he flew past
George like lightning, and disappeared beneath
the ice.
Amelia was at that moment accepting from one
of her grateful guests, an ornament for her neck,
ingeniously woven from the scarlet feathers of
the flamingo. It dropped from her hand, while
with a shrick of terror she pointed to the fatal
spot. The Indians sent forth a yell of horror,
and darted upon the ice.
George knew that there was not an instant to
be lost by seeking assistance from the shore
his play-fellow must perish, or be saved on the
moment. He had once risen to the surface, but
beyond his reach; in a moment he re-appeared
at a still greater distance. It was the crisis of
his fate; with a desperate plunge George caught
him by the hair, by which he sustained him with
one hand, while he seized hold of the ice with
the other. The ice gave way, and both were
descending for ever, as Logan caught George
by the wrist, and saved them both from a watery
grave.
By this time the whole family had been alarmed,
and were hastening to the spot, when they met
the dripping youths returning in safety with the
Indians. No words can describe the different
sensations which agitated each one of the now
happy group. In the genuine language of nature
Logan poured out his thanks to the heroic boy
who had risked his own life to save a poor
Indian's
;
while George expressed his gratitude to
Logan for preserving them both.
Congratulations
were mutually interchanged by all.
Amelia
,
however, was insensible to every thing but
her brother; she had seen him plunge into the
water, and could scarcely realize his safety.
With a kind of frantic rapture she now clasped
him in her arms, and sobbed aloud on his bosom.
Noble boy! exclaimed his enraptured
father
.
You have realized my hopes. Doubly
precious to me is that life which has thus been
voluntarily jeopardized to save a fellow being;
yet, dear as it is and ever will be to my heart,
I had rather see it sacrificed to duty, than meanly
preserved by shrinking from its performance.
George had acted, perhaps, more from an
impulse
of instinct, than from any definite idea of
duty: he knew not precisely how much he had
risked, but he was sure that he had gained more
than an equivalent. The commendations he
received
from all, were very grateful to his
feelings
;
but this undisguised approbation of his
father, so warmly expressed, filled his young
bosom with a tumult of delight. In the fulness
of his joy he embraced the grateful object of his
perilous achievement, and called him his
brother
;
and then whispered his sisterYes,
Amelia, this is better than fighting.
This little adventure created a chain of
friendship
too strong to be broken. Never were red
and white so harmoniously mingled, and the
union was too perfect for time to weaken. The
story was circulated with avidity, and celebrated
in the rude songs of the natives. Logan had
always
been a faithful friend to the whites, and a
warm advocate with his countrymen in the cause
of American freedom. The strong tie of
gratitude
was now interwoven with this zealous
attachment
.
Alone and single-handed, he now
would have contended with a host in defence of
his friends.
The son was not backward in evincing his
sense of the obligation he was under to his
generous
preserver. His visits became more frequent
and regular, and any service in his power was
at George's command. He taught him to shoot
the bow with an accuracy that he had conceived
impossible, and to draw an arrow from his quiver
with the grace of Diana; to make canoes of
the bark of trees, and ornament them with a
thousand ingenious devices; to throw the hatchet
with remarkable precision, and sound the
war-whoop
with considerable effect. In short, the
society of the young Indian soon became so
essential
to the happiness of George, that his
impatience
would chide the lingering weeks of his
red brother's absence. His studies were not
neglected
;
but so well did he profit from young
Logan's lessons, that, at the age of ten, George
Washington Willoughby had become quite an
accomplished savage.
CHAPTER VI.
THE BLIND HARPER.
At last a soft and solemn breathing sound,
Rose like a stream of rich distilled perfumes,
And stole upon the air, that even Silence
Was took ere she was aware, and wish'd she might
Deny her nature, and be never more
Still, to be so displaced.
Milton
.
The
current of emigration from the east to the
west, had run so rapidly during the foregoing
period
,
that our recluses began to find themselves
surrounded by civilized neighbors. Though this
circumstance would have been unpleasant to
Willoughby
at an early period of his exile, he now
regarded it with no inconsiderable satisfaction.
He was formed for society, nor had his long
exclusion
unfitted him for its enjoyments. Well
aware that these hardy enterprizing settlers were
not of that class he had been so eager to shun, he
felt no repugnance at their approach. Without
some social intercourse, the manners of his
children
could not acquire a certain degree of
refinement
indispensably necessary on their entering
the world.
4*
He intended that his son, at a proper period,
should finish his studies at the university; but
without some graduating medium, the too sudden
transition from nature to art would be very
unpleasant
to his feelings, if not deleterious to his
hopes; for among the latent qualities of the boy's
mind, which were daily unfolding and presenting
themselves to the parent's view, there was readily
discovered a large share of that exquisite
sensibility
which shrinks from the approach of
derision
or contempt, as the sensitive plant from the
touch.
In the year one thousand eight hundred and
nine, George was fifteen years of age, with a
stature and strength that would have passed for
seventeen
.
In the mean time, several little villages
had grown up around them, the nearest of which
was at the distance of five miles; a few scattering
habitations were somewhat nearer.
The sound of the exterminating axe was now
heard from a thousand directions, and the forests
melted before it. Fire followed the axe, and
luxuriant
vegetation succeeded the fire. Roads
were levelled, waggons constructed, and
intercourse
increased.
With the Willoughby family the ice was soon
broken. Acquaintances were formed, visits made,
and visitors received. The major had recovered
enough of cheerfulness to make every one
pleased
with him and each other; and his sister, now
just on the right side of fifty, exhibited the rare
phenomenon of an agreeable old maid. George
was pleased, and Amelia delighted; for they at
length saw a specimen of that world of which
they had heard a little, read much, and thought
more.
Every thing, by degrees, assumed a different
aspect; and a taste for external accomplishments
was soon observable in these two children of the
desert. Their aunt encouraged and directed the
renovation, while the father smiled his
approbation
of its progress. Thus the few seeds of
refinement
accidentally dropt in the wilderness,
took such successful root, that in a few months
these aukward rustics were looked up to by
the villagers as the models of taste and good
breeding.
It was summer; and, invited by the peculiar
beauty of the scene, our young hero and his
sister
had imperceptibly extended a morning ramble
beyond their accustomed circuit. The dew yet
glittered on the honey-suckle, where the bee had
just commenced his delicious vocation. The air
was lulled into a solemn stillness; not a leaf was
in motion, save that of the aspin; or when the
wild deer rustled through the clustering dogwood
and scattered its blossoms in their path. The
ground was carpeted with the richest verdure,
through which the wild strawberry lifted its
purple
head.
Fatigued with walking, they sat down on a
bank of moss, around which crept the fragrant
sweet-briar and the fadeless laurel, to survey the
various beauties around them. The broad lake
was in view, like a polished mirror, in which the
swan was surveying her snowy plumage and
graceful neck as she sailed along its reflective
surface. At a distance were several vessels
becalmed
,
and here and there appeared a
sportsman
in his skiff, dimpling the lake with his oar.
It was that kind of stillness which can seem to be
heard, that now surrounded them, interrupted
only by the solitary tap of the wood-pecker,
when a soft strain of music broke gently on the
ear. They listened with surprize and delight,
to an air of peculiar sweetness, but as new to
their ear, as were the tones which composed it;
now swelling with impressive energy and then
dying away in the softest murmurs. It seemed
the effect of enchantment, and they rose to
discover
the unseen minstrel.
After proceeding some distance, they suddenly
emerged from the woods, and found themselves
at the door of a small log house, built in the
Indian
style, of square timber, the joints and
crevices
plastered with clay; a little further were
several workmen laying the foundation of a more
commodious mansion. The music which had
drawn them to the spot had ceased, but they
believed
this cabin contained the performer; nor
were they mistaken, for while they hesitated
about entering, the strain was renewed,
accompanied
by a female voice. They paused on the
threshold, and listened in breathless delight to
the following song:
Hibernia's tears forever flow,
Her barp in silence slumbers;
Her bards the patriot song forego,
Nor dare to breathe its numbers.
No more they bid the swelling tone
In Freedom's cause awaken;
Those happy days of bliss are flown,
And Erin weeps forsaken.
But though her sons in exile roam,
They sleep on Freedom's pillow;
And Erin's daughters find a home,
Beyond the western billow.
There shall they breathe the glowing strain,
To joy's extatic numbers;
There Erin's harp shall wake again,
In rapture from its slumbers.
All was again silent in the cottage; but the
curiosity of the delighted auditors was far from
sinking to repose with the closing strain. In
their eagerness to obtain a sight of the performer
and his unknown instrument, ceremony was
forgotten
:
they lifted the latch and entered
unobserved
.
Every thing within wore an air of comfort and
neatness; but this was not yet observed by the
curious intruders, for their attention was riveted
to a more interesting subject. On a bench
directly
opposite the door, sat the most venerable
figure they had ever beheld, in front of whom
stood an elegant formed girl, holding a cup of
milk to his lips, with a hand of the most delicate
whiteness; and beside him stood the instrument
from which he had drawn such enchanting
melody
.
The harp of Erin was instantly
recognized
,
of which George and Amelia had often
read, but which they had never seen nor heard
until this fortunate morning. The position of
the female prevented her seeing the visitors; and
the old harper, as they immediately suspected,
was bereft of sight.
It has been intimated that our young foresters
possessed sensibility and enthusiasm. Both had
been excited by the adventure, and were now
heightened by the scene before them.
Enough, my child, said the old man, as
she took the cup from his lips, and wiped his
silvered temples with her white handkerchief;
thank you, my lovethank you.
George never took pains to suppress his
feelings
,
unless they were accompanied by a
consciousness
of criminality, and then he generally
conquered them. But he felt no such conscious
ness on the present occasion, but exclaimed with
considerable vehemenceAn angel! Amelia,
an angel! The old harper uttered an
exclamation
of surprise, while the cup fell from the
hand of the startled damsel. An apology,
however
,
was instantly made, with so much grace
and good-breeding, that the whole group were
perfectly satisfied and pleased with each other,
and after half an hour's conversation, felt less
like strangers than they did like old
acquaintances
.
In the course of this interview, our
adventurers
learned the following particulars: that the
name of their beautiful little hostess was
Catharine
Fleming; that Ireland was her native
country
;
that the old blind harper (Dennis O'Hara)
was her grand-father, and that her parents were
just gone over to the neighboring village, from
whence she every moment expected their return.
While Catharine and Amelia were engaged in
conversation, George had approached the harp,
and begged permission to examine its form and
construction. He touched the wires, and they
complained in discord. Both then united in a
request to hear its aged master perform, who
politely
complied, and charmed his guests with
several
popular airs of his native country. He
commenced with the ancient
Gradh gan fios
,
[1]
[1]
Love in secret.
which is perhaps one of the most pleasing
compositions
that any country has produced, and his
auditors were in extacies during its performance.
He next played
Ad ccoigreac ma bin tu
,
If to a foreign clime you go.
which
he informed them was the oldest air now extant.
It is so ancient, added he, that the name of its
author is unknown, and no trace can be
discovered
of the century in which it was produced.
At the Belfast meeting of harpers, on the twelfth
day of July, in the year one thousand seven
hundred
and ninety-two, it was sung by only one
person, who was of great age, and although
numbers
were present, few knew it even by name;
but we were all greatly delighted with the
composition
,
and I learned it on hearing it repeated.
He then performed Carolan's
Fairy Queen
, and
the ancient air
Ta an samradh teacht
,
[2]
[2]
Summer is coming.
and ended
with the celebrated
Scarfuint na Gompanach
.
Pasting of Friends.
In these performances his very soul seemed
engaged, bursting its tangible fetters, and
floating
in melody to another world. His feelings, at
length, became too ardent, tears fell on his hand,
and his grand-daughter prevailed on him to stop,
and attend to some cheerful topic of discourse.
But the instantaneous change of a key, is as
difficult
in feeling as in music.
Be not surprized, young man, that these
poor blind eyes should weepthey have seen too
much. Yes, he continued with increased
emotion
,
they have seen one of my sons expire on
a scaffold for his contempt of tyranny, and
another
dragged like a slave on board the tyrant's
floating dungeons. No wonder their sight was
blasted.
The curiosity of George was excited, but he
saw the propriety of restraining it for the
present
,
and joined with his sister in diverting the
old man from the subject. My poor uncle
Patrick, said Catharine, in answer to Amelia's
enquiring glance; he was but the theme
was too painful, and she paused. Uncle
William
is in the navy, she resumed, wiping a tear
from her eyeon board the Majestic, please
God he be living. The old harper groaned
heavily.
In a few minutes they were joined by the
parents
of this charming girl, just returned from the
next village, whither they had been to make
some necessary purchases. A mutual
introduction
took place, and the conversation became
general, pleasing and animated; till, alarmed at
the height of the sun, Amelia proposed to return,
and these new friends separated with mutual
promises
of improving their intimacy.
On their way home, George suddenly awoke
from a deep fit of musing, and exclaimed, I
must learn to play the harp, Amelia, and O'Hara
shall be my teacher. At breakfast, the relation
of their adventure was closed with the same
suggestion
.
His father was always ready to indulge
every innocent wish; a harp was purchased by
his agent at New-York, and George soon became
a player of no inconsiderable merit. In the
mean time, his sister, under her aunt's tuition,
could touch the guitar with judgment and taste.
Her voice was melody itself, and George turned
poet to furnish her with songs.
CHAPTER VII.
A DIALOGUE ON POLITICS.
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace
To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not.
Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,
Thy God's, and truth's.
Shakspeare
.
Major Willoughby
soon became intimate
with his Irish neighbors, and deemed their
society
a valuable acquisition. Fleming had been,
for several years, the proprietor of an extensive
linen factory, in his native country; but being
nearly ruined by the treachery of an agent, he
had collected the scattered fragments of his
fortune
,
and migrated to America. Ohio lands
were cheap, and he had purchased a farm
adjoining
that of Willoughby, both extending to the
shores of the lake.
Fleming was now about forty years old, and
had seen the world without becoming
contaminated
with its vices. His reading had been
extensive
,
and his observation discerning. He
could converse with equal facility on literature,
agriculture, or the arts. The politics of Europe
were familiar as his garter, and in ethics or
philosophy he was never at a loss.
Mrs. Fleming possessed a very amiable
disposition
,
social in her manners, and delicate in her
sentiments; but destitute of that repulsive
stiffness
which is often assumed and mistaken for
modesty
.
Her education was not finished, but
natural
good sense supplied the deficiency. Blest
with a strong retentive memory, and an excellent
taste, she could immediately copy and adopt for
5
her own, what it cost others much pains and
study to acquire.
Their daughter, Catharine, had counted thirteen
springs, and in that little period had made a
progress
in the useful branches of education,
uncommon
for her sex in this age of false
refinement
.
She was blest with parents, who both
united in the unfashionable opinion that a correct
knowledge of reading, writing, grammar, and
history, added to a thorough acquaintance with
her needle, were more valuable acquirements
than those which are merely ornamental, and
therefore ought to be studied
first
. They
contended
that the former would remain a
never-failing
source of profit and delight, long after the
season for enjoying the latter was for ever gone.
Happily for Catharine, she had imbibed the same
notion, and was as ambitious of excelling in the
useful sciences as her school-mates were in the
polite accomplishments. Having thus early
secured
the most valuable and lasting, she was
ready to commence the lighter exercises of
ornament
and refinement, when the revolution in her
father's circumstances at once interrupted the
arrangement
,
and demonstrated the utility of that
system on which it had been made.
But Catharine Fleming needed no external
ornament
to render her pleasing. A soul of innocence
and beneficence emanated through her beautiful
countenance, and charmed every one with its
sweetness. Whether in the city or country, the
ball-room or dairy, she would still be lovely, for
her
beauties were all her own, all internal, yet
all visible.
But what more particularly endeared her to the
Willoughby family was her affectionate attention
to her poor old grand-father. O'Hara was blind
and possessed no earthly solace for his affliction
but his harp and his darling grand-daughter. The
former had been the friend and companion of his
youth; the latter was the eyes and comfort of his
age.
While bending over his harp, and drinking in
the melody of its silver tones, the images of past
enjoyments would sometimes rush on his mind,
and drown his sightless eye-balls with tears.
These were wiped away by the tender hand of
his favorite, and his mind diverted to forget their
source. She would call to mind his favorite song,
and warble it in concert with his harp.
A few months after the event recorded in the
foregoing chapter, Fleming dined at the Grove,
in company with a gentleman, who was then on
a tour of public business through the western
country. This was Judge Brown, from the state
of New-York, one of Fleming's earliest
acquaintances
on his arrival in the United States; a
member
of the Society of Friends, a magistrate of no
inconsiderable celebrity, and well known as a
man of learning and exemplary piety.
The early education of Brown had been such
as the youth of that sect commonly receive;
accurate
and useful so far as it went, without
aspiring
to elegant literature, or mere speculative
science.
[3]
[3]
See Analectic Magazine, vol. v. p. 292.
But his mind was too active and
inquisitive
to rest content with these humble
rudiments
,
and by seizing upon every opportunity of
improvement, he had gradually acquired a large
fund of various and well-digested knowledge.
He had for several years resided in the city of
New-York, as teacher of the public school of the
society of Friends, but had afterwards been
induced
,
by the offer of an advantageous purchase
of a large tract of land, near the shore of Lake
Ontario, to remove thither and establish a
settlement
,
which had rapidly improved, while Brown
rose with it, in wealth, importance, and public
estimation. He was now judge of the county
court, and a leading man in all the public
business
of that part of the country.
After the cloth was removed, an interesting
conversation commenced on the subject of
botany
and chemistry, with which the Judge was
intimately acquainted. The progress of
American
manufactures was the next topic, on which
Fleming appeared perfectly at home.
The subject of manufactures insensibly led to
that of commerce; and from commerce, at that
day, it was remarkably easy to slide into politics.
The negotiations then pending between the
United
States and Great Britain were spoken of,
when the major expressed a confident hope that
an amicable arrangement would take place with
the two governments, peace be preserved, and
commercial rights respected; and ended with
something like an encomium on England, which
gave more surprize than pleasure to the mind of
Fleming.
Is it possible, Major Willoughby, he
exclaimed
,
that such can be your sentiments of
a nation, whose injustice and violation of faith
have become proverbial all over the world;
whose ambition claims the sole and supreme
government
of the ocean, the great highway of
nations
,
and who extends her conquests for the
purpose
of enslaving the vanquished?
I am no apologist, returned Willoughby,
for the ambition of England, and least of all
for the injustice of her corrupted ministry. It is
of the nation at large that I speak, people like
ourselves, who would as readily and cheerfully
render justice to us, as to each other. I allude to
the
people
of England, and not to the public
servants of that people, who have too often
deceived
and betrayed them. In my opinion,
gentlemen
,
these two nations, America and England,
are distined by heaven to become the two
greatest
on earth, and will one day be united in the
strictest bonds of amity and peace.
Was such thy opinion during the
revolutionary
war? enquired the quaker.
Yes, sirwe warred against a government
that would have enslaved us; and to preserve
our freedom, were obliged to raise our hands
against our brethren; not that we loved them
less, but that we loved our posterity more. We
fought for rational liberty, were successful, and
all antipathies should cease. Enemies in war
in peace, friends.
But how, sir, exclaimed Fleming, is it
possible for antipathies to cease, when
aggressions
are still continued? You say America was
successful. But let me ask, what security has
she acquired from foreign insults and injustice?
Although England may not attempt to raise a
revenue in our states and territories, does she
not still do it from our commerce, and are not
some thousands of native Americans enslaved in
her navy?
When I express a hope of an amicable
adjustment
of differences, observed Willoughby,
I wish to be understood as meaning also an
honorable
reparation for injuries, indemnity for
the past and security for the future. Much as I
5*
desire peace, I would insist on strict justice.
For though it is the duty of an individual to
forgive
,
bear, and forbear, the precept will not
apply
in a national point of view.
I have always understood, interrupted the
Judge, that whatever could be predicated of
an individual, was equally predicable of a body
or a nation. I would thank thee, friend, to
discriminate
.
I conceive differently, replied the major;
as an individual I forgive, bear, and forbear,
because I am willing to undergo, for my single
self, all the temporal evils resulting from such a
conduct, in order to conquer my natural
propensity
to the contrary, and discharge my duty as a
christian. All this I should do and suffer for the
sake of promoting my eternal welfare. But as
the representative of a nation, I have no right to
control the freedom of their will by entailing on
them the temporal evils of humility, without I
could, by so doing, promote their future and
eternal welfare; for any acts of forbearance on
the part of government, however laudable in
themselves, will never be imputed by the
Almighty
to a people who do not sanction them.
So that what is a present loss and eternal gain to
an individual, would be a permanent loss and no
future gain to the nation at large.
But dost thou not believe, asked Brown,
that the Almighty would bless that nation whose
government acted on such principles, and
preserve
them not only from temporal evils, but
future
ruin?
No, sir, answered the major, I cannot
believe that the Almighty will ever bestow any
peculiar blessing on a wicked man for the sake
of a good one. His blessings flow alike to all,
if all would prepare themselves alike to receive
them.
But it seems to me, gentlemen, that you are
wandering from the subject, said Fleming;
you say, major, that government ought to
exact strict justice from England, as the basis of
an honorable treaty?
I am of that opinion, sir, and hope, at the
same time, that they will not overlook an account
of the same nature which remains unsettled with
the French emperor.
There, sir, cried Fleming, I must beg
leave to differ with youthe account with France
is not of the same nature. The French
government
never impressed your seamen, murdered a
Pearce, attacked a Chesapeake, nor violated the
edicts of your government. Still, sir, I am no
apologist for Bonaparte; I consider him on the
continent what his rival is on the ocean, an
insatiable
tyrant, thirsting for universal dominion;
and to all tyranny, of every description, I am a
sworn and eternal enemy.
All the aggressions you have mentioned,
answered the major.
must
be atoned for; or else,
not withstanding the horrors attending on war,
(the greatest but one of human calamities) the
respect we owe ourselves, and the justice we owe
our posterity, will compel us to the dreadful
alternative
.
But I hope better things.
Pray, sir, enquired Fleming, to what
political party do you belong?
Willoughby smiled. To none, sir: I am an
American, the only name I professa champion
of freedom, the only title I covet. Whoever
endangers
that is an enemy, not to me, but to my
country.
Not your enemy, major? asked Fleming in
a tone of surprize.
No, sir, I never had an enemy. I lost a
hand, not in fighting for myself, but in defending
my country. Though my sword has tasted blood,
my feelings and passions had no agency in the
act. I felt that I was engaged in a duty similar to
that in which we are engaged in fighting and
subduing
our internal spiritual enemies, our evil
propensities
,
which we are commanded to overcome
and destroy, though dearer to us than life. For
as we do the one for the welfare and happiness of
the country which protects us, so we perform the
other for the promotion and extension of our
Redeemer's
kingdom; and our share of felicity in
each is always proportionate to the uses we
perform
for both.
A very strange discrimination, and most
singular
comparison, was Fleming's remark.
Pray friend, enquired Brown, to what
religious
sect dost thou belong?
Willoughby again smiled. To none, Sir.
In religion as in politics, I know but one party.
I am a christian, and know of no name under
heaven by which man can be saved, but that of
Jesus Christ, our Creator and Redeemer.
But this is again flying from the subject,
said Fleming. You say, sir, that you are an
American, so are we all (by birth or adoption);
but which of the two administrations do you
prefer
,
the federal or republican?
Mr. Fleming, you must consider the question
of considerable importance by the earnestness
with which you urge itbut I consider it of no
importance whatever. The last fifteen years of
my life has been passed in a wilderness; I have
taken no part in the various questions of policy
which have arisen in that period. From the
loop-holes of retreat I have, indeed, occasionally
peeped at mankind, and like the poet, whose
expression I use, have sighed for their follies and
crimes. I have seen two great political parties,
by turns, possess the ascendency and hold the
reins of government. I entirely approve of
neither
.
I have found much to commend, but still
more to condemn in the measures of both.
Self-love
,
and the love of dominion, have, in my
opinion
,
influenced them all, and this will continue to
be the case until human nature is renovated.
A singular politician! exclaimed Fleming,
as he rose to departbut, we will renew the
subject at another time. Mr. Brown, I shall
expect you to tea.
A still more singular christian, said the
quaker, with a smile. Pray tell me, friend,
how dost thou reconcile the doctrines of Christ,
for whom thou appearest to have a great
reverence
,
with thy notions of patriotism and military
duties?
My dear sir, replied Willoughby, there
is not a man on earth, even the most zealous of
your sect, that is more fully convinced than I am
that all the wars which have ever desolated this
fair globe of earth, have originated from `
men's
lusts which war in the members
.' The lust of the
flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life,
are the
fuel
which evil spirits, by blasts from
hell, too often kindle to an infernal blaze in the
hearts of the children of men.
How then canst thou conscientiously engage
in them?
Why, sir, in my opinion, answered the
major, the true merits of the question must rest
upon this point: is it lawful to resist the unjust
aggressions of wicked men, in their mercenary
or ambitious attempts to rob us of those
inestimable
blessings, and unalienable rights, which
nature
,
or rather nature's God, has bestowed upon
us, in order to promote our happiness, and the
happiness of our posterity?
Trust to God alone, answered the quaker,
and he will protect them for us.
Pardon me, replied Willoughby; would
not that be like casting ourselves from the
pinnacle
of Solomon's temple, and trusting to God to
give his angels charge to bear us up? This
would be tempting God, as the devil wished our
Saviour to tempt him, when he made that
proposition
,
not knowing that he was addressing God
himself. But permit me to illustrate my first
position
:
That infernal spirits can only effect their
evil designs, in this world, through the medium
or agency of such unhappy mortals as have,
previously
,
been brought under their wicked
influence
by passive compliance, is a truth, which
no christian, I presume, will deny; and hence
by a transposition as logical as any in algebra,
the question before us, when stripped of all
external
terms and forms, appears to be this:
Is
it lawful, upon gospel principles, to arrest or
oppose
the movements of infernal spirits, in
attempting
to deprive us of those blessings which a
bountiful
and gracious Providence has bestowed upon us as
men, or as christians?
I would answer in the negative, said the
quaker. Let every meek, just, and pious man,
so oppressed, plead, rebuke, and remonstrate
against the impropriety, impolicy, and injustice
of such offenders; and to convince and turn the
current of public opinion against them; which
would, as it became general, sweep gradually
their oppressors into the fathomless ocean.
Religion
is supernatural and checks self-defence
.
But self-defence, sir, is the first law of
nature
,
it is a principle implanted in us by God for
the preservation of our lives. It is this principle
which prompts us to extend our hand when
falling
,
or to guard off an impending blow; or, if that
is out of our power, to disable the hand which is
giving it. I still think, sir, that it would be
tempting the Almighty to remain in either case
perfectly passive, and trust to him for
protection
.
I will grant, replied Brown, that
self-defence
is
the first law of
nature
, but those who
are united to that which is far superior to nature,
have nothing to do with itI mean those who are
united to that which causes us, contrary to
nature
,
to love our enemies. For God loved us
while we were his enemies, and we, by loving
them, become godlike and godly. He that loves
his neighbour as himself cannot kill or plunder
him, consequently cannot go to war with him.
Show me a nation, replied the major, who
are all, nearly all, or even a majority of them,
united to Christ in the blessed union to which
you allude, and I will grant that the celestial
sphere which would in that case surround them,
would repel a host of foes, and be to them a wall
of impenetrable brass. But where is there such
a nation?
But has not persecution, when rightly borne,
been advantageous to the cause of the
oppressed
;
asked the quaker, and so much so,
that the blood of the martyrs is proverbial, as
being a seed to the church? If so, who need fear
but that the Lord will help those who trust in his
protection?
I will admit it, sir, replied Willoughby,
provided those who trust in him have so far
become
united to him by a good life as to deserve
his protection. But with what face can an
unregenerated
wilful sinner say, `I trust to God for
protection.' It is little less than blasphemy, for
he has no right to claim or expect such protection
he has suffered himself to become an internal
associate with evil spirits, and he must fight his
way with their earthly representatives as well as
he can. Will not the same observation apply
to a nation of which a large majority are
unrepenting
violators of the divine law?
Thy mode of reasoning is rather novel,
observed
the quaker, and perhaps I do not
perfectly
comprehend it. But tell me, friend, why
was not the quaker administration of
Pennsylvania
attacked and plundered by the savages as
were the fighting New-Englanders?
That may be accounted for, replied the
major, by that noble spirit of equity and sound
policy towards the Indians in which William Penn
founded his community; but, still, sir, on
examining
their history, we find that at Philadelphia
there were commonly a few regular troops for the
protection of the peaceable. And even under
the government of the Penns, when there was a
majority of quakers in the legislature, a sufficient
number of them were obliged to resign, and
non-quakers
placed in their room, in order to vote
some military supplies on a requisition of the
executive
of the province. Here was evidently an
impracticable theory tested, and, as such, should
have been abandoned as disorderly in its action.
I am not prepared to controvert the fact,
friend; but are not the precepts of the gospel
expressly
against taking up the sword?
Yes, sir, and also expressly against
disobedience
to those in authority; therefore, if we
suppose the command to obey those in authority
sacred, and the command not to take up the
sword sacred, it is evident that when the
government
orders its citizens out to defend their
country
,
one of these two laws, both equally
authoritative
,
must fall to the ground. So that herein
an apparent incongruity is ascribed to the
Scriptures
,
where, in fact, no such incongruity exists;
for I believe that the divine law is adapted to
three different states in man, viz. the state of
wickedness in which he is by nature, and which,
for distinction sake, I will term his
natural
state;
a state of growing better, which I will
distinguish
by the term
progressive;
and the state of
being positively good, (I mean a restoration to
that
paradisical
state in which man was
pronounced
good
by his Maker.) Now, sir, if you
will allow me to use these three different terms,
to distinguish the three different states
predicable
of man, I will proceed.
I have no objection to the terms, friend,
replied the quaker, and I must confess that in
thy premises there seems to be something like
method. Proceed.
Admitting then, continued the major, that
every man must be in one or another of these
three states, either positively bad, growing
better
,
or positively good, it must be allowed that a
mode of conduct which would become him in
one
6
of these states, would be highly absurd, and
entirely
out of order in
another;
for the divine law,
embracing a threefold period of actions adapted
to these three different states, provides within
itself rules for each period respectively, and it
is our duty to exercise our rationality in
discriminating
what is suitable and proper to our actual
state, either as individuals, societies, or nations.
I am all attention, friendproceed.
The precepts, then, of the gospel,
continued
Willoughby, embracing, as they do,
three different states of progression, give to man
an understanding and perception, in due order,
of what is relative to his existing condition therein,
beyond which, if he attempts to soar, he quickly
becomes the victim of his temerity, by lapsing
into enthusiasm. Thus the circumstance I have
mentioned respecting the vote for military
supplies
,
in the Pennsylvania legislature, may be
deemed a successful exhibition and refutation of
spiritual enthusiasm.
But it is most certainly the duty of all men in
all states to do right, interrupted the quaker.
We are all called upon alike to imitate Christ
who went about doing good. Does not this
command
apply to every state of man?
Yes, sir, but if you review my premises,
you will instantly perceive, that when a man in
the lowest or
natural
state begins, from pure
motives
,
to practise this command to do good, he
then leaves the first and enters into the second
state mentioned; he is then no longer in a
natural
but a
progressive
state, (as we agreed to call the
two first) he is evidently growing better, and if
he continues to obey the command in that state,
until it becomes his greatest delight to do good,
until it is his meat and drink to do his Master's
will, he then passes into the highest state of the
three, which we agreed to term
paradisical
, and
then his regeneration is complete. We should
certainly imitate Christ, but this imitation must
be according to the practical order in which we
are placed as parts of a whole; not as distinct
integers in external things. For instance, in our
imitation of the blessed Redeemer, it would be
ridiculous and absurd to attempt the same things
that were done by him, as to work miracles,
walk on the sea, or die on the cross.
We can at least imitate him in humility,
replied
the quaker; we can imitate him also in a
reliance on divine protection. `Put up thy
sword,' said he to Peter; `the cup which my
Father
hath given me, shall I not drink it?
You are right, sir, returned the major, as
far as you go; but you stop short of the point we
are aiming at. When our Lord caused his
disciple
to put up his sword, telling him, at the same
time, that legions of angels were at his command,
if he chose to call them to his assistance; we are
instructed that it was agreeable to the divine
providence that he should suffer, not resist; for
in this he was the type of a future church whose
members shall have all arrived at the third state,
which we have termed
paradisical;
I say he was
herein a type or figure of the
paradisical
man in his
own future celestial church, when all shall submit
themselves, without resistance, to his supreme
power. But to attempt to practise this
submission
until we have attained that state, is out of
order in individuals, and still more so in the
government of a nation. At this day, and in our
present low state as to goodness and truth,
submission
,
on quaker principles, would be a direct
acknowledgment of the authority of evil to govern
comparative good, and force to govern wisdom,
which, in my opinion, almost amounts to an
avowed allegiance to the devil; (pardon my
plainness
)
as if the right to reign was in him, and,
therefore, we should unresistingly submit to his
government.
Thy reasoning appears to me strange and
contradictory, observed the quaker; but give
me leave to ask one plain question: Would not
the extension of our principles eventually stop
the ravages of war, and tend to introduce a
millenium
?
It appears evident to me, answered
Willoughby
,
that whenever good sense and sound
discretion pervade a community generally, it must
have a decided aversion to war. But we find
that the quaker institution has not operated to
prevent war; nay, it has operated the other way;
for the Friends, by taking too high ground, have
been less useful than they might otherwise have
been, as a christian seet. It was not so with our
Lord, who sat with publicans and sinners, that
he might thus enjoy a fit opportunity for
instructing
them. Indeed, I speak from experience
when I say that there is scarcely a situation where
a religious man, if he has firmness and good
sense, can be more in the way of doing good
than in a camp.
Thy remarks on this subject, said the
quaker
rising, are new and interesting, but not
quite intelligible to my comprehension. But I
will give them a due weight in my mind, and call
on thee again to pursue the subject. But now the
lateness of the hour compels me to depart.
Farewell
.
CHAPTER VII.
DAWNING AFFECTION.
Round Love's Elysian bowers
The softest prospects rise;
There bloom the sweetest flowers,
There shine the purest skies;
And joy and rapture gild awhile
The cloudless heaven of Beauty's smile.
Montgomery
.
Major Willoughby
had resisted frequent
solicitations
from the maternal uncle of his children,
who resided in Boston, to permit Amelia to pass
a twelvemonth with his family in that metropolise.
The great length of the journey, however, and
their mutual reluctance to a separation, had been
hitherto urged against the proposal. But it was
now renewed with so much earnestness by every
member of the Cushing family, and not being
objected
to by Amelia herself, it was agreed that
when her brother repaired to New-England, to
complete his preparation for entering Harvard
University, Amelia should, at the same time,
comply with the urgent wish of her mother's
relatives
.
This event was to take place on the
following
spring.
George was already a good classical scholar,
and had, until lately, pursued his studies with
unremitting industry and assiduity. Climbing
trees and mountains had not in the least retarded
them; hunting and fishing had not once
interrupted
them; his Indian associates and athletic
exercises had never hindered or delayed the
performance
of a task or the getting of a lesson.
6*
But, somehow, his harp, that fascinating harp,
seemed now to engross his whole attention.
O'Hara had agreed to give him three lessons a
week; but George was at Fleming's at least once
a dayprobably to practise: but if I have any
recollection of the nature of the human heart at
that tender age, it was to practise a lesson never
included in his contract with the old harper, or
even thought of by the parties. Nay, the pupil
himself was ignorant of the subject, nor ever
dreamed what proficiency he was making, until
this course of studies was interrupted.
I have said that George became a poet to write
songs for his sister; but I feel it my duty to add
that these little juvenile productions were always
sung
first
by Miss Catharine Fleming. Kate
had a sweet voice, and it was very natural to try
them by that ordeal before submitting them to the
inspection of the right owner. To be sure,
Amelia would sometimes express a little surprise
at the uniform sameness of the subject, and
archly observe, that had they come from any
young man, save her brother, she should
certainly
have considered them as overtures of the
tenderest regard.
It is not easy to determine how these
complimentary
effusions were relished by the Hibernian
lass, but she possessed too much good breeding
to refuse rehearsing them when requested by
George; such a refusal would have been rude,
and nearly tantamount to condemning the pieces.
And so, from a principle of politeness merely, she
always sung them in her best style, while the
poet performed an accompaniment on his harp.
When George was not present she was always
repeating them, without a second. The
following
is offered as a specimen.
YES OR NO.
The groves their vernal sweets have lost,
No blossoms now perfume the gale,
The lawns are silver'd o'er with frost,
And autumn lingers in the vale.
But do the seasons, as they roll,
Affect the heart with joy and woe?
Can autumn thus depress the soul?
Or spring elate it?yes, or no?
The grove again shall yield its shade,
And vernal sweets perfume the gale,
The modest violet deck the glade,
And richest verdure clothe the vale.
But will the flower of hope survive,
And gain from spring a brighter glow?
A smile, sweet maid, would bid it thrive,
Wilt thou bestow it?yes, or no?
The foregoing lines were sung extempore, by
George, at the conclusion of a lesson, when no
one was present but his old blind tutor and
Catharine
.
The first verse went off unnoticed; but
there was such a peculiar expression thrown into
the last, that his lovely auditor raised her soft
blue eyes from her needle, and met the ardent
gaze of the poet. A sensation at once new and
indescribable darted through her frame, raised a
slight tremor in her bosom, and called the
carnation
to her cheek. George rose gently from his
seat, and repeated in a softer tone and still more
tender cadence,
Wilt thou bestow it?yes, or no?
Her answer was a bewitching smile. In a sudden
extacy he forgot himself and imprinted an
impassioned
kiss on her lips. Catharine dared not
chide him, because that would have betrayed to
her grand-father this little breach of decorum in
his pupil. Her disposition was too gentle to bear
anger, and she smiled her forgiveness on the spot;
when, in George's hurry to express his gratitude,
he inadvertently repeated the offence.
Until this period George had exhibited no
indications
of a passion for the belles-lettres, and it
was not without considerable surprise and regret
that his father noticed the sudden and
extraordinary
metamorphosis. Logical disquisitions had
given place to lighter exercises, and all internal
excitements to action appeared to be at once
transferred from the head to the heart. The
investigation
of the major and minor of a syllogism
was less pleasing than the modulations of those
two keys on his harp. The solution of a problem
had become dull and tedious, while the
construction
of an acrostic or sonnet was productive of
amusement and delight.
Willoughby beheld in these unwelcome
symptoms
,
if not the total frustration of his hopes, at
least a dangerous innovation on his
long-concerted
plans. His scheme of education had been
calculated to insure that energy of mind and
strength of nerve which he considered
indispensible
in the cabinet or the field. To this end all
his labors had been directed, for on this point all
his wishes centered. Success kept pace with
exertion, and promised to crown his brightest
hopes. Every revolving month met his son
nearer the goal; and no obstacle had retarded
his speedno allurement diverted his course.
No wonder then that the anxious parent was
grieved to witness his present aberration, to see
him quit the race when the prize was almost
within his reach. The major had always felt
something like contempt for the profession of a
poet, which he held in nearly the same light as
Chesterfield held that of a fiddler. Pay them for
their performances, (was the precept of both) but
never perform yourself.
A modern poet, he would sometimes say to
his children, always reminds me of the story
of Little Red Ridinghood, who, being sent on an
errand, sauntered from the high road into the
fields, where she amused herself with chasing
butterflies and plucking dandelions, until the
approach
of evening alarmed her, when she had to
grope the remainder of her way in darkness, and
the end of her journey was ruin.
Had the major been aware of the
real
cause of
the change he lamented, it would have given him
little or no uneasiness, for he would have thought
it a mere temporary delirium, which the next
summer's novelties would quickly dissipate in air.
It would have given him no surprise to learn that
the society of so charming a girl as Miss Fleming
had produced such effects in the mind of a youth
like George, who had been brought up in
seclusion
,
without ever conversing with a female, save
his sister and aunt. He would have recollected
that Cupid often joins in the innocent gambols of
childhood, and though not able to pierce the
bosom with his dart, will often tickle the lips with
its feather.
Willoughby took an early opportunity of
expostulating
with his son on the frivolity of his
present pursuits; and George, for the first time,
listened to paternal advice with pain, and
promised
obedience with reluctance.
The winter passed rapidly away, and all the
beauties it had stolen from nature were soon
restored
by spring. The period was at hand for
George to bid a long adieu to the scenes of his
childhood, and both pleasure and pain were
mingled
in the contemplation of the event. His
father
and sister were to accompany him on the
journey; but, his aunthis harpand
Catharine
were to be left behind.
For several successive days previous to his
departure
,
he had waited on the Flemings for the
purpose of taking leave of the family; but had
always returned without introducing the subject.
He could not account for it, but he felt that every
day increased the difficulty. He had never known
the pain of parting with a dear friend, and he
shrunk from the trial. But knowing the
impossibility
of avoiding it, he at length summoned
resolution
to meet it.
To-morrow I set out for New-England, said
he to Mr. Fleming, in a tone of assumed gaiety, as
he rose to depart; have you any commands?
None, sir, I thank you; but accept my most
sincere wishes that a pleasant journey and future
prosperity may attend you.
And do you leave us so soon? asked Mrs.
Fleming. Indeed, Mr. Willoughby, we shall
lack your society much.
Nothing, madam, but duty could induce me
to leave scenes which will always be so dear to my
recollection, and to relinquish society to whom I
am so fondly attached. But I hope to revisit
them again at every autumn vacation.
Poor George! had he reflected on the
shortness
of the vacation, and the prodigious length of
the journey, he would have expressed no such
hope.
You and Catharine have been playmates
together
so long, said Fleming, that the poor
girl will be quite lost without you. Will you not,
my dear?
Catharine was marking a handkerchief for
herself
,
had nearly completed the C, and was too
intent on her work to reply. She, however,
stole a side glance at George, which spoke a
volume to his soul. He saw her tears, and his
own voice faltered as he said, I think, sir,
that we shall not forget each otherat least I can
answer for myself.
Catharine's needle flew still more rapidly.
And do you part with your friend so
unceremoniously
,
my love? asked her mother,
surprised
at her daughter's apparent inattention;
not even wish him a pleasant journey!
Her tears fell fast on her work.
What letter do you call that, my love,
enquired
her father, with a smilea C or a G?
It was indeed a G, and the distressed girl hid
her face in the handkerchief. George pitied her
embarrassment, from his soul; and Mrs. Fleming
began to suspect that her reproof had been
malapropos
.
Katy, my dear, you are ill!
Who is ill? cried O'Hara. Come hither
my darling, to your grand-father, and tell me what
ails thee.
She darted to the old harper, clung round his
neck, and wept aloud.
What is the matter, my little pet? enquired
the old man, alarmed at her convulsive sobs
who has hurt or ill-treated thee? Tell your own
grand-father what the matter is!
Nothing, sir, nothing at all; only I wasI
had a littleI am not ill now, indeed I am not; I
am quite well.
Why, how your poor cheek burns!
continued
the old man, you have quite a fever, and
tremble all over like a leaf. Your mother must
put you to bed.
This is the effect of your wild-goose-chase
after a foolish bird, observed Fleming, and then
turning to George, he continued, the mock-bird
you gave her escaped from his cage, and Kate
has been pursuing him over hedge and ditch the
whole morning, and has probably caught cold.
But the bird mocked her pursuit.
And what could induce the little rogue to
leave you? cried George, now venturing to take
her hand.
Because I loved him, I suppose, answered
she, smiling through her tears.
If you love him, replied George, with a
gentle pressure of the hand, I am certain that
he will return to you. More was meant than
met the ear, and the affectionate girl read it in
his speaking eye.
Her father had walked to the window, and she
stood without the sphere of her mother's
observation
.
It was a critical moment: if their lips
were to meet in eighteen long months, now was
the time; the request was made, and the assent
given by the eyes alone; their lips did meet, just
as Fleming was turning on his heel towards them.
I shall certainly claim it as my property,
cried George, affecting to have been speaking
about the handkerchief; since you have marked
it with the initial of my name; and I will appeal
to your father for the justice of my claim.
Fleming decided in his favor; but Catharine
objected.
Consider it as a loan, then, said George,
and I will leave my harp in pledge for its safe
restoration.
Catharine had lost her bird, and began to fear
that she should possess no visible token to remind
her of her absent friend, when the last
proposition
was made. She therefore assented to it
with more pleasure than she was willing to
express
.
That handkerchief was still moist with the
tears of affection, and George would have sooner
parted with an eye than have relinquished it.
Had she asked in return a kingly crown, like
Flodoardo, he would have pledged himself to
procure it.
CHAPTER VIII.
THE JOURNEY.
O how canst thou renounce the boundless store
Of charms which nature to her votary yields:
The warbling woodland, the resounding shore,
The pomp of groves, and garniture of fields;
All that the genial ray of morning gilds,
All that the mountain's sheltering bosom yields,
And all the dread magnificence of heaven:
O how canst thou renounce, and hope to be forgiven?
Beattie's Minstrel
.
On
the twenty-fifth day of April, in the year
one thousand eight hundred and ten, Major
Willoughby
,
with his two children, commenced their
journey. Willoughby and Amelia rode in a light
covered waggon, drawn by a pair of young bay
mares, and driven by a lad who had, for some
7
time, served them in capacity of cowherd and
ostler. George was mounted on a spirited black
gelding, which his father had given him on his
last birth-day.
The morning was fine, and the early flowers of
spring were here and there peeping through the
tender verdure that covered the earth. Their
course was nearly east, and the sun, just
emerging
from the dusky forests before them, seemed a
golden beacon to direct them. All nature was
awake, vivified, and happy. The sound of the
axe was heard from the woods, and every thicket
was vocal with the matins of their feathered
tenants. Our hero and his courser were both
elated, and the whole party alive to the beauties
around them. On the left, further than the eye
could reach, was spread the unruffled waters of
Erie, and on the right, the scene was pleasingly
diversified with farms and cottages, leafy groves,
and lengthened prairies, cornfields and orchards,
hills and vallies. The lilac was in bloom, and
its fragrance sweetened the air.
They stopped to take leave of Fleming, whom
they found alone in his garden; his wife and
daughter were gone to the village, so that George,
Catharine, and Amelia, were spared the pain of
a formal parting. George dismounted and
entered
the house, where he found his old tutor
playing his favorite
Ad ccoidreac ma bin tu
. They
parted with mutual regret.
The travellers proceeded on their journey.
As they ascended a little eminence which was
soon to conceal from their view the dear scenes
of their childhood, George and Amelia often
looked back, while various recollections crowded
on their susceptible minds. The road began to
descend, and the party continued sunk in musing
silence for several miles. The major first awoke,
struck with the wonderful improvements which
the country exhibited.
Fourteen years before, he had travelled over
the same tract, when scarce a mark of civilization
cheered his solitary way. Then, journeying with
pack-horses, his party could scarcely penetrate
the dark and tangled forests, or ford the
impetuous
streams. Now all was changed. A good
road was levelled before them, and the streams
were arched with substantial bridges. He was
prepared to behold a great alteration, but it far
exceeded his anticipations. The yell of the
savage had given place to the cheerful note of
industry; the solitary canoe of the Indian was no
longer seen stealing along the bank of a river in
quest of his game; but instead thereof, vessels of
considerable magnitude, loaded with the produce
of the soil, were sailing majestically towards the
lake, destined for the Canadian market.
They had provided a stock of provisions in the
carriage, as a remedy against the probable
scarcity of inns on this unfrequented road, so
that they might take refreshment on any pleasant
spot, in the open air; but for lodging they
depended
on the hospitality of the scattered settlers.
Soon after mid-day they reached the banks of
Chagrin River, on which they found a most
beautiful
spot, where they alighted for refreshment and
repose. A spring of pure water gushed from the
foot of a rock, and after meandering over a path
of gravel, fell into the bosom of the river. A
natural
shelf, on the side of this rock, served them
for a table, and banks of moss furnished them
with seats far richer than velvet. Their repast
was moistened with some exhilirating American
wine, from the vineyards of New-Switzerland,
in the Indiana Territory, where the enterprising
Swiss emigrants had been very successful in its
manufacture. At a short distance below them
was a fine farm, and an orchard of thriving fruit
trees; herds of cattle were seen reposing in the
shade, or browzing in the thicket; the rapid
clicking of a distant mill, serenaded them on one
hand, and the tinkling of a sheep-bell was heard
on the other.
After finishing their meal, and feeding their
horses, they resumed their journey along the
banks of this rapid stream, to an indifferent
bridge, on which they crossed, and travelled
onward
through a country more thickly settled
than any they had yet passed, since leaving the
vicinity of Cayahoga. Lake Erie was no longer
visible, the road lying about three miles from its
shores; but the sylvan prospect still continued
delightful. In a few hours they reached the bank
of Grand-River, where they found a commodious
inn, at which they determined to pass the night.
Here they met with a venerable old missionary
from New-England, who had been on a visit to
New-Salem, a Moravian settlement of Christian
Indians, on the western bank of Huron-River,
about forty miles from Mulberry-Grove. He was
now on his return, but had been detained several
days at Grand-River, by an attack of the fever
and ague. He was, however, so far recovered,
as to be able to proceed in company with the
Willoughby
party, who resumed their journey on the
following morning.
Their road lay along the left bank of the river,
to the lake shore, of which they now had a
beautiful
and uninterrupted view. Here they crossed
the river on a handsome wooden bridge, and
proceeded
along the margin of the lake, on a road of
sandlevel, smooth, and so firm, that their
horses feet left no traces in its unyielding surface.
The morning was clear and beautiful, the lake
unruffled, and the road delightful. High on their
right, rose the almost inaccessible bank, like a
wall or parapet, varying in its height from thirty
to seventy feet, and extending, both before and
behind them, as far as the eye could reach. For
above fourteen miles no human habitation saluted
their view.
The good old missionary was a valuable
acquisition
to the party; his conversation was
improving
and entertaining, and he appeared to be
perfectly
well acquainted with the road they were
travelling; describing every prominent feature of
the country, between Cleveland and Erie. He
gave his companions a brief history of the
people
to whom he had been preaching, and related
many ancedotes which had occurred during his
stay among them. He also described many
natural
curiosities, and Indian antiquities, which he
had visited and inspected; among the latter, he
mentioned the numerous remains of ancient
fortifications
,
with which the western country abounds,
burrows for the dead, images, inscriptions, and
curious utensils. The most of these, however,
were familiar to his auditors.
The fortified camps, observed the
missionary
.
I consider the greatest curiosity of all, and
am sometimes almost induced to believe that
nations
have existed in this country, all traces of
whom are now lost. At any rate, we are certain
that the erection of such works as those appear
7*
to have been, was never the result of savage
ingenuity
or labor. What is your opinion, Major?
On this subject, replied Willoughby,
conjecture
may weary itself in vain. At what period,
by what people, and for what purpose, these
works were constructed, no one living can inform
us. The oldest natives have lost all tradition
respecting them, and their history must for ever
lie buried in oblivion.
One tradition respecting them, replied the
missionary, is yet extant among the tribe with
whom I have been residing. It is by them
believed
,
that some thousand moons ago, their
forefathers
had become so monstrously degenerate,
and abominably wicked, that the Great Spirit
sent an entirely new species of beasts among
them, which destroyed them by thousands; and
their description of these animals exactly
corresponds
with the skeleton of the mammoth, several
of which, you know, have been dug up in
different
parts of the western country. The number of
these monsters, they say, was small, but their
size and strength so prodigious, that a whole
family would scarcely serve as a breakfast for the
least of them; and such was the extent of their
ravages, that the world was rapidly becoming
depopulated.
In the midst of the general consternation,
one old sachem alone, esteemed by his tribe as a
prophet, appeared cool, collected, and
undismayed
.
He had often exhorted them to abstain
from their enormities, and had predicted the
punishment
which their evil deeds were drawing upon
their devoted race. But they heeded him not,
until too fatally convinced of their folly. He
now preached to them with more effect and
success
,
and persuaded them to repent of their
misdeeds
,
reform their lives, and boldly unite in a
system of defence against the common enemy,
instead of deserting their wigwams, and leaving
their squaws and papooses a prey to the ruthless
devourers. They listened to his remonstrances,
and all united in the work of defence, with so
much industry and zeal, that in a few days a
hundred
of these forts were erected and provisioned,
into which they all retreated on the next approach
of the enemy, and there sustained a regular siege,
until their besiegers famished for the want of
food.
And could not those mighty animals carry such
a fortress by storm? asked George with a smile.
I think not, replied the missionary. If
you ever visit Peale's Museum, in Philadelphia,
and examine the skeleton of the mammoth, you
will think so too. He must have been even more
unwieldy than the elephant, which, I believe,
has never been celebrated for his agility in
leaping
.
No, sir; allowing the tradition to be
founded on fact, the poor mammoth must have
stood gazing wishfully over the wall, and starved
with plenty in view. They say that he was
created expressly to prey on man, and that
human
flesh was his only food. If such was the
case, he must have circumambulated the parapet
in despair; feasting his eyes with dainties, which
were beyond the reach of his jaws.
If it was thus that the race became extinct,
how happens it, asked George, that their
bones are not always found near these
fortifications
?
That is also accounted for, returned the
missionary. It is supposed that many of them,
as a last resort, applied to the salt-licks for relief,
and there expired; and it is thought by some,
that all wild animals resort thither, merely for the
medicinal virtues contained in the salt. One late
traveller, indeed, has gone so far as to assert that
the air of this state is `impregnated with a
poisonous
exhalation, so offensive, even to the brute
creation, as to compel them to migrate several
hundred miles, annually, in search of an
antidote
,
which he takes to be the real cause of their
visits to the salt-licks and springs.
The travels of Mr. Ashe, replied
Willoughby
,
lately published in some of the
eastern
states, from which your quotation is made, is
a work calculated to give very erroneous
impressions
to the minds of foreigners, and for that
purpose
alone was it written; a pitiful attempt,
among many others, to arrest the current of
emigration
.
We who reside in the regions he affects
to describe, know the work to be a tissue of
falsehood
and contradiction, and I lament the
prostitution
of that press through which it has gained its
ephemeral existence.
You express yourself, sir, rather warmly on
the subject, observed the missionary; but I
agree with you in opinion; and could easily point
out to your recollection a gross libel for every
page. The investigation, however, would
furnish
no reward for the trouble.
By this time our travellers had reached an
aperture in the palisade which led into the
country
,
and a plantation opened on their view. Here
they stopped to feed their horses, and partake
of some refreshment. They then again set
forward
,
still pursuing their journey along the banks
of the lake, and, about sun-set, arrived at
Ashtabula-River
,
which they crossed in a large
flat-bottomed
boat, and were hospitably entertained,
at the boatman's house, on the opposite bank.
On the morning they resumed their journey,
and, after travelling about seventeen miles,
entered
the state of Pennsylvania. Here the
country
gradually became more elevated, the
settlements
more numerous, and the roads far better.
Towards the close of the day, they reached a
beautiful turnpike, which led them to the town of
Erie, where they arrived at about eight o'clock
in the evening.
Here Major Willoughby found a distant
relation
,
with whom he had frequently corresponded,
and who was so rejoiced to see the party, that he
insisted on their spending a week at his house.
This invitation was, however, declined, and
after reposing two days beneath his hospitable
roof, and taking leave of their fellow traveller,
they again set forward, and arrived at
Maysville
,
a thriving little village at the head of
Chataque
Lake, in the state of New-York. This
beautiful lake is about eighteen miles in length,
and about three in width, surrounded by groves
of oak, chesnut, and hickory, here and there
interspersed
with cottages and farms; the face of
the country agreeably undulated with gentle
swells and fertile vallies, and well watered with
springs and brooks.
On the following morning they left this village,
and proceeded, on an indifferent road, towards
Bath, a post-town in Steuben county, a distance
of more than one hundred miles, which they
reached on the third day, at noon, and where they
again enjoyed a few hours' repose. From Bath
they travelled through Catharine's Town to
Ithaea
,
a small village of about fifty houses, near the
south end of Cayuga Lake. Here they reposed
one night, and then proceeded, on a fine new
turnpike, to Owego, a considerable town in
Broome county, where they dined, and arrived
at Unadilla late in the evening. This was the
most pleasant route they had yet travelled, being
along the banks of the Susquehanna River,
abounding with beautiful and romantic scenery.
The next morning they continued their course
on the Appian Way Turnpike, which stretches
among the lofty hills through which the
Susquehanna
flows, and crossed that delightful stream
at the Great Bend, where stands a handsome little
village; then travelled through the valley formed
by the Salt Lick Creek, and left the river far
behind
them. After crossing the north-east corner
of Pennsylvania state, and the river Delaware,
they slept at Bethel, in Sullivan County. On the
following evening they arrived at the village of
Newburgh, pleasantly situated on the bank of the
majestic Hudson.
Here the major sold his rustic equipage, and
George was, with great reluctance, persuaded
to part with his favorite horse. The mode of
travelling
,
however, in this part of the country, had
become so easy and delightful, that the remainder
of their journey required no such auxiliaries.
They embarked on board of the North River
Steam-boat, on the following morning, for
New-York
.
The admiration of our back-woods party was
considerably excited on seeing the huge canoe
propelled along by the irresistible power of
steam; but their attention was soon diverted from
the wonders of art to the beauties of nature, who
appears to have chosen the borders of this stream
for the boldest strokes of her pencil. The rude
and solitary grandeur of West-Point, inspired
George and Amelia with ideas of sublimity which
the shores of Lake Erie had never suggested.
With the rocks near the mouth of Cayahoga,
[4]
[4]
Col. Broadshead suffered
shipwreck here in the Revolutionary
war, and lost a
number of his men, when a strong wind arose, so that
the last canoe narrowly
escaped. The heathen Indians, when they
pass this
impending danger, offer a sacrifice of tobacco to the
water.
which for several miles project over the lake,
rising seventy feet perpendicular from the water,
they were indeed familiar; but their effect was
not so striking as that produced by the present
scene. What they now beheld was a fit subject
for the pencil of a
Salvator
, or the pen of a
Radcliffe
:
Rocks on rocks piled, as if by magic spell,
Here scorch'd by lightnings, there with ivy green.
To Willoughby the scene was familiar, and
recalled to his mind events that were long past,
while he pointed out the interesting objects to his
children. There stood the fortress from whose
impregnable walls the storm of war was rolled
back upon our invaders; where the traitor Arnold
plotted his country's ruin, and where the patriot
Washington toiled for her safety. The narrator's
bosom glowed with sensations to which he had
for some time been a stranger, and the manly
tear trembled in his noble eye.
As they glided along between these stupendous
piles of mountains, a kind of silent awe
insensibly
crept through the hearts of our admiring
young strangers; a feeling which the sullen
majesty
of the scene is admirably fitted to inspire.
The banner of freedom was waving in the
clouds, above the frowning ramparts of Fort
Clinton; and George's bosom bounded with a
sudden glow of enthusiasm as it caught his eye.
At that moment the distant roll of the drum floated
to his ear, and he shouted his feelings in a
rapturous
huzza!
As they proceeded down the river, his father
pointed out the spot where the Vulture, a British
sloop of war, had been stationed, to facilitate the
treasonable negociations of Arnold, and where
the unfortunate Major Andre had been landed to
communicate with the traitor. Fortunately for
America, but unhappily for the gallant Andre,
the Vulture shifted her position while he was on
shore, and the boatmen refused to conduct him on
board, as she lay exposed to the fire of a cannon
which had been sent to annoy her. In attempting
to effect his escape by land, he was taken, and
suffered death as a spy. Arnold escaped on
board the Vulture, and was conveyed to
New-York
,
then occupied by the enemy.
In a few hours our travellers found themselves
in the first commercial city in the United States,
where they tarried long enough to adapt their
costume
to the prevailing fashion, to visit the
public places of amusement, and to inspect every
object calculated to excite or gratify curiosity.
On the twentieth day of May they embarked on
board a New-England packet, and after a
pleasant
voyage of twelve hours, arrived at Newport,
in the state of Rhode-Island.
CHAPTER IX.
SPRIGS OF LAUREL.
Sons of the deep, ye spirits brave!
'Tis yours to build Columbia's fame;
To prove her rights on ocean's wave,
And spread a balo round her name.
Skilful and bold, by labor nursed,
By honor taught, by hardship tried;
In danger and in glory first,
Your country's hope, her joy, her pride.
Anon
.
At Newport, Willoughby found several old
friends, some of whom had been his companions
in arms, and this circumstance induced him to
suspend his journey for a week. With the Hon.
Christopher G. Champlin, a member of Congress,
he had been very intimate in his youth, and the
renewal of that intimacy now gave them
reciprocal
pleasure.
In the mean time Amelia formed a very pleasing
acquaintance with his lovely neice, Miss Eliza
Mason. This amiable and interesting young
lady was addressed by a lover to whom she was
affianced, and the tenderest attachment existed
between them. The name of this happy youth
was Perry, an officer in the United States navy,
about twenty-four years old. To a manly
deportment
,
and decisive firmness of character, he
united an amiable disposition, unassuming
address
,
and prepossessing appearance. Though
early launched among the familiar scenes of naval
life, (and no where is familiarity more apt to be
licentious and encroaching) yet his native
gentility
and sober dignity of demeanor, had always
chastened without restraining the freedom of
intimacy
.
8
Moral excellence, high-minded courtesy,
and pure unsullied honor, were the sterling
ingredients
which composed his character.
George saw, appreciated, and loved. He felt
himself irresistibly drawn to a being whose soul
seemed the repository of every noble virtue; and
on retiring from his first interview, he exclaimed
to his father with enthusiasm, that man was
born, sir, for a Champion of Freedom.
If his first impression was thus favorable to the
object of his admiration, a few days' intimacy
heightened it to the warmest and purest
friendship
,
and George secretly wished that his father
had seen fit to place him also in the way of
acquiring
naval renown.
Lieut. Perry was actually descended, on the
maternal side, from the Wallaces, so celebrated
in the annals of Scotland, and he would have
borne the name of William Wallace, had not the
sudden death of a beloved uncle induced his
parents to change it.
His mother, though of Scotch extraction, was
born in Ireland, and married in the year one
thousand
seven hundred and eighty-four, to Raymond
H. Perry, esq. who had taken an active part, both
by sea and land, in the cause of American
freedom
.
This excellent woman had devoted herself
to the education of her children, and formed their
youthful minds to early habits of virtue and
religion
.
So successful had she been in these
attempts
,
that neither his thirst for glory, nor the
bustle of a naval life, were able to seduce the
mind of Lieut. Perry from the salutary
impressions
which he received in early youth.
At the age of fourteen he had entered the
service
as a midshipman, on board the General
Greene, then commanded by his father. When
that ship went out of commission he was
transferred
to a squadron destined for the
Mediterranean
,
where he served during the Tripolitan war.
His extreme youth prevented his having an
opportunity
of distinguishing himself; but the
faithfulness
and intelligence with which he discharged
the duties of his station, recommended him greatly
to the favor of his superior officers; whilst his
private virtues, and the manly dignity of his
deportment
,
commanded the friendship and respect
of his associates.
On returning from the Mediterranean, he
continued
sedulously attentive to his profession, and
though the reduction of the navy, and the neglect
into which it had now fallen, disheartened many
of the officers, and occasioned several to resign,
yet he determined to adhere to its fortunes,
confident
that it must, at some future period, rise to
importance. He now commanded the Revenge,
and was employed in cruising along the coast, to
enforce the embargo law.
Such was lieutenant Perry when introduced to
our back-woods travellers, and so assiduous
was he that the period of their stay in Newport
should be agreeably filled up, that scarce a day
or evening passed, without their joining some
party of amusement created by his influence, so
that the intended week was actually extended to
a fortnight. It was here that our young foresters
were first initiated into the sphere of genuine
refinement
,
and began to assume the fascinating
blandishments of polite life. But the
ground-work
was so excellent, that it rather imparted
grace to the embroidery, than received
attractions
from it.
After passing two weeks in the most agreeable
intercourse, our travellers, on the fourth of June,
bade their new friends an affectionate adieu, and
reached Providence the same evening. Here the
major had previously agreed, by letter, to spend
a few days with an old friend and
brother-soldier
,
who had been a fellow-laborer with him
through the whole of the arduous struggle for
American Independence. The name of this
veteran
was Allen, who had been early appointed
a first lieutenant in the revolutionary army, and
was actively engaged in most of the battles which
were fought during the war. He commanded the
Rhode-Island line of troops at the battle of
Saratoga
,
when he was advanced to the rank of
major; and, since the peace, had been appointed,
by the legislature of his state, brigadier-general
of militia. His lady was the governor's sister,
and possessed an amiable disposition, and
captivating
manners. The reception of Willoughby
was such as might be expected, after so long a
separation. While he chose to remain in town
with his children, it was insisted that the
general's
house should be their quarters, and nothing
was neglected that might conduce to the
happiness
of their situation.
The general's son, William Henry, who was
now on a short furlough to visit his friends, was
a lieutenant in the navy, and attached to the
frigate
United States, under the command of
commodore
Decatur. He was now, apparently,
about twenty-four years of age, with a
combination
of gallantry, grace, and intrepidity in his
character, that irresistibly attracted the heart of
George. Perhaps a more polished and polite
sailor never trod the deck of a ship. In the
hour of danger, he had already proved himself
calm, intrepid, and persevering; in private
intercourse
,
he was guarded, affable, and delicate.
Glory was the mistress of his soul, and he panted
for an opportunity to woo her in the cannon's
mouth.
Notwithstanding the present youth and
rusticity
of George Willoughby, there was
something
in his countenance and manners that
bespoke
a real greatness of soul; this was quickly
discerned by young Allen, and a cordial intimacy
was the consequence; which, short as it was,
kindled into a flame, a spark that had long been
smothering in the bosom of George. When
Allen recounted some of his adventures in the
Mediterranean, during the Tripolitan war, the
natural disposition of our hero would burst
through all restraint, and his enthusiasm draw
smiles from every spectator. O that I could
enter the navy! was then the first wish of his
bosom. But he knew that his father would listen
to no such proposal, until his education was
completed, and this consideration alone,
prevented
his making the request.
It had always been the intention of General
Allen, that Henry should receive a liberal
education
,
who, for this purpose, went through the
preparatory studies. He panted, however, for
more active life, and, notwithstanding the
remonstrances
of his parents, entered the navy, as
a midshipman, in the year eighteen hundred.
In three months after his appointment, he was
ordered on board the frigate George
Washington
,
[5]
[5]
See Port Folio, vol. iii. p. 2.
commanded by captain Bainbridge, to carry
8*
presents to the dey of Algiers. On his departure,
he wrote to his father, I now bid you a short
adieu; but, should it be the last, you shall have
the satisfaction to hear of my good conduct, in
my station, as an officer and as a gentleman.
This cruise was attended with peculiarity of
incident
.
The demand of the dey of Algiers, that
the frigate should be employed in carrying his
presents to the grand seignor at Constantinople,
and the unavailing reluctance and remonstrances
of captain Bainbridge, are circumstances
generally
known. It was the first time that the flag of
an American frigate had waved in the harbor of
Constantinople. The fine order of the ship, and
the excellent discipline observed amongst the
officers
and men, tended to impress very high ideas
of the American character, in a quarter of the
world were before it was unknown.
On the nineteenth of April, in the following
year, young Allen again hailed the verdant
landscapes
of his native country; and, while he was
solacing himself in the hope of once more
visiting
his family and friends, he was ordered on
board the Philadelphia, under the command of
captain Baron, to scour the Mediterranean sea
again, from whence he returned after a cruise of
fifteen months; and before the expiration of the
year eighteen hundred and six, had returned
from his fourth cruise in the same classical
regions
.
During these different voyages, he visited
many objects of curiosity, both of nature and
art. He ascended Mount tna, in company with
commodore Rodgers, and, in returning, they lost
their way amongst fields of lava, but were found
by the monks in the convents below. He
likewise
visited Mount Vesuvius, and the cities of
Herculaneum and Pompcia, besides many of the
public buildings in the different cities on the
shores of the Mediterranean.
In February, eighteen hundred and seven, he
received orders from government to join the
frigate
Chesapeake, commanded by captain Baron,
then fitting out at Washington, for carrying
supplies
to the Mediterranean squadron. He
remained
in Philadelphia while the ship was
preparing
for sea, during which time he was busily
employed in recruiting men for the service, and
then entered as third lieutenant.
At the time of the sailing of this ship, the
United
States were at peace with all the world, and
the Chesapeake was intended rather as a
store-ship
than a cruiser. Besides the supplies she
carried, she was much burthened with the luggage
of passengers, among whom were two ladies,
with their servants. Captain Baron was aware
that his ship was not in fit condition to proceed to
sea; but, trusting to the circumstance that the
country was in profound peace, he unfortunately
sailed, unprepared as he was, calculating that
he should be enabled, long before he reached the
European shores, to have his ship put in order.
What a mistaken, imprudent, fatal security!
Two British seventy-fours, the Bellona and
Triumph; the Leopard, carrying fifty guns, and
the Melampus, thirty-eightunder the command
of commodore Douglass, were lying in
Lynnhaven-bay
.
They were freely receiving, from
our country, supplies of every kind of which
they stood in need; they were partaking largely
of the hospitality of its inhabitants; yet, at this
moment, commodore Douglass held in his
possession
an order from his admiral, to take,
forcibly
,
out of the Chesapeake, a part of her
crew; and he was meditating to execute this
offensive
order, in a manner the most irritating to
our country, and the most derogatory to our
navy. Had the object of commodore Douglass
been simply to take the men, and to produce
the least possible irritation, he would, most
obviously
,
have followed the Chesapeake out to
sea with his whole force, and there would then,
perhaps, have been no reproach on the navy,
had she surrendered without firing a gun.
Commodore
Douglass dared not send the Melampus,
as she was a frigate of the same class with the
Chesapeake, and might, therefore, not have
succeeded
.
The Leopard was sent: she was of
force to insure to the British success, even had the
Chesapeake been in complete order; and yet the
force was not so overbearing but that the
Chesapeake
ought to have fought; and had she not
fought, and fought well, the navy would
have been
disgraced
.
The navy
was
disgraced. The Chesapeake
was boarded by an officer from the Leopard, with
a written demand, which the American
commandant
knew he must absolutely and positively
refuse
;
and which he did refuse, without, however,
making any preparation to support his refusal
with force. He should have detained the
boarding
officer, and ordered his men to beat to
quarters
.
A full half hour elapsed, from the receipt
of this demand before an answer was composed,
written, and copied, and in that time the ship
might have been nearly prepared for action. But
all the officers remained ignorant of the contents
of the note, and no preparation was made. The
first gun was fired from the Leopard before the
key of the Chesapeake's magazine was delivered
to the gunner. Allen was at the galley, and,
snatching a coal from the flames, fired the only
gun which was discharged, and which pierced the
ward-room of the Leopard. At that moment a
shot from the Leopard struck a man on the breast,
who fell at Allen's feet, covering him with blood,
and splinters of bones. One man had his leg
carried away, two an arm each, and two more
were wounded severelyfive out of the eight
whom Allen had collected at this gun.
The colours were then struck, by order of the
captain, who called his officers into the cabin,
and asked their opinions. Allen's answer was,
Sir, you have disgraced us!
Although three years had elapsed since this
event, young Allen could not speak on the
subject
with composure. In relating the circumstance
to George, he broke forth into the following
exclamation
:
To see so many brave men standing
to their quarters, amidst the blood of their
butchered and wounded countrymen, and hear
their cries, without the means of avenging them!
and when, in three minutes we
could
have
avenged
them! to have the flag of my country
disgraced
!
Was it for this that I had continued so
long in the service, contrary to the wishes of all
my friends! To be so mortified, humbled, cut
to the soul! Yes, to have the finger of scorn
pointing at me as one of the officers of the
Chesapeake
!
But do not think, my friend, that I feel
that I have not done my duty. Perish the
thought! I proudly feel that I would have willingly
given my trifling life, an offering for the wounded
honor of my country. But, when I act like
Baron, may I die, unpitied and forgotten, and no
tear be shed to my memory. May I lie on some
barren shore, and may my bones whiten in the
sun, be pelted by the pitiless storm, and may the
name of Allen be blasted with infamy.
At the request of the officers of the
Chesapeake
,
in a letter, drawn up by Allen, to the
secretary
of the navy, a court-martial was convened,
and, after a patient hearing, commodore Baron
was divested of his commission. On leaving the
ship, all the officers were called on deck to
witness
his departure, a respect always paid to the
commander, when entering or departing from his
vessel. He now left her, passing through a line
of officers: but no tear of regret was shed
every brow was contracted, every countenance
was stern; and captain Baron, beholding the
repulsive
looks of his officers, fainted.
Intrepidity, however, was not the only
excellence
in the character of lieutenant Allen; his
private affections were as warm as his public.
Though his mind was at times inflamed by a
sense of indignant sensibility, that prompted him
to pour into the ear of masculine confidence the
complaints of his lacerated mind, in his
intercourse
with the gentle circle that surrounded his
paternal hearth, his conversation was replete
with domestic tenderness and affection. When
in company with the fair, he could enter into all
the innocent levities of ordinary converse, and
seemed as anxious to veil his heroic and indignant
passions, as if this indulgence was criminal in
such intercourse.
Notwithstanding the ocean
mania
with which
George Willoughby was affected, by the
conversation
and manners of his new friend, it was
soon dissipated; for on the second evening of
their stay at the general's, the two old veterans
fought all their battles o'er again, and kindled
in George's bosom as ardent a desire to storm an
embattled parapet, as he had just before felt to
board a frigate from the yard-arm. A hero he
was resolved to beno matter where or how.
The last impression was in favor of the army.
In the course of the conversation, the name of
Andre was mentioned, and the general was
sensibly
affected. He had been entrusted with the
charge of that unfortunate but gallant officer,
while under sentence of death; and sat up with
him the whole night previous to his execution.
Andre conversed with him on a variety of
subjects
,
in which he uniformly spoke of the
American
character in terms of the strongest respect,
and expressed his gratitude for the kindness and
delicacy with which he was treated during his
confinement. So affecting was this interview to
Allen, that he could never relate the circumstance
without great emotion.

CHAPTER X.
BOSTON.
Cradle of Freedom! whose propitious birth
Was bless'd by Heaven, and hail'd with joy by earth;
Thy happy sons first hail'd her from the skies,
And bade the flame upon her altar rise,
Though tyrants threatened and their slaves reviled,
While merciless Heroes sought to slay the child,
Still undismayed, her banner she unfurl'd,
And gave a Nation to the admiring world.
Anon.
On
the eighth day of June, in the year one
thousand eight hundred and ten, Major
Willoughby
,
with his two children, entered the metropolis
of Massachusetts, after an absence of fourteen
years. I shall not attempt to detail the various
recollections which now crowded on his mind,
nor describe the sensations which they produced
in his bosom. He was silent and contemplative,
as the carriage rattled over the pavements of
Cornhill
,
while George and Amelia were animated
with present novelty, and anticipated enjoyment.
Their fatiguing journey was terminated, and all
its little perils forgotten, in the happy meeting of
long-parted friends.
Major Willoughby immediately commenced the
requisite arrangements respecting his children,
who were both placed under the care of their
uncle, and the necessary tutors provided for
finishing their education. The commencement,
at Harvard University, was to take place on the
twenty-ninth of August, and, on the nineteenth
of the following month, which would terminate
the vacation, George was to begin his collegiate
course of studies, provided his application, in
the mean time, should qualify him to pass the
customary
examination. After arranging these plans,
and spending a few weeks in Boston, the major
took an affectionate leave of his children and
friends, and returned, in safety, to
Mulberry-grove
.
The family, to which the reader is now about
to be introduced, and with whom our hero and
his sister resided, was of the first class in the
town of Boston. Mr. Cushing was a merchant
of very extensive connexions, and the golden
days of commercial prosperity had blest him
with an ample fortune; his wife was the most
amiable of women, and their daughter, Ellen,
every thing the fond parent could wish. She
was an only child, had acquired every
accomplishment
that a genteel education could bestow,
and, if she possessed a fault, it was the too free
indulgence of an uncommon vivacity.
George now applied to his studies with all his
former ardor, and so intense was his application,
that nothing else could divert his attention. The
entreaties of his uncle and aunt, the advice of
his sister, and the attractions of his volatile
cousin
,
all combined, could seldom entice him from
his books, or draw him into a party of pleasure.
The town amusements possessed no charms for
his studious and contemplative mind, for they
bore no similitude to his former recreations.
Whenever he did emerge from his closet, (or, as
Ellen chose to call it, his den) it was to fly far
from the ceaseless tumult that distracted his
attention
.
On the verdant banks of Charles-river,
hr could catch some traces of the paradise he had
left, pursue his meditations in quiet, and give
ample scope to his poetic fancy. Here he would
9
stroll for hours, watch the setting sun, sigh for
his harp, and think upon Catharine.
Amelia and Ellen were sometimes his
companions
in these rural excursions; but he more
frequently enjoyed them in solitude, with
Homer
,
Horace, or Plutarch in his hand.
Amelia
expressed her apprehensions for his health,
and his cousin was fearful for his brain; she called
him her hermit, her savage, and her Adonis, and
would gravely entreat him to become civilized,
humanized, and christianized. George
answered
her raillery with a smile, but continued
his favorite pursuits, until they were interrupted
by his removal to Cambridge.
A regular correspondence had been settled
between major Willoughby and his children, and
scarcely a week elapsed without a letter from
Mulberry-grove
,
filled with the most affectionate
advice
respecting their education and conduct in
life. From one of them I have been permitted
to make the following extract:
I am happy, my dear boy, to learn from
your last, dated at Cambridge, that you have at
length formally entered the first literary
institution
in the United States. In this new situation
you will doubtless feel and exhibit a little
awkwardness
at first; but this will gradually wear
away, until you find yourself perfectly at home.
I feel no fears for you on this head, and but few
on any other. Continue to cherish those
sentiments
of virtue and honor for which I have so
often commended you, and not only my hopes,
but my warmest wishes will be realized.
One thing, however, I feel it my duty to
observe
,
viz. that though there is no situation in life
entirely exempt from temptations, (because, we
are all born with more or less propensities to
evilthe sad effects of man's dreadful fall) yet
those you have hitherto had to contend with are
trifling, compared with what you must encounter
in the world, on which you are now entering.
It behoves you, therefore, to be ever on your
guard, nor suffer the citadel of virtue to be taken
by surprise.
In selecting your companions, and, above
all, in the choice of an intimate friend, too much
circumspection cannot be used. On this subject
I have already written much, but it is a matter of
such great importance, that it cannot be too often
nor too earnestly recommended. Reputation,
fortune
,
happiness, all depend upon it. A
thoughtless
or an imprudent choice, is the fatal rock on
which too many split. Before you take any one
to your bosom or admit him to your confidence,
be certain that he is neither an infidel nor a
libertine
.
Study his motives, his propensities, and
his temper; the affections of his heart, and the
occupation of his intellect. Become perfectly
acquainted with his disposition, and sift his
character
to the bottom. Should you find yourself
once deceived, let it double your circumspection,
and never parly with the devil after discovering
his cloven-foot.
There is one subject on which I have said
but little, and that is,
politics
. Your secluded
situation, I presume, has hitherto preserved your
mind from any undue prejudices against either
of the two great political parties which exist in
our country. But you are now moving in a
sphere in which you will be frequently called
upon to express a decided opinion on the subject.
This you may do without belonging to either
side. Preserve your independence, and never
forget
that there are good men in all classes, as well
as bad; that genuine patriotism exists in every
section of the Union, and is not the exclusive
virtue of any party, and that you may be a friend
and champion of Freedom, without wearing a
badge of political distinction. Possess opinions
of your own on all subjects, and express them,
when necessary, with moderation and firmness.
God has given you reason, and it will be an
unpardonable
abuse of his bounty, to let another
control it. Beware of prejudice and bigotry
they bespeak a weak mind; weigh with coolness
and deliberation the relative merits of every
question
before you pass a final decision, and never
suffer yourself to become the slave or the tool of
a sect or a party.
Remember the following:
Love your God above all beings, your
religion
above all things, your country above all
nations
,
your friends above all men, your family
next, and yourself last.
Whoever strictly adheres to these rules, and
shapes his conduct accordingly, must be a good
politician, and a good man, whatever be his
religious
or political creed; for
`His can't be wrong whose
life
is in the right.'
The farewell address of our beloved
Washington
,
read next to your Bible. Make that your
political creed, and you cannot err in your
political
conduct. `Frown indignantly on the first
dawning of an attempt to alienate any portion of
this country from the rest, or enfeeble the sacred
ties which now link its various parts.'
This is the language of that god-like man,
the friend of your father, and the father of his
country. To me, there is a charm in the name
of Washington that I can neither account for nor
describe. In the deepest solitude I love to repeat
it and dwell upon the sound; it is more
fascinating
to my ear than the sweetest music. An
elegant writer, in a work now before me,
expresses
his own feelings on the same subject in
the following words: `The character of that
wonderful
man, equally above the reach of detraction
and praise, is, literally,
novum monumentum in
terris
a new and unheard of
monument
on earth.
With the beams of glory playing around it, its
basis is an empire, its top is in the heavens. It
throws its effulgence on the remotest nations, and
is a beacon-light for the direction of virtuous
ambition
.
In contemplating an object so
stupendous
and dazzling, Panegyric becomes dumb,
Imagination abandons her search after imagery,
and Fancy throws aside her colors in despair.
The pen and the pencil were formed for common
purposesfor the portraying and decoration of
common subjects. But the character of
Washington
,
passing the widest boundaries of nature,
swells to a prodigy, and is all but miraculous.'
[7]
[7]
Editor of the Port Folio.
`No monarch, on his throne,' says Inchiquin,
`was ever so great as Washington in his
retirement
.'
A few words more on politics, and I have
done. Always bear in mind that the ruler of any
and every nation,
represents
, for the time being,
the Governor of the Universe, in his kingly
capacity
.
Never, therefore, be guilty of disrespect
9*
to this his
representative
character, whatever may
be your opinion of the man. Shun that politician,
of either party, who thinks it no impiety to
damn
the president: such a man is in grain a rebel, let
his external patriotism appear ever so
conspicuous
.
This remark applies to every
government
under heaven, but in a peculiar manner to
this free republic, where our rulers are appointed
by a majority of the ruled. The president of
the United States, therefore, not only represents,
in common with kings, the Governor of the
Universe
,
but he represents him conjoined to his
church on earth; for those citizens whose free
suffrages elect a ruler, stand in the same
relation
to that ruler that the christian church
does to its divine head; for, by their own free
suffrages do the regenerate choose Christ as their
king.
But though you should be induced to give a
decided preference to one or the other of our
political
parties, never enlist your passions in the
cause you espouse, for that would be like
commencing
a military operation with an
undisciplined
rabble of disorganizing outlaws and
traitors
:
your own defeat will be the certain
consequence
.
Harvard University is scarcely disrobed
of the habiliments of mourning, for the untimely
fate of a most promising youthan amiable, but
rash victim to the demon of party. The story of
young Austin is fresh in the recollection of all,
and is a melancholy comment on the weakness of
human nature, when unsupported by a true sense
of religion.
He was a student, like yourself, but in which
class I do not recollect; I only know that he
acquired great applause for his application and
proficiency. Some political newspaper squib,
of a personal nature, of which his father was
the avowed author, drew a challenge from the
offended party, (Selfridge, an attorney at law)
which being rejected by the elder Austin, the
latter was posted for a coward. Indignant at
this imaginary disgrace of his father, young
Austin flew to Boston, met the challenger on the
public exchange, and undertook to cane him on
the spot. Selfridge received a blow on the head,
and then shot his assailant through the heart, who
fell on the pavement, weltering in his blood, and
expired. Behold the effects of an intemperate
attachment to either party! Here was a young
man, cut off in the morning of life, with the most
flattering prospects around him, leaving a large
circle of relations and friends to lament the
disastrous
event. You may learn the particulars of
this awful tragedy from almost any member of
the university, or of your friends in Boston.
Perhaps you have already read the trial of
Selfridge
,
who was arraigned for manslaughter, and
acquitted. I found a copy among some books I
purchased while in Boston.
Malignant party spirit has been aptly
compared
to the
Bohon Upas
, or poison tree of Java,
and its influence and effects to the polluted
atmosphere
and sterile region which surrounds that
deadly tree. `It is not air, but the breath of
hell, teeming with desolation and horror. Its
soil produces nothing but noisome and poisonous
weeds, and is covered with the bleached bones
of its wretched victims. In the midst of this
garden of death stands the fatal tree, guarded by
the demon of destruction, whose touch deranges
heaven's noblest plan, perverts life's genial fluid
to corroding venom, and changes the healthful
form to a putrid mass of corrupted mortality.'
Thus the pestilent Upas, the hydra of trees,
Its boughs o'er the wilderness spreads,
And with livid contagion polluting the breeze,
Its mildewing influence sheds;
The birds on the wing, and the flowers in their beds,
Are slain by its venomous breath,
That darkens the noon-day with death,
And pale ghosts of travellers wander around,
While their mouldering skeletons whiten the ground.
[8]

Montgomery's Poems, page 167.
Shun, as you hope to prosper, this fatal
spot; let neither fame, wealth, nor rank, allure
you within the sphere of its baneful influence;
preserve your integrity and independence, and be
charitable to all men. Thus will you experience
a rich reward in the consciousness of deserving
one.
In my last, I forgot to communicate an
interesting
fact. In returning from Boston, I
travelled
by the way of Worcester, Albany, and
Buffalo; at the latter place, I embarked on board
a schooner, and came to Cleveland by water.
In passing through Auburn, a beautiful village
on the Owasco lake, I fell in company with a
gentleman, whose home is in the neighborhood
of judge Brown, the amiable quaker who dined
with us at Mulberry-grove (you may recollect)
about two years ago. The judge, as his
neighbor
informed me, enjoyed good health, and,
when he left the village, was
in full uniform, on
parade, at the head of his regiment!
He is
colonel of militia! A happy triumph of reason
and patriotism over the prejudices of early
education
.
Adieu.
CHAPTER XI.
A CRITICAL MOMENT.
The Handkerchief:the Handkerchief!
Shakepeare
.
At
Cambridge George found himself moving in
a new world, and his whole deportment became
gradually changed as he adapted himself to the
situation in which he was now placed. Like
Godwin's
Fleetwood, (and like almost every other
student of similar habits and disposition) the
savage
of Cayahoga soon became metamorphosed
into a classical buck; as he could not escape
the coxcombs of the University, he surrendered
himself into their hands with the best grace he
could, and selected one young person for a friend,
who kindly undertook his introduction into the
world.
But, like too many others, he was unfortunate
in his choice, for beneath a specious exterior, this
Thomas Sandford, his new friend, wore a corrupt
heart. He was three years older than George,
had lost his father at an early age, and was the
ruined victim of maternal indulgence.
The virtuous disposition, correct habits, and
ingenuous manners of George, could not long
escape the notice of his class-mates, and while he
thereby gained the esteem of a few, he became
the subject of derision with many. Among the
latter was Sandford himself, though he concealed
the sentiment under the mask of consummate
hypocrisy
.
He considered all religion as a farce,
and its votaries as mere actors in a drama,
assuming
a language and habit foreign to their real
character. In compelling his friend to relinquish
this garb, he thought he should confer on him a
most essential benefit. But aware of the strength
of early prejudices, he knew that great caution
and circumspection were to be employed in the
undertaking, but he also knew that if his efforts
were crowned with success, his triumph would be
worth the labor. To unmask the hypocrite, and
then hold him up to the derision of his associates,
was the object he contemplated, and to effect
which he put in requisition all the little ingenuity
of which he was master.
For this purpose, he sought every opportunity
of cultivating an acquaintance with his intended
victim, and of ingratiating himself into his favor,
until he could gain his entire confidence; he
entered
into his sentiments, flattered his taste, and
counterfeited the friend and the moralist with so
much success, that notwithstanding the caution of
his father, the unsuspecting honesty of George
was imposed upon; a stranger to deceit himself,
he was too generous to suspect it in others. He
felt grateful that a youth of young Sandford's
accomplishments
and correct deportment should
thus court his intimacy, and felt it a duty to make
every return in his power. He recollected the
advice of his dear father, to associate with none
but the good and the virtuous, and congratulated
himself on his good fortune in the choice he had
made. Almost every evening, during the winter,
was passed in each other's society.
Having thus succeeded, almost beyond his
hopes, in
deceiving
, Sandford had no doubt of
equal success in
seducing
. He began by
occasionally
expatiating on the pleasures of sense in the
most glowing and exuberant language he could
command, and took frequent opportunities of
reading
to him the poems of the voluptuous Moore, and
others who like him have prostituted their talents
in giving to the haggard looks of vice the most
exquisite
coloring and captivating softness. All this,
however, produced no other effect on George than
that of drawing from him his most solemn protest
against the immoral tendency of such productions,
and some demonstrations of surprise at the taste
of his friend.
The mother of Sandford resided in Boston, and
our hero consented to accompany him thither on
one of his weekly visits. It was in the twilight of
a moonless evening in May, when they crossed
the bridge, and quite dark before they reached
their place of destination.
A servant received them at the door, and
showed
them into an elegant parlour where a
middle-aged
lady was sitting, who rose to receive them;
and welcomed her dear Thomas with many
demonstrations
of pleasure. George was
introduced
by his friend, who then left the room, and
in a few minutes returned with two beautiful girls,
his sisters.
Our hero now found himself very agreeably
situated, and wondered within himself why all
the female world were not so civil, polite, and
condescending as the trio with whom he was now
conversing, and he more than once complimented
Mrs. Sandford on the blessings she possessed in
two such daughters. The sweetest smiles and
kindest words were the answers he received to
every observation he made. Excepting
Catharine
,
(thought he) Amelia, and Ellen, I have never
before seen such agreeable girls, and Mrs
Sandford
is certainly the most amiable of womenmy
aunt Cushing excepted.
In a short time supper was introduced and
invitingly
served up, when, by the kind interference
of his friend, George found himself seated at table
by the side of Maria, one of these pretty sisters.
The social glass went round, the conversation
became
lively, and the polite attentions of his fair
entertainers unremitting. As soon as their
repast
was finished, Sandford ordered more wine
for himself and his friend, while he requested
Maria to favor them with a few airs on the Piano
Forte. George earnestly seconded the request,
led her to the instrument, and listened to a sweeter
voice than he had ever heard, except Catharine's.
The subject was love, and the beautiful Maria
did it ample justice. George stood by her side,
and every tone reached his soul. The fair
performer
would occasionally accompany some
exquisite
cadence with a glance of tenderness from
her soft blue eyes, that made his every pulse throb
with an extatic sensation he had never before
experienced
.
He forgot himself, his friends, and
the worldforgot what he had drank, and
accepted
a bumper from the attentive Sandford
whenever offered. Wine, music, and beauty, all
combined to charm his senses into a delightful
trancehe was absorbed in a sweet delirium,
and knew not, cared not, when or how it would
terminate.
Maria rose from the instrument, and in
stepping
forward her foot caught in the carpet; she
must certainly have fallen, but for the fortunate
position of the bewildered George, who received
her in his arms. Her cheek was prest to his, and
her lovely breast throbbed against his wildly
palpitating
bosom. Her long hair fell from the comb
that had sustained it, and in flowing luxuriance
enveloped them both in a kind of vail. His hand
was in hers, she unconsciously prest it, and they
sunk on an adjacent sopha with their burning lips
glued to each other's.
The mother, sister, and Sandford, had
disappeared
.
George Washington Willoughby was in
the arms of a prostitute!
And must the fair fabric of virtue, so
industriously
erected by the best of parents, be in one
fatal moment destroyed? No. Though reason
slumbered, his guardian angel was awake, and
by what casuists would falsely call
accident
,
directed
his eye to the floor, where lay the
handkerchief
of Catharine Fleming, with the fortunate
G staring him full in the face.
With something like a shrick he sprang from
the guilty embrace of the astonished syren,
snatched the token of his Catharine from the
floor, and dropping on his knees ejaculated
with convulsive energy, Almighty God. I thank
thee! Then seizing his hat, darted into the
street, and left the town.
There is no such thing as
accident
or
chance;
never wasnever will be. Every occurrence
in the world, however trifling or
accidental
it may
appear
, is brought to pass by some cause
originating
in the spiritual world. All contingencies
or accidents, usually ascribed to
chance
or
fortune
,
are of divine providence, which operates in
such an invisible and incomprehensible manner,
for the sole purpose of preserving man in a state
of perfect liberty and freedom, so that he may
either attribute them to Providence or to chance.
If Providence always acted in a visible and
comprehensible
10
manner, man would be
compelled
,
from this sensible appearance, to acknowledge it.
and yet he is such by nature, that in his life and
conduct he would contradict it. This is the
reason
that miracles have so seldom wrought
conviction
on the human mind.
Our not possessing discernment sufficient to
trace the connexion of those minute links which
unite the chain of more conspicuous events, is
no argument against the existence of such
connexion
.
One end of the chain is only visible to us,
the other is in the spiritual world.
It was a circumstance of no apparent
consequence
,
scarcely worth recording, that an agitated
female should take a few wrong stitches in a piece
of cambric; and thereby produce a letter but little
differing in form from the one she intended to
mark; yet, trifling as it may appear, that little
letter was the instrument of Providence in saving
her dearest friend from embarking on a sea of
guilty pleasures, where none escape shipwreck,
and few eternal destruction.
It would perhaps be doing injustice to the
reader's
penetration to inform him that our hero had
not
been introduced at Mrs. Sandford's, but to one
of those temples of pleasure which disgrace every
populous town. This scheme of villany had
been long hatching in the mind of Sandford, who
was confident of its success. The weak
indulgence
of his mother supplied him with whatever
money he wanted, and that was a sufficient
passport
to houses of this description, and removed
every difficulty in the arrangement of this
deep-laid
plan of seduction. His mother and sisters
were personated by the most frail of their sex.
who had previously studied the parts they were
to perform, and the managers left the stage when
they saw the catastrophe of the drama at hand.
Sandford retired with his paramour chuckling at
his success, and anticipating the triumph which
awaited him.
Maria was almost frantic with rage, on seeing
her prey escape from the silken snare which had
been so artfully woven. She had anticipated a
rich harvest of gain from the artless
novice
, and
could not brook her disappointment. So much
confidence had she in her personal charms, that
a doubt of success had never crossed her mind;
what then must have been her mortification at
seeing those charms rejected with such coldness
and contempt, at the moment when she thought
them triumphant. She cursed George for a fool,
and pursued him to the door, but he had vanished.
For the part she had acted, Sandford had
promised
a liberal reward, and this she resolved not
to forfeit by an impolitic report, and therefore
retired
alone to her chamber. Sandford, who
entered
the parlour soon after, had no doubt but his
friend had accompanied her, and at a late hour
departed for his mother's, clated with a pleasure
which devils alone might envy.
George was not acquainted with this part of
the town, but ran on, regardless of his course,
without once venturing to look behind him. When
he became a little more composed, he slackened
his speed, and began to reflect on the incidents of
the evening. Never before had he reflected on his
conduct with pain, but now, the picture filled him
with despair. Bewildered with the wine he had
drank, he knew not precisely of what he had been
guilty, but a general idea of impropriety pervaded
his mind.
What have I done! exclaimed he, smiting
his foreheadhow have I acted! I was a guest
in the family of my friend, who treated me like
their own son, and how shamefully have I repaid
their kindness and hospitality! how basely
abused
their confidence! To get intoxicated, and then
attempt to corrupt the honor of an innocent artless
girl, who confided in me as the friend of her
brother
!
O my dear father! I am unworthy your
love! AmeliaCatharineit would break your
hearts to know it. How can I look my injured
friend in the face? he will read my meditated
guilt and despise the wretch who could be
tempted
to abuse his confidence. How damning are
the effects of drunkenness.
Absorbed in such reflections as these, he
pursued
his solitary way; a watchman directed him
to Cambridge-street, he crossed the bridge,
arrived
at the College about midnight, and for the
first time retired to bed unhappy.
CHAPTER XII.
AN EXPLANATION.
Why should the sacred character of virtue
Shine on a villain's countenance? Ye powers;
Why fix'd you not a brand on Treason's front
That we might know to avoid perfidious mortals.
Den. Iphig.
For
several days our hero was thoughtful and
dejected, avoided all society as far as was
compatible
with his situation, and above every thing
dreaded a private interview with Sandford. The
latter, who was now studying how to publish his
imaginary triumph so as to produce the most sport
in the College, saw the embarrassment of George,
but imputed it to the wrong cause. He had given
the abandoned Maria positive instructions to
inform
her lover of his real situation, before she
suffered him to leave her arms. This he was
prompted to do by a regard for the honor of his
family, not doubting but the night of rapture he
had procured for his friend, would effectually
atone for the deception he had used. George's
present shyness was therefore extremely natural
in a
novice
, one too who had ever been zealous in
condemning the vice into which he had now been
initiated; but it would speedily wear off as
sinning
became more familiar. He was perhaps
ashamed that his weakness was known to his
friend. It would all help to increase the sport he
was preparing for the class, though his own
agency
was to appear entirely accidental.
Such was the reasoning of this youthful
libertine
,
to confirm which he visited George in his
room, and invited him to renew his visit; who
declined the proposition with an earnestness that
somewhat disconcerted the inviter.
My
mother
and
sisters
will always be glad to
see you, said Sandford, with a look and emphasis
which he thought would be understood, but which
the embarrassment of George prevented his
observing
.
I have no reason to doubt it, from my former
reception.
I hope you were agreeably entertained, said
Sandford, with an arch inquisitive look.
Too much so, answered George, and he
checked himself. Nothing was lacking that
could contribute to my happiness. But I cannot
repeat the visit; because
10*
Come, come! my dear Willoughby,
interrupted
his insinuating seducerforgive your
Sandford an error (if you will call it such) which
arose from his friendship alone. Heaven is my
witness that I had nothing but your happiness in
view, and you confess that you
was
happy. Let
the end sanctify the means.
I impute no blame whatever to you, replied
George; I am confident that your motives were
generous, and I
know
that my reception was kind.
I repeat that I
was
happyvery happy. But
every leisure moment in future will be devoted
to my studies.
George was now convinced that his friend had
either not noticed his particular attentions to
Maria, or else had different notions of propriety
from himself. This consideration afforded him
some relief, but at the same time gave him
considerable
surprise. Had Sandford embraced
Amelia Willoughby on a first interview, kissed
her, fallen on a sofa with her in his arms, and
profaned her pure bosom with a licentious hand,
drunk or sober, George would have knocked him
down. But Sandford had left the room-and so
had the rest! How came they to leave the room?
Was not the conduct of Maria very different from
what he would have approved in
his
sister under
similar circumstances? Had she not made some
undue and improper advances? That could not
be true, or her worthy mother must have observed
it, and would most certainly have reproved her.
He had heard them spoken of as a very
respectable
family. But why had not his rude and abrupt
departure drawn some inquiries from his friend?
All was doubt and uncertainty; the whole scene
was but imperfectly remembered, and George was
bewildered in a labyrinth of conjecture.
He was awakened from this reverie by
Sandford's
renewing his request; which he did in
language
that filled George with the most unfeigned
astonishment:
What, my dear friend, can be your
objections
?
You have passed the Rubicon you so
much dreaded, and still exist in health and safety.
Or to use one of your bible figures, you have
tasted the forbidden fruit, and are yet alive to
confess its sweetness and the
happiness
it yielded.
Why not now eat your fill? If
tasting
incurs the
penalty,
cating
cannot increase it. Away then
with these shackles of priest-craft, and let us be
happy in the way which God intended.
George had never recoiled from a rattle-snake,
in the wilds of Ohio, with such an instinctive
abhorrence
as he now shrunk from Sandford, for he
could only understand him as inviting the
dishonor
of his own sister, whose
lips
he thought
were meant by the forbidden fruit he had tasted.
He was for a moment struck dumb with
amazement
,
and then exclaimed
Couple not the name of Deity with so impious
a sentiment! O Sandford! how have I been
deceived
in you! Surely, surely, such cannot
be your serious opinion. You jest with your
friend!
Indeed I do not, replied Sandford, these
are my real sentiments, and I am greatly
deceived
if you do not shortly adopt them yourself.
Never! never! exclaimed George with
increasing
earnestness, I must first be lost indeed.
Think what a scene of wickedness and misery
would be produced by their general adoption;
this fair world would become a theatre of the
wildest confusion and disorder. Where could
you imbibe such pernicious maxims?
Call them not pernicious, said Sandford,
when their end is delight. Is there not
interwoven
,
with our very existence, an aversion to
pain, and a love of pleasure? Why then should
we act in opposition to these propensities? Is
not their very existence a sufficient proof that we
should obey their dictates? A contrary opinion
is derogatory to that Being who implanted them in
our breasts, unless you consider him as a tyrant,
delighting in the pain of his creatures.
Your premises are false, cried George,
and therefore all the arguments that can be raised
upon them must fall to the ground. Our passions
never came from God.
To what other source can they owe their
existence
?
asked Sandford. All things proceed
from God, and by him alone they are and they
were created. Pray explain yourself.
With the Holy Scriptures for my guide,
replied
George, I will undertake it. Man was
originally created in the image and likeness of
his Maker, who blest him, and pronounced him
good
. His mind was then a paradisical garden,
planted by Omnipotence himself, and abounding
with the most delectable fruits of love and
wisdom
,
continually refreshed by a never-ceasing
stream of life and mercy. The divine fountain
of good, whence all his happiness flowed, was
the supreme object of his love, and his neighbor
was regarded as his second self.
But, being endowed with a
free volition
, he
possessed the power of transferring this love to
inferior objects, and, in process of time, the
unhappy
transfer was gradually effected. From
adoring the
fountain
, he began to contemplate
the
stream
, till forgetting its source, he madly
imagined it originated in himself. Self-love
succeeded
,
and, like a wily serpent, seduced his
affections, corrupted his judgment, and insinuated
the
forbidden
idea of self-sufficiency. This was
that accursed fruit which he had been prohibited
from tasting. `Eat,' said the serpent, `and
imagine thyself a god.' Man ate, and knew his
Creator no more.
The dreadful consequence was a total
perversion
of all the good he had received.
Conjugal
love degenerated into lust; self-preservation
was debased to self-love, and self-love reduced
to selfishness; innocent enjoyments became guilty
intemperance, prudence was perverted to
suspicion
,
and economy to covetousness; manly
firmness
sunk to wilful obstinacy; generous emulation
descended to envy, and envy produced wrath,
malice, hatred, revenge, and murder. In short,
the love of good which had been implanted by
Heaven in his soul, was adulterated, perverted,
and transformed into the love of evil. Every
affection
that had been given to promote his
happiness
,
was changed
by himself
into a lawless
passion
, productive of the keenest misery. Thus
our passions were never bestowed by God, but
are the perversion of good affections, which were
given to make us happy. `Evil, be thou my
good,' said man, and evil became his life.
Such was the fall of man; and the love of
evil, thus acquired, has descended from father to
son, in regular succession, while each generation
has increased its magnitude and malignity by
inventions
of their own
except where its hereditary
course has been arrested by the work of
regeneration
.
To increase man's ability for the
performance
of this work, to instruct him in its nature,
and to assist him in the process, was the object
of our Saviour's mission on earth.
Away, then, with that contemptible
sophistry
which would persuade us that our passions
were implanted in us by God, and that we must
consent to remain their passive vassals, instead
of striving to control and govern them.
Sandford smiled rather contemptuously at the
gravity and earnestness with which George
delivered
this harangue, and then replied: You
were undoubtedly designed for the pulpit,
Wilioughby
,
and I hope to live to see you ordained.
But
your
sophistry beats mine all hollow. Pray
tell me what you mean by
the love of evil
descending
from father to son?
I'll bet two to one that
there is not a clergyman in the state who ever
dreamt of so curious an idea, and I feel an
irresistible
desire to hear it explained. Gratify me,
if you please.
I will endeavor to make myself understood,
replied George, with his usual good nature. In
the present degenerate state of our natures, we
are more prone to evil than to good; this is a
truth which no one can deny who believes the
Scriptures. These bad propensities can only be
conquered and destroyed by a continued struggle
against them, and some are wise enough to
engage
in this mental warfare, with sufficient zeal
and sincerity to effect that desirable object; for,
whenever this contention with our internal
enemies
is resolutely persisted in, Heaven always
crowns our humble efforts with complete success.
I mean, if we apply to Heaven for assistance
but never without. This is what I call
regeneration
.
If these propensities to evil are thus
effectually
eradicated from the minds of a young
connubial
pair, previous to their union, their happy
offspring will be much less susceptible of similar
temptations. For as
the soul of every child is as
much the offspring of the parent's soul, as its body
is of the parent's body
, all dispositions, inherent
in the soul, must descend from the parent to the
offspring. It is this hereditary evil, thus
descending
,
and continually accumulating, that has made
this world what it now is, a scene of wars, hatred,
cruelties, thefts, murders, and every other crime.
Were not these hereditary propensities to
evil, now and then arrested in their descent, by
the reformation and regeneration of the few who
are wise enough to see the necessity of such a
change, the whole human race would, ere this,
have been destroyed by the monstrous
accumulation
.
Thus, sir, have I, briefly as possible,
endeavored
to comply with your request. The
sentiments I have exprest, were inculcated by the
best of parents, who has nothing but my welfare
in view, and who has never yet put a restraint
on a single inclination of my heart, that was
compatible
with its future peace.
Sandford here broke out into a broad laugh,
and George requested to be made acquainted with
the cause of his unreasonable mirth.
That the son of such a parent, endowed with
such strict precepts of piety, and professing such
elevated sentiments of virtue, should pass a night
in a brothel! Ha! ha! ha!
A clear perception of the whole truth, now,
for the first time, flashed like lightning on the
mind of George. Had he obeyed the first
impulse
that followed this conviction, the serpent
had been dashed from a third-story window into
the College yard; our hero's personal prowess
would have found no difficulty in the undertaking;
but he had been taught to examine every doubtful
impulse by the light of the understanding, and
one moment restored his calmness.
Mr. Sandford, said he with great solemnity,
the only punishment that I shall condescend to
inflict on you for your diabolical treachery, is, that
of depriving you of an imaginary triumph. I did
not remain in the place to which your fiend-like
artifice had conducted me, two minutes after you
left the room, but escaped as innocent as I entered
it. Of this you may be convinced by enquiring.
So, sir, the triumph is mine, and is the effect of
those paternal precepts which you have the
hardihood
to ridicule.
Sandford was thunderstruck at this
intelligence
;
but assumed composure enough to ask in
a tone of low irony
And pray,
parson Willoughby
, what other
good precept has this dear parent taught you?
One more, which I shall immediately put in
practice, answered George, with offended
dignity
,
and that is, to hold no parley with the devil
after I have once discovered his cloven-foot.
So saying, he opened the door of his room,
and added, in a tone quite new to his guest,
Avaunt! thou imp of darkness! and never again
dare profane this room with thy hateful presence,
nor pollute my atmosphere with thy contaminated
breath. Start!
In my own time, sir! answered Sandford,
as he assumed a menacing attitude, and in the
next moment he lay prostrate in the hall, with his
senses bewildered by the sudden transition.
George closed his door, while the fallen hero
thought it most prudent to slink to his own room,
and there plan some scheme of vengeance, in
the execution of which, his own personal safety
would not be jeopardized. But, before that
scheme could be brought to maturity, he was
obliged to withdraw from the University, to avoid
being publicly expelled, with two others, for a
riot in which they had been engaged.
CHAPTER XIII.
FEMALE SMALL TALK.
Trifles, light as air.
Shakspeare
.
A few
days after the foregoing event, a
package
of letters arrived from Mulberry-grove,
directed
to Mr. Cushing, among which was one for
Amelia, from her friend Catharine, and another
from major Willoughby to his son, who had just
arrived in town, to spend the spring vacation,
which lasted two weeks from the fifteenth day of
May. Catharine's epistle was couched in
affectionate
terms, and bespoke the sincerest
friendship
,
in a style peculiarly chaste and correct.
Towards the conclusion, she gave a description
of several new neighbors that had settled around
them, noticed many public improvements,
mentioned
that their new house was completed and
11
furnished, and concluded with lamenting the
absence
of her friend Amelia, and expressing many
wishes for her speedy return. George listened
in the most anxious suspense, while his sister was
reading this letter, and heard the usual
conclusion
without the least reference to himself.
Is that all? exclaimed he, as Amelia was
folding the paper.
Why, is not that long enough for a female?
said his sister, with a smile; what more could
you possibly contrive for her to say?
O, nothing, answered her brother, with a
sigh, and walked whistling to the window.
Aye! here is a
postscript
, said Amelia, and
George was at her elbow in an instantbut I
confess that I cannot understand it. Perhaps
you possess some
key
to unlock its meaning.
George snatched the letter from her hand, and
read
When you see your brother, tell him that his
harp is safe, and still tuned to the
key
of G, as he
left it. My grandfather assures me that I have
made considerable proficiency in learning to
play: the only air, however, which I can execute
tolerably, is `
Yes or No
.' Inform him, also,
if you please, that my
bird
has never yet returned,
as he assured me it would, although I frequently
dream that I have him in my bosom. Young
Logan was here about a month since, and
appeared
quite dejected at the loss of his friend and
preserver. He told your father that George
would forget all
he
had taught him, which he
considers
of much more real importance than all his
book-learning. So you must caution your
brother
to
forget nothing
that he has once learnt, and
least of all, the
letters of his gamut
.
George
did
possess a
key
to unlock its meaning
it was the key of
G transposed from C,
and
it vibrated in unison with the tenderest fibre of
his heart; he unconsciously prest the paper to
his lips, and his sister smiled.
Are you
giving
or
receiving
, my Adonis of the
woods? exclaimed his cousin Ellen. George
did not understand her, and she put into his
hands the New-York Columbian, where he read
the following:
GIVING AND RECEIVING.
The suppliant departed, while gratitude's tear
In his joy-beaming eye was suspended;
My heart bounded light, for my Mary was near,
Who thus the donation commended:
The bosom which softens at Misery's wound,
And proffers the balsam to heal him,
With the glow of contentment must joyfully bound
And such is the breast of my Selim.
But which, I exclaimed, as the fair one I prest,
While her eye with affection was brightened.
Receiver or donor, which think you most blest?
Whose joy by the action most heightened?
The being, she answered, you saved from despair,
Who tastes, by the sudden reversion,
Of exquisite bliss a proportionate share
To the depth of his recent immersion.
Her answer was sweetened with love's nectared kiss,
And my breast with the transport was heaving.
As I owned, with a sigh, that though
giving
was bliss,
It was faint to the joy of receiving.
And do you think, George, that a kiss would
adhere to that paper during a journey of six
hundred
miles? asked Amelia; If, however, there
was one deposited in that letter, it must of course
be my property, and I insist upon your restoring
it instantly. Therethat's a good boy. But
wont your cousin Ellen be jealous?
George called her a mad-cap, and saluted his
cousin.
There are other young ladies in the room,
observed Ellen.
But I dare not presumesaid George,
hesitating
and blushing.
Dare not presume to treat the ladies with
neglect, cried Ellen, and bestow no partial
favours in this company.
The young ladies tittered, and George felt an
additional glow in his face.
O the dear little lump of modesty!
exclaimed
the ever gay Ellen. Why, George,
you must come oftener to this polite metronolis,
and teach us the art of blushing. The ladies will
be infinitely obliged to you, as it will save a world
of cosmetics.
I fear I should lose the art myself, by
attempting
to teach it, replied George, a little
reassured
.
But why does my cousin wish to
revive
so antiquated a fashion?
Merely to keep you back-woods-men in
countenance. But do tell me if there can be any
roses in that dismal part of the world since you
and Amelia left it; for it is my opinion that you
two have robbed madam Nature of all her
carnation
in
that part of her territory at least.
Our complexions are the result of a healthy
climate and pure atmosphere, answered George;
but the ladies of Boston would there be taken
for spectres.
O the brute!
Of a super-angelic order, cousin, of course.
But we have strangely deserted the subject,
cried Ellen, rising, and leading her cousin
forward
to the two visiting ladies. There, sir, I
command you, in the name of gallantry, beauty,
and love, to treat all this good company alike;
and now disobey me on your peril!
But will it not be rude? asked George, with
an earnestness that made them all laugh.
Very rude, replied his sister, to neglect
it. Ellen, you will have to polish the young
savage.
It was a bliss to which I thought it
presumption
to aspire, said he, as his lips met those of
the fair strangers.
Born for our use, you live but to oblige us,
exclaimed Ellen.
The young ladies, whom George had been
thus compelled to salute, were the daughters of
judge Palmer, a gentleman of no inconsiderable
notoriety as a lawyer and politician. The eldest,
whose name was Harriet, was about eighteen
years old, not remarkably handsome, but famed
for her filial affection and domestic virtues.
Sophia
,
her sister, was three years younger, a pert
little miss, of considerable beauty, and very
vain. I have been thus particular in introducing
them to the reader, because he will meet them
again, if he has patience to prosecute the journey
of this history a few stages more. If not, he
must be content to drop their acquaintance here,
and bid them an eternal adieu.
And now, cried Amelia, you are not
aware of the favor you have conferred on me. I
knew not what in the world to fill my paper with,
in answering Catharine's letter, and you have
furnished me with a subject.
In what manner? asked he.
11*
Why, I can now tell her, in the first place,
that I
have
seen my brother, and told him what
she desired; and, in the next place, that he is in
a very high
key
, (say G in alt.) and in the third
place, that he studies very hardto please the
ladies; and fourthly and lastly, that he kisses
them all at the first interview. Is not there a
subject
for a letter?
Amelia! you will not write any such thing,
said George, in a tone of alarm that much
diverted
the ladies.
Wont I? You see then!
Make
me
your friend, cried Ellen, and I
will furnish you with a talisman, that will exact
the most implicit obedience from your sister.
What can that be?
Thisonly look, and she began counting
her fingersM,O,R,S,E.
Amelia was visibly embarrassed, and blushed
very deeply.
See! see! exclaimed Ellenbehold its
wonderful effects! Whenever that girl threatens
you again, you have nothing to do but what I
have just shown you, and mum is the word, she
is dumb directly.
How you run on, cousin Ellen, cried
Amelia
;
my brother will think you crazy.
George knew not what to think, and was just
going to request an explanation, as the door
opened, and a gentleman entered with the air and
ease of an old acquaintance.
You know the old proverb, exclaimed
Ellen.
There are so many old proverbs, replied
the gentleman, that I may not be fortunate
enough to hit upon the one to which the facetious
Ellen alludes.
Well, I shall not assist you, said she, only
we were just speaking of you as you made your
appearance. Mr. Willoughby, give me leave to
introduce, to your most particular acquaintance,
Mr. Morsenot the geography maker. Mr.
Morse, this is Mr. George Washington
Willoughby
,
the only son of major Edward Willoughby,
and brother to Miss Amelia C. Willoughby, heir
apparent to all his father's estate, real and
personal
,
together with the sword of Washington.
Nay, do not be alarmed, sir, he will only inherit
half the said estate, having generously agreed to
transfer the other half to his dearly beloved sister,
the aforesaid Amelia C. Willoughby, on the day
of her espousals with Mr. Somebody, which
event, we understand, is to take place some
time in the month of December next, in the
year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
and eleven.
O you inconscionable babbler! exclaimed
Morse, I wish that my new friend here would
find a curb for that tongue.
It must not be a matrimonial curb, I assure
you, replied Ellen; I could talk a husband to
death every fortnight. Besides, that fellow is a
savage, just out of the wilderness, where he left
a beautiful unfinished work, entitled, the `
Wild
Irish Girl
,' which he knows all by heart; besides
several modern songs, among which is that of
`Kate of Colerain.' And even his dearly
beloved
sister, the aforesaid Miss Amelia C.
Willoughby
,
is so much of a savage, that she is
always
talking about one Logan, and it would not
surprise me, in the course of two or three years,
to see a couple of papooses on her back, unless
some civilized christian will condescend to take
her himself.
Peace! my dear cousin, if you love me,
cried Amelia, and do not compel me to leave
the room.
Not for the world, Amelia, and if you threaten
it againCousin George, exhibit the talisman
I gave you.
Excuse me Ellen, a generous conqueror will
never refuse quarter when it is called for.
Well, I am sure that no one can impeach my
generosity. When you begged so hard to salute
these ladies, sir, did I not at length give you
leave, though will extreme reluctance?
You will allow me the same liberty, I hope,
Miss Ellen? said Morse.
No, hang me if I do, replied she, because
your request springs from interested motives.
Tea was here introduced, and this trifling
suspended
;
but George had heard enough to interest
his curiosity; he, therefore, after tea, retired
with his aunt, and received the following
information
:
Mr. Morse was a young man of respectable
connexions, and the proprietor of a very
lucrative
manufacturing establishment; an intimate
acquaintance, and great favorite of the family,
and, for the last two months, since his return
from Europe, the professed admirer of Amelia,
at whose request Mr. Cushing had written to her
father on the subject of his proposals. Major
Willoughby's answer had just been received, and
was to this effect: that the inclinations of his
children, in a matter of so much importance to
their happiness, should never be arbitrarily
controlled
,
nor in any manner influenced except by
friendly advice; that he had perfect confidence
in the prudence of his daughter, and in the
wisdom
and friendship of her present protectors;
was well satisfied with their recommendation of
the lover, and concluded with a promise of
attending
the celebration of the nuptials, if they
should be deferred until the month of December
following.
George felt perfectly satisfied with this
arrangement
,
and returned to the parlor with his aunt.
The Miss Palmers had departed, and the subject
was now discussed, without restraint, by this
happy little family party, the whole of whom
expressed
their pleasure for the promised
attendance
of the major at the felicitous event. The
transported lover was impatient to pay his duty
to so kind a parent.
I can easily perceive, cried Ellen, which
will prove the most affectionate and dutiful son,
the christian or the savage. There is my cousin
George who has trifled away two hours here,
with a letter from his father in his pocket, and
the seal is not broken, and yet he is so fond of
reading letters, that he snatches other people's
out of their hands, and kisses the postscript.
The accusation was just. In attending to his
sister's letter, he had entirely forgotten his own,
and unconsciously deposited it in his
pocket-book
.
He now obtained leave, and perused it
without delay, after which, at the request of the
family, he read it aloud. The subject was his
sister's projected marriage, and his father's
intended
visit, with this additionSuch an
arrangement
,
my son, may save you the fatigue
and expense of a journey to this place, and the
loss of much useful time, which, I think, you can
feel no inclination to incur, but for the pleasure
of meeting your father, and the delay of a few
months will heighten that pleasure to both of us.
Should you obtain leave to make this journey, it
would occupy at least three months. I would
recommend
,
therefore, that you pass the autumn
vacation at your uncle Cushing's in Boston, and
return to College as soon as it expires.
And now, cried Ellen, I have some hopes
of you; for, if we can keep you from the forest
another year, I think you will make some
progress
in civilization, that is, if you will leave
your books at Cambridge. My papa shall
purchase
a harp, and you shall teach me to play,
and I will sing
yes
or
no
, just as you direct me,
and you shall call me Kate, and I will answer
`arrah! now, my dear honey!' and we will be
as happy as the day is long. Now, wont you,
my dear cousin?
A recommendation from his father was the same
as a command, to George. He was thinking of
Catharine, and another year's absence, while his
giddy cousin rattled on, unattended to; but, at the
conclusion of her rhapsody, she patted him on
the cheek, and compelled him to answer, Born
for your use, I live but to oblige you.
Apropos! exclaimed his cousinthis
evening, Cooper plays Zanga, for his own
benefit
,
and it is his last appearance for the season.
The hint was understood, and the whole party
adjourned to the theatre.
CHAPTER XIV.
MORE NEW CHARACTERS.
That which Alexander sigh'd for,
That which Csar's soul possess'd,
That which heroes, kings, have died for,
Glory!animates my breast.
Montgomery
.
During
the vacation, George resided at his
uncle's as his father had proposed; but was no
longer the
solitaire
that his volatile cousin
represented
him. He left his books at Cambridge,
and cheerfully joined in every innocent scheme of
pleasure and amusement that was proposed, while
Ellen congratulated him on his progress towards
a state of
civilization
, and gravely undertook to
instruct him in the important mysteries of
etiquette
and the
beau monde
. He goodnaturedly humored
her in all her directions, consented to take private
lessons of Turner in the sublime science of
dancing
,
and soon became expert at the small sword,
under the tuition of Haussey.
But notwithstanding the charming frivolity
of Ellen Cushing, and her affected aversion to
books and bookworms, she was herself a good
English scholar, could read and speak the French
language fluently, and spent considerable time in
her library.
In one part of her playful proposition to
George, she was serious, and that was to become
his pupil on the harp, for which purpose the
instrument
had been actually procured; but being
already a proficient on the piano, and not
possessing
all that patient perseverance which is
necessary to acquire a difficult art, she soon
abandoned
the design, returned to her piano, and
relinquished the outlandish instrument to her
tutor, who neither felt nor expressed any regret
at the arrangement.
With all Ellen's affected cheerfulness, however,
she was not happy. Cupid had inflicted a deep
and incurable wound in her bosom, which rankled
there without hope, and without relief. I am
here imparting to the reader a secret with which
the dearest friend of Ellen was unacquainted.
The object of her affection, was her father's
chief clerk, William Orville, a young
gentleman
deservedly beloved by all who knew him.
Brought up almost from infancy together, Ellen
and William had ever felt the purest friendship
for each other, which had gradually ripened into
a more tender passion in the breast of the gentle
fair one. William was a poor orphan boy, and
jealously sensible of his dependent situation, set
a strict guard over his affections as soon as he
felt any symptoms of their aspiring to a mark
which he thought so far beyond his reach. He
was now twenty-three years of age, and had just
returned from England, where he had been
employed
above two years as Cushing's
commercial
agent.
When he and Ellen again met, more than ever
he felt the necessity of watching his heart, for she
now burst upon his dazzled view in a blaze of
finished beauty, and he could have almost
worshipped
her as a deity. But his unassuming
disposition
dared not admit the idea to cross his
mind, that Ellen was within his reach. Such
happiness is not for Orville, he would sometimes
exclaim; the
rich
alone can reasonably hope
to obtain such a prize. Were I to presume so far
as to speak to
her
of love, her friendship, with
which I am now blest, would be forfeited for ever.
Down! down! presumptuous heart! be content
with friendship, and look lower for love.
Poor Orville! Even while he was indulging
such melancholy suggestions, Ellen was only
restrained
by that self-respect which so properly
belongs to the sex, from throwing herself into his
arms.
She never told her love,
But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
Prey on her damask cheek.
Indeed, rumor had whispered to her ear, that
Orville was actually lavishing his attentions on
Harriet Palmer, a young lady to whom the reader
has already been introduced; but this, like many
other tales of that loquacious deity, was entirely
destitute of foundation, for Harriet's heart had
long taken up its abode in the manly breast of
Ellen's cousin Aylwin, and throbbed for him alone.
This young gentleman commanded one of his
uncle's ships in the London trade, and as he was
daily expected home, it may not be improper to
make the reader acquainted with him before he
arrives.
John Cushing Aylwin was the son of Thomas
Aylwin, esq. and nephew of the Hon. William
Cushing, one of the judges of the supreme court
of the United States.

His father, previous to
the revolution, was a merchant in Boston, and,
at the time of the siege of that town, retired to
Quebec with his wife, to whom he had been then
recently married. It was in this city, at the close
12
of the war, that young Aylwin was born. The
first years of his boyhood displayed a generous
spirit, a contempt of danger, and those ardent
feelings, which, though not uncommon at that age,
add much to worth, and generally characterized
the subsequent stages of life. He received there
the rudiments of his education, which, however,
was not further extended than to the first
principles
of mathematics, an elementary knowledge
of the Latin, and a perfect acquaintance with the
French language. His father destined him to a
naval life, and while yet a child, had him borne
on the books of a frigate which captain Coffin,
(afterwards Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin Greenly)
then commanded. The intentions of his father
were, however, not long after, frustrated by an
occurence that young Aylwin witnessed in the
streets of Quebec. The horror excited in his
breast at seeing a lad whom he had known, torn
from the bosom of his parents by a pressgang,
caused an invincible disgust to the British naval
service; he could never again be brought to think
of entering it. His attachment, notwithstanding,
to a sea life was not lessened; and he became
urgent with his parents to send him to their
relatives
in New England, that he might enter the
American service. While arrangements were
making to carry his wishes into effect, he was
suddenly left an orphan by the death of his
parents
,
within the short space of two months of
each other.
This loss was in some degree alleviated by the
kind attentions of a paternal uncle, who finding it
impracticable to procure a suitable situation for
his nephew in his favorite profession, endeavored
to dissuade him from a life of danger, and turn his
attention to mercantile pursuits. An effort was
made to comply with the intreaties of his uncle,
but it was ineffectual. He was then bound
apprentice
to a captain in the London trade upon
most favorable terms; it being agreed that on
their arrival in England, he should be permitted
to remain at a naval academy for at least six
months, and that he should be advanced to the
grade of mate as soon as he acquired the
requisite
experience. As the captain had determined
not to return to Quebec, he little regarded the
stipulations into which he had so readily entered,
and, on his arrival at London, put his vessel into
the West-India trade.
Two voyages were made by our youth, and
such was the progress he made in his profession,
that hardly had he passed his fifteenth year when
he was made a mate in the ship. This pleasing
dawn, (which in some degree compensated for
the violation of the agreement) was soon
overcast
,
for on the homeward voyage a dispute arose
between him and his captain, which so enraged
the latter, that on coming to anchor, he caused
him to be kidnapped by a pressgang. He was
immediately sent on board a receiving ship in the
Thames, where he found himself surrounded by
six or seven hundred individuals, the scourings of
a vicious metropolis. All communication with
friends was denied him; letters which he wrote
were suppressed; hope itself was almost
excluded
from his breast. From this receptacle of
wretchedness he was in a few weeks transferred
to a gun brig. Here he was narrowly watched,
and endured all the rigor exercised in the
English
service towards their impressed men, to
induce
them to enter as
voluntary
seamen. The
great antipathy, however, which he had
conceived
for their service, would not permit him to
subscribe
to that which he considered would be his
own infamy. Threats were unavailing; he had
a mind that could not be subdued.
After cruising in the north sea, the brig was
ordered up the Miditerranean, and at the time of
the invasion of Egypt by the French, was
stationed
on that coast. From thence the vessel was
ordered to the East Indies; two years he passed
on board of her in the Red Sea; and three more
in different parts of the Indian Ocean. His
constitution
having become almost a sacrifice to the
climate, he was there invalided, and permitted to
return to his relatives and friends, by whom even
his existence was unknown.
In the course of the above service he was in
several engagements, and distinguished himself
particularly in one, by lashing to their brig the
bowsprit of a French corvette, and then
boarding
.
A warrant was offered him on the occasion,
and promises were constantly held out to him of
promotion, if he would but enter. These he
always
withstood, and though few indeed could he
find among his messmates to commune with, yet
he preferred his station of captain of the foretop
to any office that could be bestowed on him in that
service. While in the Mediterranean and the
Red Sea, almost his sole resource for amusement
and instruction, was his bible. In identifying the
positions of places distinguished in the sacred
volume, and in tracing in the manners of the
modern those of the ancient inhabitants of the
surrounding countries, he would often forget the
loss of his liberty and the evils of his situation.
Although the inmate of the forecastle for more
than six years, yet he remained untainted by the
surrounding contagion.
A short residence with his friends in Boston
reestablished
his health, and having become by
adoption, what he almost considered himself by
birth, a citizen of the United States, he
immediately
obtained from his uncle that employment in
the merchant service which a thorough knowledge
of seamanship entitled him to anticipate. Such
was the noble youth for whom Harriet Palmer in
secret sighed.
The anniversary of Ellen's birth and her
parent's
marriage, both occurred on the sixth day of
November, and had always been religiously
observed
by the family as a day of festivity and joy.
The approaching celebration of these two events
was to be more than usually brilliant, for Ellen
was determined to treat her friends in the
evening
,
to a
masked ball!
A fete of this kind was
almost unknown on this side the Atlantic, and was
a direct violation of one of the municipal
regulations
of the good citizens of Boston. But Ellen
was so earnest in her request, and her parents so
unwilling to refuse her any indulgence that would
contribute to her happiness on this occasion, that
they finally consented, on condition that the
company
should he select, few, and such as so
romantic
a design could be safely confided to; that no
one should enter the ball-room without first
unmasking
to some one of the family who knew
them; and that every one in coming and
departing
should wear over their dress a dark domino
of a fashion not calculated to attract the attention
and curiosity of that inquisitive class of citizens
who too often neglect their own concerns to pry
into those of their neighbours. To all this Ellen
readily agreed, and the proper instructions were
added to every card.
12*
Among the numerous visitants who frequented
this hospitable mansion, was general Dearborn, a
veteran of the revolution, and a friend of major
Willoughby. He was now collector of customs
for the port of Boston, having recently resigned
the arduous duties of secretary of war. This
gallant officer discovered in George Willoughby
all that noble enthusiasm and genuine honor,
which had so eminently distinguished his father
and secured him the friendship of Washington.
He took every occasion of inflaming his youthful
ardor by recounting the events attending his own
campaigns, and particularly the desperate but
unsuccessful attack on Quebec, in which he was
engaged with Montgomery, Arnold, and Morgan,
and their little band of veterans. Dearborn was
attached to the corps under Arnold, who was
wounded early in the action and carried from the
field. Morgan succeeded to the command, and
with a voice louder than the tempest animated
the troops as they stormed the first barrier, and
entered the town. Montgomery had already bled
on immortal ground, and his division being
repulsed
,
the corps under Morgan was exposed to
a sanguinary but unavailing contest. From the
windows of the store-houses, each a castle, and
from the tops of the parapets, a destructive fire
was poured upon the assailants. In vain was the
second barrier gained by scaling ladders; double
ranks of soldiers presented a forest of bayonets
below, and threatened inevitable destruction to
any one who should leap from the walls.
Dearborn
maintained for a long time this desperate
warfare, until at last he and the remnant of his
company, overpowered by a sortie of two
hundred
men with field pieces who attacked him in
front and rear in a short street, were compelled
to surrender. He was now put into rigid
confinement
,
with a number of other officers, who
were not allowed to converse with each other,
unless in the presence of the officer of the guard.
While in prison he was urgently solicited by the
English officers to join the British: was promised
a colonel's commission if he would accept it, and
was assured, if he refused, that he would be sent
out to England in the spring and inevitably
hanged
as a rebel. The only reply he made to their
solicitations or menaces was, that he had taken
up arms in defence of the liberties and rights of
his country; that he never would disgrace
himself
nor dishonor his profession by receiving any
appointment under Great Britain, but was ready
to meet death in any shape rather than relinquish
the glorious cause he had espoused. He was
paroled in the following May.
In the hard-fought battle which decided the
fate of Burgoyne's army, Dearborn was ordered
to pass the enemy's right wing, and take
possession
of eight heavy cannon which played over
the British into the American lines. In executing
this order, he was charged by a corps of light
infantry, which he repulsed with fixed bayonets,
gained the eminence, took the cannon and corps
of artillery attached to them, and having disposed
of them, made a rapid movement into the rear of
the British lines, and gave a full fire before his
approach was discovered. The British were
soon after forced into a precipitate retreat, and
Dearborn assisted in storming their works through
the whole extent, under a tremendous fire of grape
and musketry.

To a recital of these events, George would
listen with an attention as greedy as that of
Desdemona
while her gallant lover recounted his
perilous deeds and hair-breadth escapes. George
could never hear of wars, but
much he wish'd
To follow to the field some warlike chief.
In dreaming of future glory, playing on his
harp, writing poetry, and playing with the

his hours flitted rapidly away, until the

to Cambridge.
CHAPTER XV.
AN AMERICAN MASQUERADE.
Here beaux esprits in various figures lurk,
Of Jew and Gentile, Bramin, Tartar, Turk;
Wonder, all shapes in this assembly finds,
Hermits and demons, emperors and hinds;
All that diversify life's crowded field,
And all prolific fantasy can yield.
Hayley
.
Ellen's
birth-day, like every other day,
arrived
in due order of time, and completed her
seventeenth year. Her father, as usual, gave a
sumptuous dinner, to which a large circle of his
friends were invited. A band of music performed
during the repast, which was succeeded by songs,
toasts, and sentiments. This part of the
festival
was in honor of eighteen years uninterrupted
connubial felicity which the parents of Ellen had
enjoyed, and was attended solely by married
guests. The evening was devoted to the
celebration
of Ellen's birth.
A suit of three spacious apartments, in the
second
story of the house, was prepared, and
decorated
under the immediate and sole direction of
Ellen and Amelia; here their united efforts of
taste and fancy had been exerted for more than
a week, assisted by every novel that they could
procure, which contained an account of a similar
fete. The three rooms, thus appropriated, were
metamophosed into as many gardens, abounding
with evergreens and artificial flowers, which were
so artfully interwoven and arranged, as entirely
to conceal the walls and ceiling. Each door and
window represented the entrance of a beautiful
arbor, in the flowery arch of which was
suspended
a gilded cage, containing different species
of American singing birds, surrounded with
variegated
lamps, sparkling with a thousand
brilliant
tints.
In the centre of the middle apartment was
erected an elegant temple, consisting of a dome
supported by eighteen Corinthian pillars,
dedicated
to Liberty, with a full-size statue of the
goddess, standing on a pedestal, supporting the
constitution with one hand, and the liberty-cap
on a spear with the other. Around the gilded
dome of this beautiful edifice was the music
gallery
.
A vine of laurel, mingled with roses, crept
up each column, and the American eagle was
suspended
from the centre of the dome over the
head of the statue. On the inside of each pillar
hung a shield, bearing the arms of the state it
represented; and between them descended a
green curtain, from the gallery to the floor,
which, when dropped, concealed every thing
within the temple.
The adjacent apartments, on the right and left,
contained each a spacious recess, which was now
transformed into a beautiful pavilion, ornamented
with lattice-work and flowers, and illuminated
with variegated lamps. In the centre was a table,
liberally furnished with fruits and other
refreshments
for the ladies, and surrounded with sofas
for their accommodation.
Two of the corresponding apartments in the
third story were thrown into one, (by means of a
sliding partition) for the supper-room, where the
tables were fancifully decorated, and loaded with
every dainty of the season, while the sideboards
furnished ample supplies of American wine, from
the vineyards of New-Switzerland, and every
domestic
beverage that could tempt the palate.
Every appendage and ornament to this gala
was American, though the fete itself was truly an
exotic. Even the dresses of the guests were to
be wholly composed of domestic fabrics, and
fifty dominos, of the same materials, were
prepared
for those who should decline supporting
characters.
O, you extravagant hussey! exclaimed her
father, as he took a survey of the apartments and
their decorations, a dozen such birth-days would
make me a bankrupt.
It is your wedding day, papa, replied Ellen
archly, at the same time kissing his hand; and
I feel it a duty as well as a pleasure to honor that
event to the best of my abilities.
She was an only child, and her father smiled
at her observation.
At eight o'clock the company began to
assemble
,
and were received in the front parlor, by Mr.
and Mrs. Cushing, dressed in the plain costume
of the New-England pilgrims, as they first landed
at Plymouth. Here the guests assumed their
masks, and those who were dressed for characters
laid aside their dominos. They were then
conducted
up stairs, and ushered into an
anti-chamber
,
adjoining the centre garden, where they
were received by Ellen, habited as a shepherdess,
with her crook fancifully ornamented with
garlands
,
but without her mask. From this
apartment
a flight of stairs ascended to the
supper-room
,
and directly opposite was the entrance to
the ball-room.
This entrance, from the anti-chamber,
represented
a general's marque, with the American
standard on each side, united at the top, and here
George Willoughby, dressed as a general officer,
received the company from his cousin, and
conducting
them into his tent, permitted them to
emerge into the full splendor of the illuminated
gardens.
Ellen and George could scarcely refrain from
smiling at the ludicrous effect of their own
arrangement
,
as the motley group passed under
their review and inspection. There were
gipseys
,
fortune-tellers, virgins of the sun, Venuses,
Dianas, flower-girls, queens, and ballad-singers,
among the ladies; and priests, sailors, knights,
clowns, conjurers, pilgrims, soldiers, heathen
gods, and christian devils, among the gentlemen;
besides many dominos who supported no
artificial
character, and some of them perhaps possessed
no
real
one.
Many of the guests, particularly those of the
dinner party, were in their usual
dresses
, and
without masks, among whom was general
Dearborn
,
and several members of the state
legislature
,
who were assembled in a group near the
temple of Liberty, to survey the happy
performers
in the mazy dance.
While they were thus engaged, the curtains
between the pillars were suddenly drawn up by an
invisible hand, and hung in festoons beneath the
gallery. A mask, in the Roman
costume
of Julius
Csar, with the word
Ambition
, in letters of
blood, on his forehead, then approached the
temple
,
and after surveying for a moment the
beautiful
figure within, drew his sword, and made a
desperate plunge at her breast; when, to the
wonder and astonishment of all, the shield, (
emblematical
of the constitution) which her left hand
supported, was instantly raised and parried the
weapon. Three similar attempts were made with
as little success, and Ambition reluctantly
departed
.
While the spectators were expressing
their admiration at the ingenuity of the machinery
which must have effected this movement, and
completed the happy allegory, another mask
approached
,
in the character of Lovegold, old,
decrepit
,
and meanly attired; on his wrinkled
forehead
was the word
Avarice
, written with
charcoal. After tottering once or twice round the
temple, stopping at each pillar to take a peep at
the goddess, through a pair of leather spectacles,
he paused exactly behind her, and raising a
rough crab-tree cudgel, aimed a blow that must
have felled the statue to the ground, had not his
arm been arrested by
Patriotism
, in the
costume
of Cincinnatus.
Several different assailants, by turns, were
thus foiled in their attacks upon Liberty, some
by the constitution, some by Patriotism, and
others by both, in conjunction with Mars, who
appeared in complete armor, and was well
represented
in the manly figure of Aylwin. This
scene soon became so interesting, that it com
manded the attention of all the company, and
the dances were suspended.
Eighteen little girls, dressed in white, trimmed
with laurel, each holding a garland of roses in
her hand, now entered the temple, surrounded
the statue, united their wreaths, and performed
a dance in honor of Liberty; the music playing
a national air.
Just as the dance terminated, a figure
approached
the temple, in the character of
Ochrobond
,
in the Forty Thieves, armed with a short
javelin in his right hand, and holding in his left
a speckled snake, winding round his arm; his
mask representing a countenance truly diabolical,
so that many of the ladies screamed with affright;
on his forehead was inscribed, in flame-colored
characters,
Faction
. As he approached the
temple, the eighteen sisters appeared terrified,
but still remained united, and grasped more
firmly the flowery links which connected them.
Several times did the demon attempt to cut one
of these wreaths, that he might enter the circle
and approach nearer his intended victim; but
was as often foiled in the attempt by the caution
of the little girls. He then seized one of them
by the arm, and attempted to tear her from the
ring by force, but at that moment
Patriotism
repeated aloud
Frown indignantly on the first
dawning of an attempt to alienate any portion of
this country from the rest, or enfeeble the sacred
ties which now link its various parts
.
[11]
[11]
Washington's Farewell Address.
The
demon
started, relinquished his hold, and
disappeared
.
In a few minutes, however, he returned, and
with him all the discomfited enemies of Liberty,
armed with bows and arrows, headed by
Ambition
,
13
who was supported on one hand by
Britannia
,
and on the other by the genius of France.
This motley group surrounded the temple and
notched their arrows, but as the word was given
to discharge, each of the sisters snatched her
shield from the pillar, and opposed it to the
assault
,
forming a complete circle of shields, each
one bearing the arms of the state it protected.
The arrows fell harmless at their feet, and before
another discharge could be made, the assailants
were put to flight by
Patriotism
and
Mars
, who
attacked them sword in hand. The states
replaced
their shields, and renewed the dance for
a few minutes, when the music ceased, and the
goddess of Liberty thus addressed the admiring
spectators:
Vain the attempt, though men with fiends combine,
To raze this Temple, or pollute the shrine;
In vain each foe the threatening weapon wields,
While Union guards me with a wall of shields;
Till these firm pillars totter from their base,
Columbia still is Freedom's dwelling-place.
But, O, my sons! should yonder threatening cloud,
Spread o'er this dome its dark portentous shroud;
Should War's red tempest burst on Freedom's shore,
And hostile cannon round our borders roar
Behold your leader! whose intrepid form [
Dearborn
.
Shall be a bulwark to avert the storm;
His glittering blade, which flash'd with Freedom's fire
Where proud Quebec's embattled walls aspire,
At Saratoga mock'd the lightning's flame,
And carv'd his path to glory and to fame.
Columbians yet, by such a chieftain led,
Shall plant my standard where Montgomery bled.
Having said this, she descended with graceful
dignity from the pedestal, and advanced into the
hall, with the eighteen sisters following in her
train. Who is she? Who can she be? was
now echoed from every mouth, and a crowd of
worshippers soon surrounded the goddess, who,
taking
Patriotism
by the arm, eluded the
curious
throng, and disappeared at a private door
entirely concealed by foliage. It was Amelia
and George who had thus disappeared.
The dances were now resumed, when a
beautiful
la fille sauvage
was seen peeping cautiously
through one of the arbors, as if in search of some
one that had eluded her pursuit. Her
costume
was strikingly characteristic, and the eyes of
our idle party were soon rivetted upon her. She
timidly advanced, still throwing her eyes around
the garden, and starting, as if alarmed by some
passing footstep.
Who are you, my pretty Indian princess?
enquired the general as she approached the
party.
Pocahontas is my name.
And whom do you seek?
After some modest hesitation, she replied
Captain Smith.
That's my name, exclaimed a mask, just
then approaching, in an elegant military uniform;
how can I be so happy as to serve you?
She looked up playfully in his face, and then
shook her head. Ah! you are not
my
Smith;
he flies from Pocahontas, although she loves him,
and once saved his life. But I will seek for him
through all the forest. O, how this poor bosom
throbs! it will be a cold pillow for him if he does
not return to it soon.
Hang him for an insensible dog! he'll never
return, replied the soldier; but here is a Smith
that is ready to throw himself at your feetand
he actually kneeled to the red princess.
No, no, no! cried she; you no Smith,
you no soldier; you desert Miss Liberty. Now
kneel again, and pray Pocahontas never tell.
Morse (for it was himself) was evidently
embarrassed
by this reply from the fascinating
savage; not that her insinuation was correct, but
because he found himself recognized by one
whom he did not know.
Liberty or death
, has hitherto been my
motto
,
cried he; but I shall now take the
liberty
of
changing it to
Liberty or Pocahontas
.
At this moment a young sailor, who had
particularly
regarded the fair savage from her first
entrance, approached her with a respectful bow,
and thus addressed her:
Pardon me, beautiful princess, for being the
messenger of ill news, but duty compels me to
speakyour Smith is no more! Go with me
and I will show you his grave.
Pocahontas, who had started at his approach,
was visibly agitated by this address. At length
she exclaimed
Dead! did you say? O, cruel white man,
do not tell me so. Pocahontas will break her
heart. Who slew him?
No one, sweet Pocahontas; disease assailed
him, and he bowed to the irresistible malady.
But let us go and weep together over the grave
of our common friend:
The full-orb'd moon will shed her silver rays
To light our footsteps through the forest's maze.
In character as a poet, Aylwin, exclaimed
Morse; but a sailor ought to be better
acquainted
with lunar movements. The pale-faced
goddess is not
full-orb'd
, but is now in her wane,
and, conscious of her fading beauty, did not, this
evening, presume to show her face until half past
ten o'clock.
I am neither an astronomer nor a conjurer,
replied the sailor; and shall leave the
calculation
of Cynthia's precise shape, size, and altitude,
to those whose brains are under her more
immediate
influence. For
While this fair planet beams celestial light,
Sun, moon, and stars are all eclipsed in night.
So saying, he bowed to Pocahontas, and taking
her willing hand, led her away, while several
voices exclaimedHappy Aylwin!
After eluding the eyes of curiosity, by
winding
among the shrubbery, he led her to a remote
window-seat in the adjacent room, which, being
surrounded by an arbor, entirely concealed them
from observation.
The gallant sailor was probably prompted by
a spirit of adventure, and a curiosity to discover
more of this interesting character. The motives
of the fair one I shall not attempt to define.
For more than a minute they gazed at each
other without speaking; till the son of Neptune,
beginning to feel embarrassed, took her
affectionately
by the hand, and enquired
Did Pocahontas love Smith?
You have read her history, was the answer
of the princess.
Sailor
. But when she thought him dead, she
transferred her love to Rolfe. Let me be Rolfe,
and be persuaded, lovely creature! that your
Smith
is
dead.
Pocahontas
. And would you accept a
transfer
of the
heart?
That is a species of merchandise
13*
of which every one wishes to be the original
holder.
Sailor
. I will accept
your
heart on any terms.
Name the conditions, and I swear to comply with
them.
Pocahontas
. Quite in character as a
sailor
,
but not as a
merchant;
do you often purchase
unsight, unseen?
Sailor
. In this case I am willing to run the
risk. With such a shape, air, voice, and hand,
Heaven would never unite a bad heart, nor an
indifferent
face. Love has always been blind, and
the risk is fair, because it is mutual.
Pocahontas
. No, Mr. Orville, I believe the
advantage is on my side.
Orville
. Since you know me, fair princess
off, base vizard! But who, in the name of all
that is fascinating, are you? Permit me to remove
that envious mask which obstructs the rays of
beauty.
Pocahontas
. Forbear, rash man! Can your
eyes gaze at a meridian sun?
Orville
. I fear not, for they are already
dazzled
by those two twinkling stars. But every
moment increases my admiration and impatience;
every word you speak rivets a magic chain to
my heart. O then, banish that sable cloud, and
let the rosy morning burst upon my enraptured
view.
Pocahontas
. Clouds depend upon the wind.
Orville
. Then my sighs shall increase to a
gale; can it not be dissipated by the breath of
love?
Pocahontas
. I had thought that no disguise
could screen Harriet Palmer from the penetration
of Mr. Orville.
Orville
. (
In a tone of disappointment
.) Is it
possible! But your feigned voice completely
deceived me. Well, Harriet, (
replacing his mask
)
since it is
you
, this scene terminates, and
exit Jack
.
Pocahontas
. And why so, Mr. Orville, am I
not worth a few pretty speeches?
Orville
. O yes; but it is trespassing on
forbidden
ground; besides,
you know
there would
be no meaning in pretty speeches coming
from
me
.
Pocahontas
. So, when you meet with an
unsuspecting
girl, who is not blest with that
knowledge
,
you merely practise them for your own
amusement. You should recollect, that though
it be sport to you, it may be death to us.
Orville
. Nay, since you are serious, Harriet,
I will explain. My heart is like an undutiful
rebellious
child. I
must
part with it to somebody,
(and that very soon) to prevent its running away.
Pocahontas
. And why not let it run?
Orville
. Because I fear it would intrude itself
among its betters, and get kicked out of doors in
disgrace. I hoped to have found an asylum for
it in the bosom of Pocahontas: Harriet Palmer,
I know, has not one to give in exchange.
Pocahontas
. In plain English, Mr. Orville,
you are in love with some one who does not return
your affection. Is it not so?
Orville
. I
should be
over head and ears in
such a scrape, if I dared. I will confess,
Harriet
,
that there is a little spark here which I labor
hard to keep smothered; but the gentlest breath
of hope would blow it to a flame, that would
either light me to happiness, or consume me to
ashes.
Pocahontas
. (
With a deep sigh
.) Then there
is no hope for(
she paused
) for Pocahontas!
Orville
. What mean you, Harriet?
Pocahontas
. And who is this cruel fair one?
Do I know her?
Orville
. You dobut she does not merit that
epithetshe is the most gentle and generous of
her sex. Fortune alone is cruel for placing her
beyond my reach. She is rich, and I am poor.
Pocahontas
. Confide in me, Mr. Orville, and
tell me her name.
Orville
. No, Harriet, not for the world!
Should it ever reach her ear that I entertained a
thought so presumptuous, I fear she would
despise
me, and I should be forever debarred the
felicity of her society and friendship, which I
now enjoy. The child of her father's bounty
But I am rambling.
Pocahontas
. (
In extreme agitation
.) Is it
El Ellen Cushing?
Orville
. Never let it escape your lips,
Harriet
,
or I am ruined. It
is
Ellen Cushing.Now
say if there is room for hope?
Pocahontas
. Yesfor hope and happiness.
Orville
. How!
Pocahontas
. (
Reclining her head on Orville's
shoulder
.) Ellen loves you.
Orville
. Do not sport with my feelings,
Harriet
;
how can you be so cruel!
Pocahontas
. I do not sportEllen loves you;
I have heard her repeat it a thousand times.
Orville
. Though you tell me what it would
be madness to believe, Harriet, still repeat it;
for, by Heaven, though I know it cannot be true,
it is bliss to hear the sentence.
Pocahontas
. Ellen loves you.
This was whispered so close, that the lips of
Pocahontas touched Orville's cheek; her bosom
heaved, and her whole frame was agitated.
Orville
,
by an indescribable kind of instinct, caught
her in his armsher mask fell offit was Ellen
herself.
At this critical moment they were alarmed by
a universal shriek from the ladies, followed by a
confused tumult, which compelled them to quit
their retreat to learn the cause of the disturbance.
As the reader may possibly possess a similar
curiosity
,
I will endeavor to satisfy him in the next
chapter.
CHAPTER XVI.
A NEW CHARACTER.
He has, I know not what,
Of greatness in his looks, and of high fate,
That almost awes me.
Dryd.Mar.A-la-mode
.
My soul is wrapt in dreadful expectation,
And listens to thee as if Fate were speaking.
Den. Ap. Virg.
As Orville and Pocahontas left the group at
the temple, the attention of the company was
attracted
by a new character. This was a
travelling
minstrel, with his harp slung on his back
Adorn'd with native elegance, he wore
In simplest form, the minstrel dress of yore.
He was instantly surrounded by the idlers of
both sexes, offering him money to play; and
after receiving several cents in his hat, he sat
down on the steps of the temple to tune his harp.
The band in the gallery had ceased, and the
dancers began to assemble around the new comer.
While he was tuning the instrument, few persons
believed that he would attempt to play; but when
he passed his fingers over the trembling chords,
every eye glistened with surprise and pleasure.
The tones were so sweet, and the melody so
exquisite
,
that the auditors at length seemed almost
entranced with wonder and delight. After
running
through a short, but very expressive
symphony
,
he sung the following in a voice only
surpassed in sweetness by the tones which
accompanied
it:
THE MINSTREL.
How happy is the Minstrel's lot,
Whose song each care beguiles;
The frowns of fortune fright him not,
Nor does he court her smiles.
Contented with his tuneful lyre,
His art can yield the rest,
He pours his soul along the wire,
And rapture fires his breast.
He envies not the power of kings,
With all their glittering toys;
The tones that warble from his strings,
Impart sublimer joys.
He builds a world of airy bliss,
Where Love erects his throne;
And though his fancy frame the kiss,
Its sweets are all his own.
What though no wealth his song repays,
Nor laurels deck his lyre;
The glow he catches from its lays,
Is bliss supremely higher.
What though his fairy pleasures seem
Illusions shapeless toys
He would not lose so sweet a dream,
For all your waking joys.
As the last note of the concluding symphony
expired, a mask, in the dress of a black friar,
addressed the performer in a low voice, but in a
tone so wonderfully singular, that George started
with surprise. His stature was large, and his
deportment dignified, but so completely was he
enveloped in his sable cowl, that no feature,
except
a piercing black eye, could be discerned.
Friar
. Does it become the only son of
Edward
Willoughby, the destined champion of
American Freedom, to waste his precious hours
in idleness?in worse than idlenessrevelling
in the lap of luxurious pleasure, and reposing
on beds of roseswhile his intrepid countrymen
are braving the dangers of war, and snatching
but a moment's rest on the cold ground, before
the yell of battle arouses them to the work of
death? How would that delicate hand,
habituated
to trill the wires of a harphow would it
handle the deadly rifle, or wield the sword of
Washington?
George
. (
Visibly embarrassed
.) Howwho
are you?
Friar
. The friend of your fatherthe
destined
Mentor of his son.
George
. Where knew you my father?
Friar
. On the battle-field where he lost his
hand. There he dedicated you to his country,
and called on high Heaven to sanction the oath.
A thousand times since has he ratified the
contract
,
and I now claim its fulfilment.
George
. The son of Edward Willoughby will
require no prompter when his country is in
danger
.
But who commissioned you to prefer her
claim? (
He struck a few careless notes on his harp,
and then asked with a smile
) Who signed your
credentials?
Friar
. Who announced your birth?I am
At this moment the falling of a chandelier, in
the adjacent room, called a universal shriek from
all the ladies; which, mingled with the crash of
broken glass, and the confusion of voices, created
a momentary tumult, in which all were engaged,
except George and the mysterious stranger, both
of whom seemed too much interested in the
conversation
to relinquish it for so trifling an
occurrence
.
George had now risen, and exclaimed
in a tone of surprise
Announced my birth!Indeed you create
a strange interest in my bosom. Speakbe
more explicit. Who are you?
The stranger answered not, but throwing open
his mantle, discovered a Miami warrior in the
full dress of his tribean exact counterpart of
the picture in major Willoughby's possession.
George was lost for a moment in astonishment.
George
. Whoever you are, the
costume
of the
character you have assumed is inimitably
correct
;
and how you could thus have copied it
without ever seeing the picture, I must confess
I am at a loss to determine.
Friar
. I have nothing to do with
pictures
or
copies
. I am an
original
. You are my pupil,
and the day fast approaches when the lessons I
shall teach you must be put into practice in your
country's defence. Even now the tomahawk is
suspended; the ambush is laid; and before the
rays of to-morrow's sun shall sparkle on the
bosom
of Erie, numerous white men will fall before
the treachery of the foe. Your country calls!
Obey her voice! for in the womb you were
devoted
to her service!
So saying, he wrapped himself in his mantle,
drew the cowl over his face, and, before George
could reply, was lost among the crowd that
surrounded the scene of confusion in the next
room.
A most tender scene between Orville and Ellen
had been interrupted by the same disaster, and
they were joined by our minstrel just as the
signal
was given for supper, when every mask was
laid aside, and the whole party ascended to the
banquet-hall.
During the repast, Orville and Ellen were
seated opposite each other, and their eyes spoke
unutterable things; they literally banquetted
on lovers' food, and scarcely honored with a
moment's notice the delicious
realities
before
them. Near Orville sat another who appeared
also to have forgotten the purpose for which he
came. This was George. The words of the
Mysterious Chief
still rung in his ears, and he
examined every countenance at table, without
discovering any feature that could have belonged
to that singular character. No one knew what
had become of the friar: neither his entrance
nor his exit had been observed. Such a crowd
of images obtruded on the mind of our hero, that
he was entirely insensible to the scene of festive
gaiety around him, and left the table having
scarcely tasted a morsel.
Your country calls
youobey her voice, for in the womb you were
devoted
to her service
. What could this mean?
America was at peace with all the world. He
was lost in conjecture, and wandered alone
through the lately crowded rooms in profound
meditation.
14
Shall I tell your fortune? said a little gipsey
to George, as he stood leaning against a pillar
of the temple. He gave her his hand.
Gipsey
. What a beautiful hand! and how
wonderfully marked with the chequers of fortune!
George
. And what do you discover there, my
little prophetess?
Gipsey
. That you are beloved by a female
whom you never suspected of affection, and who
would cheerfully make a pilgrimage to Mecca, if
by so doing she could acquire a right to this hand.
George
. Her name
Gipsey
. I dare not tell.
George
. How then can I profit by your
information
?
Gipsey
. Will it give you no pleasure to
know
that you are beloved?
George
. Not unless I can love in return.
Gipsey
. And could you refuse your heart to an
affectionate girl who doats on you?
George
. Suppose that I have no heart to
refuse
?
Gipsey
. Catharine will forget youperhaps
you will never see her again.
George
. Do you read that in my hand?
Gipsey
. We are interruptedmeet me at the
east pavilion, there I will tell you more; and
away she tripped, leaving George not a little
surprized
at her language and manner. At that
moment
his sister, with their cousin Aylwin,
approached
,
and the latter exclaimed
Beware of idolatry, George; here comes the
deity of the temple.
George
. Who is that gipsey, Amelia?
Aylwin
. Admirable! excellent! upon my
honor. After abandoning the supper table,
supper
and all, with the glittering attractions around
it, to enjoy a private
tete a tete
with a strolling
gipsey
,
he gravely enquires, who is she? Don't
you think that your brother is rapidly improving
in refinement and gallantry?
George
. Do you know her, Amelia?
Amelia
. I am not at liberty to unmask any
one of this company without their consent.
The company now began to descend in crowds
from the supper-room, and resume their masks,
when a scene of gay confusion commenced.
The exhilirating draughts of
American
wine had
imparted a
patriotic
glow to almost every bosom,
and good-humored wit and mirth now circulated
without restraint. Characters and dominos who
had scarcely ventured to breathe a syllable before
supper, now found no difficulty in rattling out
whole sentences, without regard to reason, rhyme,
or syntax. Dull formality was entirely
discarded
,
and that happy freedom tolerated which
approaches
to the very verge of decorum without
overstepping the line.
As soon as George could escape from his
sister
and cousin Aylwin, he resumed his mask, and
strolled towards the east pavilion in search of
his kind little gipsey; but as he entered the
apartment
a gold repeater in his pocket struck a
quarter
past four, and at that moment the
Mysterious
Chief
stood again before him. Our hero started
as if he had seen a spectre, while the object of
his surprise exclaimed
Relinquish the pursuit! and obey the voice
of your country.
What of my country? inquired George,
when does she require my service?
Now!Hark! the war-whoop sounds!the
shriek of death echoes through the forest! and
the vulture whets her beak for a bloody repast!
The camp of the white man is surprised!he
bleeds!he falls!he rises!and if he
conquers
Maniac! What a singular taste for a
masquerade
character!
Obey your country's call!in the womb
you was devoted to her service. I have reminded
your father of his engagement. Remember me!
With this exclamation he again disappeared
among the crowd.
CHAPTER XVII.
AN AVOWAL.
Love gives esteem, and then he gives desert,
He either finds equality, or makes it;
Like Death, he knows no difference in degrees,
But planes and levels all.
Dryd. Mar. A-la-mode
.
On
the evening succeeding the foregoing fete,
the light-hearted Ellen (whose artificial vivacity
had given place to the genuine ebullitions of real
felicity) sought a private interview with her
affectionate
mother, into whose maternal ear she
poured her little tale of love. With her blushing
face concealed in the bosom of a doating parent,
she hesitated not in confiding to the same
sanctuary
the tenderest secrets of her heart. Not a
thought nor a wish was disguised; she described
the real state of her affections, and related the
particulars
of that interesting eclaircissement which
took place at the masquerade.
The result of this candid disclosure was, in the
course of the following week, thus announced
to the public, through the medium of Russell's
Columbian Centinel:
Notice is hereby given, that William Orville
has become a joint partner in the mercantile house of
Nathan Cushing, and that the business of said
house will, in future, be conducted under the firm of
Gushing
and
Orville
.
The tenth day of December was fixed for the
celebration of the nuptials of Amelia, and all
parties
consented, that on the same day the fortunate
Orville should lead his Ellen to the altar. Of a
happier family perhaps that metropolis could not
boast, until a slight tincture of gloom was thrown
over it by a letter from Mulberry Grove,
containing
the unpleasant intelligence that Amelia's
paternal
aunt was severely indisposed, although her
disorder was believed to be unattended with
danger
.
This letter was addressed by the major to
his son, who has generously permitted me to make
from the original copy the following
EXTRACT:
Every thing in the political world indicates
an approaching war, and I am daily more and
more impressed with a conviction of its speedy
commencement. All nature seems to unite also
in predicting some uncommon event, and I will
venture to assert that the present year remains
unparalleled in modern history for physical
phenomena
.
Comets, importing change to times and states,
Brandish their crystal tresses in the sky.
One of those rare and erratic bodies, alike unusual
for its magnitude and brilliancy, is still sweeping
14*
through the southern hemisphere, which it
illuminates
with its illimitable torch, and for aught
I know,
From its fiery hair,
Shakes pestilence and war.
An almost total eclipse of the sun has involved
our country in darkness at noon-day.
[12]
[12]
On the seventeenth day of September, 1811, the sun suffered an
annular, amounting almost to a total eclipse.
For the
intensity of the summer's heat, the oldest
remembrance
scarce can find a parallel. In one place
the earth has been parched with drought; in
another deluged with torrents of rain; and
unheard-of
inundations have, in many parts, swept
along with them, in promiscuous ruin, the works
of nature, the monuments of art, and the products
of the field. In many places pestilence, under a
form entirely new, has prevailed to an alarming
degree, prostrating whole families and settlements
at once. The proud city of Charleston has been
almost destroyed by a hurricane. Storms at sea
and disastrous shipwrecks, have impoverished
hundreds, and plunged thousands in mourning and
lamentation; while earthquakes on land have
caused our habitations to toter over our
seemingly
devoted heads.
I will not say that these things are certain
prognostics of any greater human calamity, but I
believe that they are the
effects
of that moral
depravity
from which alone all human calamities
originate.
I will insist that there is more analogy
between
the moral and physical worlds than
philosophers
are willing to admit. I do not contend that
comets produce wars and fightings, but I do
believe
that the evil passions and lusts from which
wars and fightings are said to proceed, may
sensibly
affect the motion of matter; and even,
perhaps
,
attract a comet from its regular orbit, to
gaze on the monster man.
Recollect, this is merely my opinion. I would
not wish you to imbibe any weak or superstitious
ideas; but to view every thing in the light of
reason, revelation, and philosophy. But never,
I conjure you, lose sight of the close, real, and
inseparable connexion which exists between
spirit and matter, which is the same thing as
between
cause
and
effect
. This will enable you to
account for many phenomena that would
otherwise
remain inexplicable. Of the reality of such
connexion I have abundant proof; and that
wonderful
sympathy which could prompt your
mother's
departing spirit to address her husband
through the motionless lips of a lifeless corpse,
has been displayed in numerous other instances,
equally extraordinary. But when, from the
prejudices
of education and other causes, a man
becomes determined to deny the existence of
any connexion between the spiritual and natural
worlds, the most stupendous miracle would
produce
no effect on his scepticism; he would not
be convinced though one rose from the dead. He
has adopted a different theory; and, right or
wrong, he is determined to adhere to it.
Whatever
occurrence interferes with this theory, is
deemed an illusion of the bodily senses.
I have little news to communicate.
Emigration
to this part of the country continues to
be immense. I this morning received a letter
from our neighbour Fleming, who is now on a
tour of business in the state of Pennsylvania,
accompanied
by his daughter. It was dated at
Robbstown, Westmoreland county, and contains
the following paragraph:
In the course of the last four weeks, two hun
dred and thirty-six waggons and other wheeled
carriages passed through this place to the state
of Ohio, with families. Sixty persons accom
panied one waggon. About six hundred Me
rino sheep have also passed in the same direc
tion during that short period.
If your aunt's indisposition assumes a
favorable
turn, (which the doctor says will be the
case) I shall be in Boston by the middle of
November
,
and there I hope to embrace a son-in-law.
Adieu.
Although the countenance of Aylwin wore an
incredulous smile, while his cousin George was
reading the foregoing letter, to his uncle's family,
he yet perfectly agreed with the writer in one
assertion
;
that every thing in the political world
indicated an approaching war; he had for some
time considered that event inevitable. For
several
years he had sailed as master of a vessel,
experiencing
many of those vexations and losses
from the respective belligerents to which
American
commerce had been exposed, and was
convinced
that the honor of the nation required a
speedy settlement. Since his last return from
Europe, he observed with pleasure that the
political
pulse beat in unison with his wishes on this
subject. He had no doubt that the approaching
session of congress would confirm his hopes, and
that war would be declared before it again
adjourned
.
To continue therefore in the
merchant
service would be sharing the dangers
without
the honours of warfare: to privateering he
would not willingly descend. The regular
service
appeared to him the only proper occupation
for one who disliked inglorious easethe field
where his courage and nautical skill would find
their reward.
With this impression Aylwin took an early
opportunity
of communicating his wishes to captain
Hull, of the frigate Constitution, who invited him
to take the station of sailing master on board of
his ship, with an assurance that his exertions
should not be wanting to procure him a
lieutenancy
as soon as practicable.
CHAPTER XVIII.
COINCIDENT AND CORROBORANT.
Something still there lies
In Heaven's dark volume which I read through mists!
'Tis great! prodigious! 'tis a dreadful birth
Of wond'rous Fate! and now, just now disclosing,
I see how terrible it dawns,
And my soul sickens at it.
Dryd. Oed.
The
middle of November arrived, without
bringing major Willoughby to Boston. Day
succeeded
day, and still he came not. The whole
month soon passed away without furnishing any
intelligence from Mulberry Grove. The lovers
grew uneasy, and all were fearful that the cause of
this delay was melancholy, if not fatal. But on
the first day of December their fears were reduced
to a certainty by the following letter addressed to
George. It was dated
Mulberry Grove, Ohio
,
Nov.
12, 1811.
My SonI have strange things to tell you
events that will excite your special wonder,
and which may almost cause you to doubt the
veracity of your father. Attend, therefore, while
I relate a series of facts as extraordinary as any
that ever figured in romance, either ancient or
modern.
In my last I mentioned the illness of your
auntI then considered it trifling; but yesterday
her mortal part was committed to its sister earth.
On Wednesday evening last, the sixth instant,
she appeared to be considerably better,
conversed
cheerfully, and desired me to seek for some
repose
,
as for the three preceding nights and days
I had scarcely closed an eye. A little after eleven
o'clock, she fell into a quiet sleep; when
commending
her to the care of the nurse, I composed
myself in the old easy chair, wrapped in my
great-coat, before a cheerful fire. It was some
time, however, before sleep visited my eyes; my
mind was occupied with far distant events, and
the picture of the Mysterious Chief hung
immediately
in my view over the fire-place. The
contemplation
of this object insensibly led me into a
train of reflections, with which you was
necessarily
connected, and in this frame of mind I fell
asleep.
My waking ideas pursued me in my dreams;
and wild forests, frightful precipices, treacherous
ambuscades, and tented fields, floated in wild
confusion
before my bewildered fancy. At length,
events appeared to occur in a more regular and
connected series; the battle of Miami rapids was
fought over again, with all its attendant
particulars
,
and the oracular corpse lay stretched before
me.
Suddenly, the scene was changed, and I found
myself wandering alone on the shores of Erie;
no habitation was visible, all seemed desolate,
and I felt lost and bewildered. In the midst of
my perplexity, I saw the figure of a man with a
drawn sword in his hand, emerging from the
wood with a slow and solemn step. It was the
same form that I had left lifeless on the
battle-field
,
but no wound nor blood was now visible.
With a dignified step, he advanced to the place
where I was standing, and with a smile of
benignity
tendered me his weapon; but in attempting
to take it, my hand trembled, and the sword fell to
the ground with a noise that awakened me.
I started from my chair, and found by the
clock that I had slept more than two hours. I
advanced
softly to the bed, and found both patient
and nurse in a sound sleep, and that of your aunt
appeared so sweet and gentle that I forebore to
awaken the nurse, and feeling considerably
refreshed
by my nap, determined to watch the
remainder
of the night myself.
I left the bed and walked to the window,
where I amused myself awhile in gazing on the
etherial expanse glowing with myriads of golden
stars; the waning moon was riding in cloudless
majesty over the eastern forests, and her silver
rays glittered on the bosom of the frozen lake.
As I turned again towards the fire, my steps
were impeded with something which, on
examination
,
I found to be the sword of Washington. It
had fallen, with its scabbard, from the hook by the
window, and lay nearly unsheathed upon the floor.
The noise produced by its falling must have been
that which awakened me so suddenly from my
dream; but
why
it should have fallen(and at
that particular moment too)was a mystery I
could not unravel. In my dream, the sword
presented
by the chief had fallen from my hand,
either through carelessness or terror. What did
that portend? The one I now replaced on the
hook, had long been idle in its scabbard. Was it
a reproof for remissness? That could not be, for
my country had all that time been at peace. Did
this weapon,
Self unscabbarded, foreshow
The footsteps of a secret foe?
*
*
Scott's Lady of the Lake.
While indulging such reflections, I again
threw myself into the chair; and, without
intending
it, was instantly asleep. My former dream
returned with all its particulars, and I was again
awakened in exactly the same manner, for
A clang
Of angry steel that instant rang.
*
With a kind of instinct I turned my eyes to the
spot where I expected to see again the prostrate
sword. I saw it not. The clock at that moment
struck three.
I feel, my son, a reluctance to proceed; for
you will immediately suspect that watching and
anxiety have turned your poor father's brain.
But, think of it as you will, I will leave nothing
untold. The same figure that appeared in my
dream, the exact counterpart of the picture on the
wall, in the same dress, and with the same aspect,
stood before me!
I was not in the least terrified, though the
circumstance
was such as would naturally produce
that sensation. To have unexpectedly discovered
an armed savage in my house at midnight,
hovering
round the couch of slumber, would, at any
other time, have much alarmed me; but now I
only felt surprised that a dream could thus be
continued after I believed myself to be awake.
I rubbed my eyes, and involuntarily exclaimed,
Is it possible!
still slowly advancing to the
mysterious apparition, who smiled as I
approached
,
with the same aspect of dignified benignity
that I admired in my dream.
My sword was in his hand! but not undrawn.
He gracefully presented me the hilt, with the same
courteous smile and majestic attitude that graced
the immortal hero who first tendered it to my
acceptance
.
Take it, said he in accents that thrilled to
my very soul; take it, and redeem your vow.
I had never forgotten the tones of that
mysterious
voice which announced your birth. I now
heard them again. After staring a moment in
astonishment, I exclaimed.Am I asleep or
awake? This is, indeed, a most singular dream!
The mysterious stranger heard me with
a smile, and then mildly replied: This is no
dream; the time has arrived for dormant
patriotism
to arouse, and for those who are destined to
defend their country to commence that sacred
duty.
My surprize, if possible, was heightened by
this address; and though I was fully convinced
that I was still dreaming, I felt an ardent curiosity
to hear an explanation of his meaning. I therefore
asked him, as I received the weapon, what
danger
threatened the safety or happiness of my
country. To which he answered:
The Wabash will run with human blood
before
the dawn of morning. Even now the
ambush
is laid, the tomahawk raised, and the
scalping-knife
sharpened. Treachery lurks round the
white men's camp. A prophet strikes at the
heart of your country: and all this is but the
bloody prelude of a long and more dreadful
contention
,
15
the result of which will depend on that of
the approaching battle.
If the valor of white
men foil the treachery and ferocity of the cruel foe,
then the Champions of Freedom will conquer in the
subsequent contest with a mighty empire
. If not
Washington has lived in vain, and the blood of
patriots flowed for nothing.
Admitting your assertion and prediction to be
true, I replied, still, why am
I
called upon?
There are thousands more capable of serving
their country, who possess hands to raise in her
defence.
You have a son, whom you devoted to his
country before you knew that he existed. Him
have I lately seen basking in the treacherous
sunshine of ease and pleasure. Rouse him
to a sense of his duty, and the high calling to
which he is destined. The day approaches that
will light him to the field. Before he can fully
acquire the art of defence, the soil of Freedom will
be prest by foreign hostile steps, and stained
with the blood of her children.
Prophet! spirit! angel! or devil! I
exclaimed
;
whatever you are, should the event of the
coming morning verify your prediction, I will
comply with your injunctions. Nay, moremy
son shall receive my consent to follow the bent of
his inclination, which I know will immediately
lead him from college to the army. But satisfy
me on one point: You seem to be a man; at any
rate you wear not the countenance of a demon;
how happens it that you bear so strong a
resemblance
to that picture?
Resemblances, answered he, are no proofs
of identity. Many a man has been mistaken for
another.
But tell me, said I, what is your name? to
what tribe do you belong?and how gained you
admittance here?
Your sister sleeps, said he, pointing to the
bed, without noticing my question; she will
shortly sleep to wake no more on earth.
My eyes were directed for a moment to your
aunt; she moved, and I flew to the couch. She
did not awake, and I returned to resume the
conference
with my mysterious guest; when, guess
my astonishment, he had disappeared! No door
had openedno footstep had soundedbut the
chief was nowhere to be found.
Surelysurely this is nothing but a dream!
I exclaimed with a vehemence that awakened the
nurse.
What is the matter, sir? cried she, starting
from the chair in which she had been so long
snoring by the side of the bed.
Matter! I exclaimedcome to me quick!
take hold of me! shake mewake me!
Wake you! repeated the good woman,
rubbing
her eyes, and then staring with the most
unaffected surprise'tant possible, sure, that
you are talking and walking in your sleep?
I made her no answer, for at that moment I
conceived a plan of ascertaining, the next day,
whether I had been thus imposed upon by an
illusive
dream or not, and this plan I resolved to put
into immediate execution. I opened my
escritoir
and wrote down the particulars as above stated,
which I deposited in a certain pigeon-hole, and
once more threw myself into the easy-chair, and
fell into an undisturbed slumber which lasted
until
after sunrise.
For nearly the whole day I avoided my
escritoir
,
being determined, in the first place, to
convince
myself fully that I was not only awake, but
in my right reason. I conversed a little with your
aunt, who had slept quietly till morning, and
seemed much relieved; I chatted a while with the
nurse, directed the threshers in the barns, visited
Cleveland, and transacted business with several
people; until every doubt was removed as to
the sanity of my mind, or the wakefulness of my
body. Then, towards evening, I ventured to look
for my singular narrative, and found it in the spot
where I left it; and yet, notwithstanding all this
mass of evidence, I almost doubted my own
senses.
A few days, however, removed all doubts
from my mind. Yesterday morning an express
passed the Grove on the way to Erie, bearing the
intelligence of a dreadful battle that was fought,
last Thursday morning
, by the army under
general
Harrison, with the combined Indians under
the Shawanoe prophet. As the particulars of this
battle may not have reached Boston, I will relate
them as far as communicated by the express,
who stopped a few minutes at my house for
refreshment
.
On the twenty-ninth of October last, the
governor
of Indiana, with a small army, left Fort
Harrison, on an expedition, the object of which
was to break up a combination formed by the
Shawanoe prophet on the Wabash, inimical to the
tranquility and interests of the United States.
After a long and hazardous march, they
reached the prophet's town on Wednesday, the
sixth instant. Here the general held a parley with
some chiefs who met him for that purpose, when
it was mutually agreed to suspend all further
discussion
until the next day, and that, in the mean
time, no hostile step should be taken on either
side.
The American army then encamped on the
banks of the Wabash, but were attacked the next
morning, a little after four o'clock, by a host of
savages, led by the treacherous prophet; and so
sudden and unexpected was the assault, that it
fared hard with many of our brave countrymen,
some of whom were scalped in their tents. The
Americans formed, however, with all possible
expedition
,
and after a sharp contest of two hours,
succeeded in beating them off with great loss, and
the victory was decided with the bayonet. Two
hundred fell wounded on our side, about seventy
of them never to rise again. A much larger
number
of the Indians were destroyed, and the
prophet's
town was burnt to ashes.
Thus, my son, was literally fulfilled one
prediction
of the
Mysterious Chief
. Who can this
being be? I am not superstitious; but `there are
things in heaven and earth not dreamt of in our
philosophy.' Is he supernatural? But I forbear
to ask questions of one as unable to satisfy these
doubts as I am myself. Whoever he be, I shall
comply with my engagement, and you have my
free consent to enter the army or navy as soon as
you please. The relinquishment of your studies
will be a great sacrifice, but if we are on the eve
of a war, as this unknown Indian has predicted, you
cannot too soon commence a military life. `In
time of peace prepare for war,' is the language
of the hero whose name you bear, and whose
sword you are to wield. I know your generous,
daring spirit, and unless it has been much
relaxed
by the new sphere in which you are
moving
,
your soul is now `in arms, and eager for the
15*
fray.' A very singular agent was made the
instrument
to announce your birth; a very singular
agent now claims your services for our common
country. `
I have a son to redeem my vow
.'
I possess sufficient influence at the seat of
government to procure you a commission, but
shall not apply for it until you accompany me
thither in person. I shall set out immediately for
Boston, so that you will not do wrong to expect
me in the first week of December. I have been
informed that a bill will be shortly laid before
congress
,
which will probably pass, for raising an
army of thirty thousand men, so that our
application
will be in good season.
As to the
marvellous
part of this letter, I would
recommend you to keep it a secret for the
present; possibly we may yet discover a clue to
unravel the mystery. The particulars of the
Wabash
battle will soon appear in all the
newspapers
.
It is probable that the account I have given
is not correct in all its parts.
Harrison, you have heard me mention, was
aid to the gallant Wayne, in the battle of your
birth-day; he is a man of fine talents, and
possesses
a perfect knowledge of the topography of
this state and the adjacent territories.
The pretended prophet who has thus led
these deluded people to ruin, is brother to that
Tecumseh, whose inveterate animosity against
the people of the United States you have heard
Logan mention. Some of the newspapers have
represented him to be Red Jacket, the celebrated
warrior who commanded the Indians by whom we
were defeated, in the year one thousand seven
hundred and ninety-two, under St. Clair. But
this I know to be incorrect. He was indeed in
that battle, but was then too young to command.
It is said that at the age of fifteen, this Indian
disappeared from his relatives, and was
considered
as finally lost; that he strolled to Quebec, and
from thence to Montreal, where he remained
several years; and in this space received an
education qualifying him to act the part of a
prophet
.
Among the sciences which he studied, that
of astronomy was his favorite, and the only one
in which he made any considerable proficiency.
By his calculations he discovered that a comet
was about to make its appearance, whose orbit
would approximate so near to that of our earth
as to give rise to that tremulous motion which has
lately been sensibly felt in several parts of the
United States, the earth alternately
preponderating
between two great attractive powers.
With this calculation of the cometary influence
in his pocket, the prophet left Quebec, and
immediately
set about forming the Wabash
combination
,
instigated, no doubt, by his hot-headed
brother, the fiery Tecumseh. He went on an
embassy to the Creeks, in the month of August
last, and required them to unite in the northern
coalition, and on their refusing, he solemnly
announced
,
in the public square, that `a
lamp
would shortly appear in the west to aid him in his
hostile attack upon the whites; and that if they
would not be influenced by his persuasion, the
earth would ere long tremble to its centre.'
The lamp
is
in the westthe earth
has
shaken. No wonder that these circumstances
should have had a powerful effect on the minds of
these untutored Indians, and tended greatly to
strengthen the confederacy. I shall be but a few
days behind this letter.
Adieu.
CHAPTER XIX.
HOSTILE INDICATIONS.
Peace itself should not so dull a nation
(Though war, nor no known quarrel were in question)
But that defences, musters, preparations,
Should be maintain'd, assembled, and collected,
As were a war in expectation.
Shaks. Henry V.
On
the fifth day of December, major
Willoughby
again embraced his children. He arrived in
Boston, but repaired immediately to Cambridge,
and had a long conference with his son, who
almost
petrified him with astonishment by
recounting
his own interview with the
Mysterious Chief
,
at the masquerade, on the same night, and nearly
in the same hour that his father conversed with a
similar being, on the same subject, in the state of
Ohio! Both felt a conviction that it was a call to
duty which ought immediately to be obeyed; and,
under this impression, our young hero took a
formal
leave of the illustrious seminary to which he
had already become an ornament.
The tenth day of the month had been
appointed
for the nuptial ceremony to crown the
happiness
of four amiable beings; but, since the death
of her aunt, Amelia had petitioned that the event
might be deferred until the following summer,
and urged as her reason, the impropriety of being
married in sables. But to this proposition she
gained no assenting voice, and it was at length
overruled by the major himself, who refused to
admit that the death of the
old
was a rational
cause for delaying the happiness of the
young
,
and the ceremony accordingly took place on the
day appointed.
Amelia and Ellen had been but three days
brides, when the sunshine of their felicity was
overcast with a temporary cloud that produced a
plentiful shower before it was dissipated. To
speak without a figure, their parting with George
was a most affecting scene, particularly to Amelia,
who had never existed a fortnight without
embracing
her brother, since his birth. His absence
was now to be indefiniteunlimitedperhaps
hazardous.
But the reader's patience need not be intruded
on. Let it suffice, that major Willoughby and
his son took lodgings in the city of Washington
near Capitol hill, on the eighteenth of the month.
Congress was then in session, and the city, as
usual, so filled with strangers, that our new comers
found it extremely difficult to get suitably
accommodated
.
An approaching rupture with England was
here openly talked of, both by members of the
cabinet, and by individuals in both houses of
Congress
.
The bill for increasing the army was in
debate, and daily gaining ground and popularity;
our hero, therefore, lost no time in filing an
application
in the war department for an ensigncy in the
United States infantry. From the weight of the
recommendations
which accompanied this
application
,
no doubt was entertained of its success, and
the major was determined to continue with his
son until his final destination was known; in the
mean time, however, he received a pressing
invitation
to spend the holidays with a friend in
Richmond, and accordingly set out for that place,
on the morning of the twenty-second, accompanied
by George, and arrived there in season for
celebrating
the festival of Christmas.
On the following day they dined with a select
party at the house of his excellency, George W.
Smith, governor of Virginia, where our hero met
with an opportunity, for which he had long sighed,
of cultivating an acquaintance with those who, like
himself, had chosen the profession of arms.
Several officers of the army and navy were
present
,
and among the latter class was lieutenant
Gibbon. This amiable, brave, and
accomplished
young man, was the son of a revolutionary
officer who had valiantly served his country
in the times which tried men's souls.
Possessing
an enterprizing disposition, young
Gibbon
had early entered as a midshipman, and
was now a lieutenant in the navy; he had
served in the Mediterranean, and was on board
the Philadelphia frigate when that ship fell into
the power of the Tripolitans. Long and tedious
were the months of his captivity, but he submitted
to every privation and hardship without a
murmur
;
his unbending fortitude rose superior to
calamity
,
and bore him up through all the miseries
his oppressors could inflict.
After his release from captivity, and his return
to his native country, he contracted an attachment
for a lovely female in Richmond, which was
rewarded
with a reciprocal sentiment. This young
lady possessed every requisite to insure happiness
in the conjugal state; virtue, beauty, wealth, and
every fascinating accomplishment, enriched her in
an eminent degree, and Gibbon was now anxiously
awaiting the happy day which was to crown his
wishes, and make him supremely blest.
Preliminaries
were already arranged, the bower of
felicity was before him, and the path to happiness
seemed short and easy.
Such was the character, and such were the
prospects of lieutenant Gibbon, when George
was introduced to him at Richmond. He took
his leave of the party at an early hour; not,
however, without assuring major Willoughby
(who had been intimate with his father) that he
would pay his respects to him on the following
day at his lodgings, and receiving the promise of
George to join him at the theatre in the course of
the evening.
CHAPTER XX.
A DISASTROUS EVENT.
Whence the wild wail of agonizing wo
That heaves each breast, and bids each eye o'erflow?
Ab, me! amid the all-involving gloom
That wraps the victims of terrific doom,
While palsied Fancy casts an anguish'd glance,
What frenzied spectres to my view advance!
Appalled Nature shrinksmy harrow'd soul
Dares not the direful scene of death unrol!
Anon
.
An
interesting play, entitled
Family Feuds
,
had been announced for representation at the
theatre, for the benefit of Placide; and the
governor
,
with several of his friends, proposed to
patronize
the performance. The Major declined
the proposition, but his son accompanied the
party.
It was the best house the season had afforded,
and the play went off with great
eclat
. The
afterpiece
was the interesting pantomime of the
Bleeding Nun
, which commenced amid the
plaudits of the admiring audience. George had
read the eccentric romance from which this
pantomime
was selected, and consequently the plot of
the piece was familiar to his recollection. The
gallant Raymond saves his beloved Agnes from
the most imminent danger, and bears her away
in his arms. George thought of his Catharine,
and, when the curtain fell on the first act, sat
absorbed
in tender recollections. How happy,
thought he, must that lover be who saves from
destruction the idol of his soul! What rapture
must be mingled with the sensations which heave
their meeting bosoms, as he afterwards presses her
in his arms! Grant, O my God, that I may be
placed
in such a blissful situation; grant that
Catharine
may owe her precious life to my courage and
exertions; permit and enable me but to bear her
from danger in these longing arms, and I ask no
more!
A most delightful piece of music from the
orchestra awoke him from the pleasing reverie,
and he gazed around on the happy faces that
every where met his view.
On no former occasion had the theatre of
Richmond
exhibited a more brilliant assemblage of
beauty, taste and fashion; and never, perhaps,
was such an assembly more disposed to be happy.
Every bosom bounded with pleasureevery eye
beamed with satisfaction; care was forgotten,
and incessant flashes of wit and merriment
bespoke
the lightness of the hearts from whence they
emanated.
The curtain rose on the second act of the
pantomime
,
the orchestra was in full chorus, and an
actor came forward to open the scene, when
sparks of fire were seen to fall on the back part of
the stage, and Robertson advanced, waving his
hand to the ceiling, and exclaiming that the house
was on fire! His hand was immediately stretched
forth to the persons in the stage box to help them
on the stage, and aid their retreat in that direction.
The heart-appalling cry of
fire! fire!
now passed
with electric velocity through the house, and all
who were not rendered insensible by terror,
flew from their seats to gain the lobbies and stairs.
The scene that ensued baffles all description.
The most heart-piercing cries pervaded the house,
of
Save me! O save me!
Wives calling for
their husbands, females and children shrieking,
while the gathering volumes of pitchy smoke
came rolling onward, extinguishing the lights, and
choaking respiration. Many were trodden under
foot, the stairs were blocked up, and men, women,
and children precipitated themselves from the
windows into the street below, some with their
garments in a blaze, and their persons dreadfully
burnt. The governor, in attempting to save his
child, perished with it, and several of the party
in his box shared the same dreadful fate.
George was in the adjoining box, with his new
friend Gibbon, who had under his protection the
young lady to whom he was affianced. When
the tumult arose her sensibility was overpowered
and she fainted; her lover raised her in his arms,
and endeavored to force his way through the
crowd; George offered his assistance, which
Gibbon
declined, declaring himself to be competent
to the task, and entreating our hero to assist two
young ladies, who had fallen in the next box, and
were apparently without protectors. With great
coolness and intrepidity Gibbon then continued
to make his way through the opposing multitude,
until exhausted with his exertions, and overtaken
by the flames, he sunk with his lovely burden to
rise no more!
16
Our hero instantly perceived that the passage
from the pit offered the most probable chance of
safety, and raising the young ladies who had
fainted from terror in an adjoining box, he took
one in each arm, leaped into the pit, and bore his
insensible burdens, through the thick smoke and
scorching flames, until he gained in safety the
semi-circular avenue which led him to the door of
the theatre. Here the fresh air partially
revived
the almost suffocated objects of his care, and
they gained the street a few minutes before the
roof fell in.
My sister! exclaimed a gentleman, and
snatched one of the ladies from the arms of her
preserver. He bore the other through the
distracted
crowd, and seated her on a stone at the
corner of the street. Here she appeared to
awake at once to all the horrors of her situation,
and starting up, with a piercing shriek, flew with
such velocity towards the scene of conflagration
that our hero could hardly overtake her. She
sunk again into his arms, exclaiming, in a tone
that thrilled George to the soul
Save my
father! O save my dear father!
The fire at that
moment shone full on her faceit was Catharine.
They were in the midst of a scene that it is
impossible
to describe. Women with dishevelled
hair, calling on their husbands; fathers and
mothers shrieking for their children; husbands for
their wives, and brothers for their sisters, filled the
whole area on the outside of the blazing ruins.
Some, who had escaped, were plunging again
into the flames, to save some dear object of their
regard; others were frantic, and would have
rushed to destruction, but for the restraining hand
of a friend. The bells were ringing, and the
whole town rushing to the fatal spot.
What a spectacle here awaited the
horror-struck
citizens of Richmond! a whole theatre
enwrapped
in flames, a gay and animated assembly
suddenly thrown on the very verge of the grave
many of them precipitated into eternity! Virtue,
genius, beauty, youth, and old age, whelmed in
one promiscuous ruin! shrieks of agony mingled
with the crackling flames!
Our hero had hitherto preserved his presence
of mind! but recognising Catharine at that
dreadful
moment, and the uncertainty of her father's
fate, on whom she was still calling with the voice
of distraction, almost unmanned him; his brain
was bewildered, and it was with difficulty that he
could support the lovely girl in his arms. At that
moment he found himself supported by the arm of
his father.
Take her, cried George; to you I can
entrust
her. Bear her to a place of safety, while I
seek her father.
Exhausted, and almost lifeless, she hung on
the major's arm, who, with the assistance of a
young officer whom he called to his aid,
supported
her to the nearest house, which by this time
had become a hospital filled with those who had
escaped with fractured limbs, dreadful bruises,
and dangerous burns. But in the general
consternation
,
individual griefs could not be attended
to. Every one was flying in search of some near
relative or dear connexion, and the wounded and
dying were left to condole each other with their
groans.
Catharine, who had not been recognized by the
major, was in a kind of stupor not unlike a swoon,
and in that state was left in the care of the officer
who assisted in removing her from the scene of
danger, while Willoughby returned to assist his
son in his humane exertions.
Notwithstanding the dreadful scene around
him, the young stranger could not refrain from
gazing on the beautiful insensible reclining on his
arm. Her hair was loose, and floated wildly
over her shoulders and neck; her eyes were
closed, her bosom heaved, and her whole dress
was disordered. He rudely gazed on charms thus
heightened by distress, and almost forgot the
disaster
that had submitted them to his inspection.
In a few minutes a man rushed into the room,
whose scorched and disfigured dress scarcely
retained any distinguishing marks of the sex to
which it belonged. He was without a hat, and
his head was severely burnt. Where is she?
he exclaimedO where is my child? and
Catharine was pressed to her father's bosom,
where she soon recovered her recollection, and
expressed her joy in tears and sobs.
As soon as she became sufficiently composed,
they repaired to their lodgings, accompanied by
the officer, who insisted upon seeing his charge
in perfect safety before he thought of his own
concerns
.
O my generous preserver! faintly exclaimed
Catharine as he seated her on a sofa, how
shall I express my thanks?
Your thanks are only due to Heaven,
answered he; I have only done my duty; and
had I lost my life in snatching
you
from the
flames
How were you so fortunate as to save her?
interrupted Fleming.
Officer
. I saw her fall in the lobby, sir, and
flew to her assistance. The pressure of the crowd
was so great, and the smoke so suffocating, that I
almost despaired of success; but was resolved to
save or perish with her.
Fleming
. But why such an interest for her
fate in particular, among hundreds who were in
situations equally perilous, and who possessed
equal claims to your assistance? Are you
acquainted
with us?
Officer
. No, sir. ButI sat in the next box
to you this evening. I saw your daughterI
accidentally heard her appropriate and judicious
observationsI felt that she was worthy the risk
I ran.
As he said this he gently pressed her hand,
which he held in his.
Fleming
. Why did you not tarry in the box,
my child, as I requested? I was back in a
moment, after ascertaining that it was easy to
escape through the pit. What was my horror on
not finding you in the spot where I had left you!
I leaped into the boxes, and rushed into the lobby,
calling on your name, but could nowhere find
you. Overcome with suffocation, I fell to the
floor, with my head against the wall. A little
stream of fresh air issuing through a crack, revived
me, and I again arose, with a determination to
leap from the window, which was at that moment
burst open. When I had nearly reached it,
however, I almost despaired of effecting my
escape through it, for the crowds that blocked it
up. I pushed forward with desperation, while
many dropped on all sides of me to rise no more.
I mounted on the heads of the crowd, with my hair
and clothes on fire, burst through the window, and
reached the ground in safety. Here I again
called
aloud on your name, and ran like a madman
among the multitude to find you, and was even on
the point of rushing back into the flames, when a
16*
friendly hand restrained me. I know not who,
but some one called me by name, and told me that
my daughter was in safety at the house we have
just left. I hastened thither, and found you
insensible
,
tenderly supported by this gentleman,
who has risked his own life to preserve yours.
Had I a thousand lives, sir, they should all be
devoted
to the preserver of my child. How shall
we express our gratitude?
Officer
. You pain me, sir, by this language.
I am richly rewarded by the consciousness of
having
preserved this lady. Do not lessen my
happiness
by talking of gratitude.
Here he again pressed the hand of Catharine,
and added in a whisperI will not object to
your
thanking me, for then I shall again hear that
angelic voice. Catharine, however, was silent,
withdrew her hand, and sighed deeply. In the
next moment she burst into tears, and exclaimed
aloud, O, why was I preserved!
Be composed, my child, said Fleming,
pressing
her to his bosom; the dreadful scene of this
evening has affected you too deeply. Permit
Mrs. Crosby (the lady of the house) to conduct
you to your chamber. Repose will, I hope,
restore
both your health and recollection.
Catharine complied in silence, and was
consigned
to the care of a faithful nurse; while Mrs.
Crosby returned with cordials, balsams, and
plasters
,
for the wounds of her father, which now
began
to pain him extremely. The officer rose to
take his leave.
We must see you again, when more
composed
,
said Fleming, in order to thank you as
we ought. In the mean time, oblige us with your
name.
The stranger hesitated a moment, and then
answered
Thomas
Sandford. I must now tear
myself away to assist other sufferers in this
dreadful
disaster, but will most certainly see you
again
.
Major Willoughby and his son were prevented
by an accident from following Fleming
immediately
to the house to which his daughter had
been conductedaccompany him they could not,
for his speed outstript the wind. George, however,
was there in a few minutes after their departure,
but no Catharine was to be seen, nor could he,
from all his inquiries, find any one that might
assist him in the search. His father had left her
in the care of an officer, but who he was, or
whither he was gone, he was totally ignorant.
Trusting, however, that both daughter and father
were in safety, he hoped to discover their
lodgings
on the following morning, and therefore
retired
to his own, to snatch a little necessary
repose
.
CHAPTER XXI.
DISSIMULATION.
Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed;
For he's disposed as the hateful raven.
Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him;
For he's inclin'd as is the ravenous wolf.
Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?
Shaks. Henry VI
.
When
Sandford withdrew from Harvard
University
,
to avoid the disgrace of a public
expulsion
,
he turned his attention to a military life;
and, through the influence of his mother's friends,
obtained a captain's commission, and assumed
the command of a small garrison in the state of
Virginia. He anticipated no hostilities, and only
aspired to become the hero of a drawing-room,
and display a rich uniform on a holiday parade.
He had contracted an intimacy with several young
dashers
of similar character, and squandered, at
brothels and the gaming-table, not only all his
pay, but also the bountiful supplies remitted him
by his mother.
The alarming cry of fire had, this evening,
interrupted a game at billiards, in which he was
engaged, and he was approaching the scene of
conflagration as an idle spectator, when major
Willoughby requested his assistance in
conveying
his lovely charge to a place of safety, with
so much earnestness, that he could not refuse.
But, no sooner had he obtained a full view of the
charming but senseless Catharine, than his
fiend-like
heart conceived the horrid idea of her
seduction
,
and he only awaited her return to life and
recollection to convey her far distant from the
reach of her friends, if she had any to seek
after her.
This diabolical plan, however, was frustrated
by the sudden appearance of her father; when
it was immediately changed to another of equal
enormity, though of less precipitancy. He would
accompany them to their lodgings, claim the
merit of the daughter's preservation, engage her
gratitude, and all the rest was easy to
accomplish
.
The ready lie he invented appeared very
plausible, and both father and daughter were
elated
with gratitude.
So far he was successful; but could he have
read the pure heart he was studying to corrupt,
he would have discovered an image, which she
was contemplating at the very moment when
he flattered himself that his own was imparting
an impression there. She withdrew her hand,
and sighed, while reflections like the following
crowded on her mind:
O that George Willoughby had been my
preserver
!
But he is far off, and knew not the
danger
of his Catharine. How unhappy would he
have been, had I perished like the rest!
Compared
with his, the anguish of such a death would
have been trifling and momentary. O my God,
teach me to be sufficiently grateful that he is
spared such a trial. But whither am I
wandering
?
Foolish girl! Perhaps he has forgotten
me! Perhaps he loves another! If that should
be the case,
O why was I preserved?
Here busy thought burst through the organs of
speech, and the exclamation (as before stated)
was imputed by her father to a temporary
delirium
.
Sandford failed not in the promised repetition
of his visit. He called early the next day, and
found Fleming confined to his bed, in a high
fever, with his daughter sitting by the side of his
pillow, watching over him with the tenderest
anxiety. She rose as he entered the room, and
with a faint smile presented him her hand, which
he pressed with fervor to his lips. She
disapproved
of his freedom, but felt too much
depression
of spirits to chide any oneleast of all the
preserver of her life. Her father was in a
disturbed
slumber, interrupted by frequent starts
and unintelligible exclamations. His left temple
was severely burnt, and the whole side of his
head extremely swelled and inflamed. Besides
this, he had received a dangerous contusion on
the right shoulder, in his fall from the window of
the theatre. His physician, however, assured
Catharine that rest and tranquility would speedily
restore him.
It was no time for Sandford to introduce the
topic of love; he only indirectly intimated what
would have been his theme under more happy
auspices. At the present interview, he
contented
himself with tender glances, affectionate
tones, and the most respectful attentions. He
pretended to have passed a sleepless morning,
merely from his fears on her account, and should
now continue excessively unhappy until her dear
father was restored to health. Catharine was
melted with gratitude for such kindness in a
stranger
,
and, on his taking leave, could do no less
than mingle a general visiting invitation with her
thanks; all of which this paragon of vanity
interpreted
in favor of his unhallowed wishes.
In the mean time, major Willoughby and his
son were seeking in vain to discover the lodgings
of Fleming and his daughter. The whole city
was in tears, and their inquiries were
disregarded
.
On the day following the dreadful event, an
extraordinary meeting of the city council was
held, at which four gentlemen were appointed
as a committee to superintend the funeral rites
due to those unfortunate sufferers whose remains
might not be claimed by relatives; to cause them
to be collected and enclosed in urns, coffins, or
other suitable receptacles, and publicly interred,
with all proper respect and solemnity, and to
give notice to the citizens of Richmond and
Manchester of the time at which such interment
would take place. This committee were also
empowered to cause suitable monuments to be
erected over their ashes, with such inscriptions
as would be best calculated to record the
melancholy
and affecting catastrophe.
The council also recommended an entire
suspension
of business for forty-eight hours; and
ordained, that for four months thereafter, no
public show or spectacle, or open dancing
assembly
should be exhibited or held in the city, under
a heavy penalty.
A very numerous meeting of the citizens was
held at the Capitol the same day, at which
another
committee was appointed, to inquire into the
causes of this afflicting calamity, to trace the
particulars
of its disastrous progress, and to
ascertain
the extent of its melancholy effects. From
the report of this committee, it appeared that
eighty-five persons had perished in this dreadful
conflagration.
For several days the Willoughbys continued
their search; but compelled at length to
relinquish
the vain pursuit, George accompanied his
father to Washington, almost in a state of
despair
.
He
had
clasped Catharine in his arms; nay,
morehe had saved her precious life, and
rescued
her from the most dreadful of deaths. This
was a literal answer to his impious prayer. Had
it made him happy? Alas! nohe was
miserable
in the extreme. Vain, presumptuous man!
Were heaven literally to grant every wish of our
selfish hearts, earth would soon become a hell, and
universal damnation succeed. No supplication
should ever rise from the human heart to which
an earthly idea is attachednothing, relative to
the dispensations of Providence, but
thy will be
done
, should ever pass the human lips. We
are expressly forbidden to pray or even to take
thought for
temporal
blessings; and are as
expressly
promised, that if we seek first for
spiritual
ones, the others shall be added thereto.
Not happiness herself makes good her aim,
Our very wishes give us not our wish.
Many letters of inquiry were sent to Richmond,
but no tidings could be obtained of Fleming or
his daughter. On the second day of January the
army act became a law, and, in ten days after,
our hero received his commission, and was
attached
to a regiment then raising in the District
of Columbia. Here his father took leave of
him, (after presenting him with the sword of
Washington) and departed for the western
country
,
promising to write immediately on his
reaching
Mulberry-grove, and communicate every
information
he could procure respecting the fate of
Fleming and his daughter; as they must have
either set out for that country, or written to Mrs.
Fleming an account of their present situation.
CHAPTER XXII.
TREACHERY UNMASKED.
He has profaned the sacred name of friend,
And worn it into vileness:
With how secure a brow and specious form
He gilds the secret villain! Sure, that face
Was meant for honesty, but Heav'n mismatch'd it;
And furnish'd Treason out with Nature's pomp,
To make its work more easy.
Dryd. All for Love
.
About
three months previous to the foregoing
event, Fleming received letters advising him that
the agent, to whose fraudulent conduct he imputed
the sudden reduction of his fortune, had
emigrated
,
with immense wealth, to America, and
was settled in some part of Pennsylvania, near
Philadelphia. As Fleming had many reasons for
wishing to obtain an interview with this man, he
resolved upon making a journey to that state; and
it was agreed that Catharine should accompany
him as far as Pittsburg, on a visit to a female
relation
,
with whom she was to remain until her
father's return. At New-Lisbon, however, he
learned that this relation was dead, and her
children
removed to Philadelphia; he therefore
altered
his plan, and, without stopping at Pittsburg,
took his daughter with him to Philadelphia.
At Lancaster, where they rested two days, he
obtained some information of the object of his
journey. Patrick Dobson had lately sold a
considerable
farm on the banks of the Susquehanna,
and become a commission merchant in one of the
southern cities; but in which of them, his
informant
could not tell.
17
After a short stay in Philadelphia, they
travelled
to Baltimore, and from thence to Norfolk,
where Fleming learned that Dobson was then in
Richmond, to which place they immediately
returned
.
Here terminated their fruitless journey,
for Dobson had sailed for the Indies a few days
before their arrival.
For several days after the disastrous event
which had confined Fleming to his chamber,
Sandford was punctual in his visits, and affected
the greatest solicitude for his indisposition.
During
these interviews, he let slip no opportunity
of acting the diffident lover, when unobserved
by Fleming; and so great an adept was he in
dissimulation, that a less artless girl than
Catharine
might have been deceived. She possessed
too much discernment to misunderstand the silent
language of love, which is most eloquent when
least audible; but she knew too little of the
world to detect a counterfeit, or to distinguish it
from a genuine passion. She perceived with
pain, that in her preserver's bosom was kindling
an attachment which she could not return. She
owed her life to his intrepidity, but could never
repay the debt with that heart which she had
long reserved for another. Although no express
declaration or engagement had ever been
interchanged
by George and Catharine, yet their
dove-like affection for each other hand produced
in both a kind of intuitive idea of obligationa
sympathy in sentiment which absence had only
tended to heighten, while its reciprocity was
admitted
as a matter of course.
With this sentiment in her bosom, it would be
embarrassing to hear the professions of another,
and painful in the extreme, if that other should
be the man to whom she was under such immense
obligations. She trembled to think of it, and
ardently prayed that her father's returning health
might speedily enable him to take her from
Richmond
,
and save her the painful trial she
anticipated
.
Her prayer was not answered.
Fleming slowly recovered; but, before his
health was sufficiently re-established for him to
commence so long a journey, Sandford had laid
a regular siege to the citadel of Catharine's
heart. Mistaking her gratitude for affection, he
persevered with a zeal deserving a better cause,
notwithstanding her prompt rejection of his
overtures
,
and positive refusal to capitulate.
Fortunately for Catharine, the impatience and
impetuosity of the assailant defeated his own
plans, and shortened the period of contest. He
grew unguarded and daring, and made
movements
(too openly for their object to be mistaken)
against the fortress of virtue. Catharine felt
shocked and degraded by the discovery, but
reaped an advantage from it which she could not
otherwise have acquired. All obligation was, in
one moment, absolved by the villany of his
intentions
.
The wretch was entitled to no gratitude
for preserving life, who could rob its possessor of
all that renders life desirableinnocence and
happiness. The debt was cancelled, and she
forbade him her sight, in terms that he durst not
disobey. Although he wore an epaulet, he was
too great a coward to run the risk to which
Catharine's
complaint to her father would have
inevitably
exposed him; he therefore took the hint she
gave, and discontinued his visits. She soon
after left Richmond with her father, and arrived
home in health and safety, a few days before
major Willoughby reached Mulberry-Grove, who
immediately communicated the circumstance to
his anxious son.
But Sandford had acquired a secret which made
him resolve to persevere (at a more convenient
opportunity) in his iniquitous pursuit. In one of
his interviews with Fleming, the name of
Willoughby
was mentioned, and a few inquiries
convinced
him that his daughter was that very
Catharine
Fleming whose name, connected with the
tenderest sentiments, had been confided to his
treacherous bosom by the unsuspecting George.
The disgrace of a blow, yet unatoned for, rankled
in his breast, and he still smarted under the
indignity
,
which he had not the courage openly to
resent. But to seduce the affections of his
adversary's
mistress, enjoy her charms, and then
abandon her to infamy and misery, would be a
sweet revenge! a triumph worthy of Sandford!
Thus urged on by a double impulse, he
became
too ardent in his advances, and, as before
intimated, was dismissed in disgrace.
Revenge alone now took entire possession of
his soul, and he swore that no obstacle, time, or
circumstance, should prevent its final
gratification
.
May Heaven's curses blast me, he
exclaimed
as he traversed his chamber alone, the
wretched victim of passions which he had never
yet undertaken to subdue; may hell's fiercest
lightnings consume me, if I do not humble this
proud Hibernian, with all her affected virtue, and
mar the anticipated banquet of her sighing
savage
lover. He may wear the flower, after I have
sipped its sweets, and engendered a venomous
canker in its bosom. Yes! I will seek her in
the wilds of Ohio, or follow her to the end of the
world; and when we
do
meet, whether it be
sooner or later, whether she be single or married,
young or old, I will enjoy her; nor shall Heaven,
earth, or hell, prevent me!
With this terrible oath on his lips, and such
tempestuous passions in his heart, the wretched
Sandford dared address himself to sleep.
CHAPTER XXIII.
THE SOLDIER'S PROGRESS.
Ambition never was my view,
Though glory still has been my great pursuit;
I would, by noble actions in her service,
Deserve the utmost honors of my country;
Nor higher do my thoughts affect to rise.
Frowd's Fall of Sag
.
Beloved
and respected by all who were worthy
of his esteem, our young ensign applied himself
incessantly to the study of military tactics, and
in the course of three months outstript all his
competitors in the theory of war, and ardently
longed for an honorable occasion to reduce this
theory to practice. During this period he had
the satisfaction of becoming acquainted with many
persons of worth and distinction, from whose
conversation, manners, and experience, he
acquired
no little benefit.
About the last of February, at Mrs. Madison's
levee, he was introduced to commodore
Bainbridge
,
who had just returned from a commercial
voyage, for the prosecution of which he had
obtained
a furlough from the navy department. This
gallant officer was now thirty-eight years of age,
and for twenty years had been a ploughman of the
17*
deep. He served with honor and success during
the contest with France, and in the year eighteen
hundred, received a captain's commission, when
he was appointed to the command of the frigate
George Washington, in which he shortly
afterwards
sailed for Algiers with the presents which
the United States were by treaty bound to make
to that regency. From Algiers he visited
Constantinople
,
where he gave the Turks a high idea
of the naval character of the United States, and
returned to America in the month of April in the
following year. In a few months after, he received
the command of the frigate Essex, in which he
again scoured the Mediterranean, to assist in
chastising the insolence of the Barbarians, and
after a cruise of twelve months, returned to
New-York
.
In the year one thousand eight hundred and
three, he was appointed to command the
Philadelphia
,
a frigate built by the merchants of the city
whose name she bore, and by them presented to
the government. In her he once more sailed for
the Mediterranean to join the American squadron
under the command of commodore Preble. The
unfortunate fate of this vessel has already been
alluded to in a former chapter. Bainbridge,
Gibbon, and the rest, became the captives of a
barbarous and mercenary foe.
When the termination of the Tripolitan war
restored Bainbridge, with his gallant associates,
to the bosom of their sympathising country, he
was received (says his biographer) rather as
a returning conqueror than as a vanquished
prisoner
a
most unequivocal proof of public
confidence
,
since that merit must indeed be sterling
which could stand the test of such misfortunes.
Young Willoughby failed not to cultivate so
valuable an acquaintance. In the society of the
brave and generous only, he could find souls
congenial
to his own; and as the sentiment was
mutual, they were equally assiduous to conciliate
his esteem. His intimacy with Bainbridge,
however
,
was soon interrupted by the departure of
that gentleman for New-England, he having been
appointed to the command of the navy-yard at
Charlestown in Massachusetts, and of the public
vessels on the eastern station.
About the same time, in consequence of some
new arrangements in the organization of the
army
,
the officers of several regiments were
transferred
to others, and ensign Willoughby received
orders to report himself to the commandant of a
military post in the neighborhood of Norfolk. It
was early in March when he obeyed these orders,
and performed a journey of above two hundred
miles, over roads which the season had rendered
horrid beyond description. The general aspect
of the country was as dreary as the hoisterous
month in which he surveyed it, and every thing
conspired to make the change disagreeable. But
the duty of obedience was familiar to George,
and even where its performance was painful, it
was always accompanied with cheerfulness.
As the spring advanced, however, our hero
found his new situation very pleasant. When off
duty he enjoyed frequent excursions through the
beautiful scenes of Virginiasometimes in
contemplative
solitude, but more frequently in the
gay company of military and naval officers. The
probability that an opportunity would be soon
afforded of distinguishing themselves in the
service
of their country, was the untired theme,
which gave an additional zest to these enjoyments,
cherished the love of glory in their bosoms, and
kept alive the hope of its speedy gratification.
Although George
thought
as a hero, he yet
felt
as a man. Glory was the idol of his soul,
but it was the glory of asserting and defending
the rights of his country, not that of butchering his
fellow-creatures. He knew that the golden halo
might be, and often had been, won in an
unrighteous
cause; but he felt that one drop of
unnecessary
blood would so dim its lustre in the eye of
virtue
,
that a genuine patriot would behold it with
horror and spurn it with contempt. Much as he
wished for fame, he would never seek it
out
of the
path of duty; if it were attainable
in
that path, he
was willing to encounter danger in its direst form
to reach the glittering goal. He wished for war,
because he thought it the only measure by which
the honor and rights of his country could be
maintained. Had not the patriots of my father's
day, thought he, resorted to the same dreadful
alternative, when their rights were invaded,
their sons would at this day have had no rights to
protect; and ought we not to do as much for our
posterity as our fathers have done for us?
The genuine principles of patriotism had been
inculcated into him from an infant; the love of
country was interwoven with his very existence;
and a desire of serving her was the ruling
passion
of his heart. The conversation of his
father
,
the education of his childhood, and the books
he had read, all tended to render this principle
permanent and lasting. It was too deep-rooted
ever to be effaced. It occupied his daily
thoughts, and intruded on his midnight dreams;
it was the theme of his conversation in
company
,
and the subject of his meditations in all his
private walks.
In one of his solitary rambles, through the
most romantic parts of Norfolk county,
Where rural sweets and sylvan shades
Conspire to yield delight,
he found himself bewildered with cross-roads,
and stopped at a genteel-looking house to
inquire
the way to the village, where he had left
his horse. The sun had set, and the sombre
shades of evening had already begun to descend
on the valleys, as he knocked at the door. He
was received in a very courteous manner, by a
gentleman, who informed him that the village
was five miles distant, and the road not easily
explored
by a stranger in darkness; he was
therefore
pressed to tarry all night, to which, after
some common-place apologies for the intrusion,
he consented, and was entertained with all that
generous hospitality which so eminently
characterises
the inhabitants of Virginia.
Every thing like reserve, on either side, was
quickly dissipated, and both host and guest
became
mutually pleased with each other. The
name of the gentleman to whom our hero was
thus accidentally introduced was Vaughan, a
very respectable citizen, and an excellent man.
He soon discovered in his guest a mind of no
common cast, and listened with admiration to
sentiments
and aphorisms that would have become
the lips of aged wisdom. Though the opinions
and arguments of George were always expressed
with peculiar modesty, they yet displayed a depth
of thinking and a knowledge of the world that
seldom failed of raising the speaker in the
estimation
of his opponent.
On the present occasion our hero had
imperceptibly
introduced his favourite topic, the
necessity
of demanding of England a redress of
national
grievances, and of making the demand
from the cannon's mouth. He entertained no
doubt that government felt this necessity, and that
congress would shortly pass a law to that effect.
But whatever might have been the opinion of his
host as to the necessity of a war, that gentleman
doubted the speedy occurrence of such an event.
Negociation appeared to be the favorite policy
of the government, and that policy would
probably
still be adhered to. Many arguments were
used in support of these different opinions.
It is natural to believe what we wish, at
length observed Vaughan; and you gentlemen
of the army appear to be much more sanguine on
this point than those who are attached to the
navy. The reason may be, that many of the
latter
already wear those laurels which the former
are so eager to acquire.
Some gentlemen of the navy, with whom I
have conversed, replied George, are not less
sanguine
on this subject than myself. The gallant
Bainbridge, several weeks since, expressed it as
his decided opinion that the present session of
congress would not terminate without a
declaration
of war.
Do you know lieutenant Elliot? asked
Vaughan.
Of the army?
No, sir, of the Navy.
Only by report, replied George; his
father
,
Robert Elliot, was unfortunately slain by
the Indians
[13]
[13]
See Chap. ii. p. 7.
in the same campaign, under
general
Wayne, in which my father lost a hand. I
have often heard my father speak of him as a
very particular friend, and that his death was the
greatest misfortune he had,
at that time
, ever met
with. Of the son I know nothing, but have
heard that he sustained the reputation of a brave
young man while a midshipman in the
Mediterranean
.
He has since been promoted.
Yes, sir, in June, eighteen hundred and ten,
he was appointed acting lieutenant on board the
Enterprize; and has since been sent with
dispatches
to Mr. Pinkney, our minister in London.
Last year he served in the John Adams until
September
,
when he was transferred to the Argus, on
board of which he now acts as first lieutenant,
although at present he is on a short furlough.
During all this time, he has been preparing his
mind for the severe duties of his profession, under
the same impression which actuates yourself, the
hope of a speedy opportunity of signalizing
himself
in his country's service.
And does not that hope revive at the present
indications of a rupture with England? asked
George.
He can perceive no such indications,
replied
Vaughan; or else he interprets them wrong.
To use the language of an elegant writer, he is
`fatigued in the chase of glory's brilliant
visions
that still sparkle over his head, and still
elude his grasp;' he has therefore resigned his
mind to the sway of the more endearing passions.
I understand you, said George with a smile,
he is in love.
To-morrow, sir, replied Vaughan, with the
permission of Providence, I shall call him
son
.
I beg leave to congratulate you, sir, on the
accession
to your family of so amiable a member.
I thank you, sir; and in return, if the duties of
your profession will not imperiously forbid it, I
shall take the liberty of insisting that you tarry
with us to-morrow, and honor the ceremony with
your presence.
After some hesitation, our hero consented, and
it now growing late, he was conducted to a
chamber, and left to repose.
At breakfast, the next morning, (which was
Sunday) he was introduced to the intended bride,
the lovely Frances, blushing like the season, and,
in a short time after, to the son of his father's
friend, the gallant youth who was about to lead
her to the altar of Hymen. They seemed mated
by Heaven, and worthy of each other.
A matchless pair,
With equal virtue formed, and equal grace,
The same, distinguished by their sex alone;
Hers the mild lustre of the blooming morn,
And his the radiance of the risen day.
On the morning following their nuptials our hero
bid the happy pair adieu, and taking a respectful
leave of their hospitable parents, proceeded to the
village for his horse, and returned to his quarters.
Here an unexpected pleasure awaited him. A
packet of letters was put into his hands, which he
was informed had been left by a gentleman from
Washington, who would call on him in the course
of the day. He eagerly tore open the envelope,
and in the superscriptions of four letters,
recognized
the hands of Amelia, Ellen, Morse, and his
aunt; but had scarcely broken the seal of the
first, when his cousin Aylwin seized him by the
hand.
The pleasure of this meeting was lively and
reciprocal. George had a thousand fond
inquiries
to make, and he proposed them with such
rapidity
that Aylwin found it difficult to answer one
in ten. At length, seizing the advantage of a
momentary pause, he exclaimed:
To answer all your questions at once, your
friends in Boston are all well in health, sound in
intellect, and successful in business. For the
state of their hearts, I refer you to their epistles.
I arrived in Washington on Wednesday last, and
should have been here yesterday, but for the
carelessness
of a stage-driver, who upset the carriage
and broke an axle-tree.
But what brought you to the seat of
government
?
The invitation of captain Hull. I have
applied
to the department for a sailing-master's
war-rant
,
which will probably be ready for me on my
return. I shall then join the Constitution at
Annapolis.
A fine frigate and a noble commander,
exclaimed
George; may you load her with
laurels.
Amen, responded Aylwin, let me but
have the opportunity and receive the orders to
lay her alongside of the heaviest frigate in the
British navy
hull to hull
then for the `
unprofitable
contest of trying which can do the other
the most harm.' What is the name of the
English
frigate in the roads?
The Macedonian, captain Carden; and that
with the American flag is the United States,
commanded
by Decatur. Which would you bet on
in case of a contest?
On the Macedonian, answered Aylwin,
provided
she was navigated by American seamen.
As it is, on the United States. Heaven grant
they may come as near to each other after war
18
is declared as they are nowI wish it for the
honor of the American flag.
And captain Carden wishes it for the honor of
the British flag, said George; he is confident
that with his frigate he could take Decatur's.
Has he ever expressed such a confidence?
He has, replied George; I had the honor of
dining at the British consul's last week, at whose
table Decatur and Carden were both present,
besides
a number of gentlemen of the army and
navy, when the conversation turned on the
comparative
force of those two ships, their armament,
and the number as well as excellence of their
crews. Captain Carden then stated, that a
British
thirty-eight gun frigate was fully ascertained,
by experience, to be the most efficient
single-decked
vessel that ever swam the ocean; that
any increase of size was worse than useless, as it
only rendered them more unmanageable, and
concluded
by saying, that from experience he felt
satisfied he could take the United States with the
Macedonian.
What arrogant presumption!
He palliated it, continued George, by
adding
,
that he disclaimed any intention to question
the skill or bravery of the American officers or
seamen.
Why, they once termed our frigates
seventy-fours
in disguise
, observed Aylwin.
Yes, and they have also called them `
cock-boats
with a piece of striped bunting at the
masthead
.'
But whatever they may think of our
little
navy, an opportunity will soon offer for testing
their opinion.
I hope so, exclaimed Aylwin. But read
your letters, for I must leave you for a short time,
being charged with dispatches for several of the
`sons of the deep,' which cannot be delivered
too soon.
I shall expect you at dinner.
You had better not, replied Aylwin, for I
shall board the United States, and there is too
much hospitality among us sailors to suffer a
comrade to depart empty. Adieu till evening.
But do you bring no news from
Washington
?
inquired George. How stands the
political
thermometer?
Up to seventy-six, which I take to be
blood
heat. The war-fever has not abated,
notwithstanding
all the cooling prescriptions of certain
political quacks.
But does the disorder assume any new
symptoms
,
of a less equivocal complexion?
Yes, both new and unequivocal, replied
Aylwin. The governor of Michigan territory is
now at Washington, and daily closeted with the
secretary of war. It is whispered that they are
laying their heads together to plan a campaign
against Upper Canada.
Do you believe these whispers, Aylwin, or
are you merely jesting?
So far am I from jesting on this subject, that
one object of my journey to Norfolk is to give
you timely notice, in order that you may petition
for a transfer, and join the little army Hull is
about raising; for I know that you would wish to
be actively engaged in the earliest operations
against our enemythat is to be.
I owe you a thousand thanks, my dear
cousin
,
replied George; and I will instantly
forward
an application to the war department. The
friendship which Eustis has ever professed for
my father may induce him to serve his son.
I have no doubt of it. But, once more and
for the last time, adieu till evening.
For about a fortnight, the society of his cousin
added much to the felicity of George, and proved
a valuable acquisition to the little circle of his
particular friends. But the pleasure resulting
from such intercourse was limited to that period,
for on the twenty-first day of April, Aylwin was
summoned to Washington, obtained his warrant
on the twenty-fourth, and immediately joined his
frigate; and on the tenth of May George received
orders which removed him far from those friends
who had chosen a path to glory on the stormy
main.
CHAPTER XXIV.
CATHARINE AT HOME.
What a rich feast the canker grief has made!
How has it suck'd the roses of thy cheeks,
And drank the liquid crystal of thine eyes!
Sewel's Sir Walt. Rawl
.
When
major Willoughby arrived at
Mulberry-Grove
,
after obtaining a commission for his son
at Washington, as recorded in the twenty-second
chapter of this history, he lost no time in visiting
his neighbor Fleming, who had arrived with his
daughter only five days before him. An
explanation
immediately took place respecting every
circumstance attending the catastrophe at
Richmond
,
to the mutual astonishment of all parties.
When Catharine learned that she did not owe
her life to Sandford, but that she had been actually
saved by the intrepidity of George, supported in
his arms, and pressed to his bosom, her sensations
overpowered her, and she fainted. She soon
revived
,
however, and a few moments retreat to
another
apartment, supported by her mother,
restored
her recollection. Gratitude to her pretended
preserver had hitherto sealed her lips respecting
his villanous propositions; with her burning face
hid in her mother's bosom, she now for the first time
imparted the humiliating secret. Indignation for
the affront, horror for the danger her daughter
had incurred, and joy for her happy escape,
almost
reduced the mother to the state from which
Catharine had just been recovered. It was
imparted
to Fleming and Willoughbythe one
stamped with ragethe other returned thanks to
Heaven for her deliverance.
The general behaviour and particular anxiety
of George at Richmond, had for the first time
imparted
to the mind of his father an idea which
the reader has for some time entertained. But
the major was unwilling to adopt it; for it was in
direct opposition to his favorite doctrine, that
absence is the death of infant love. It is true
he admitted, what he knew from his own
experience
,
that the seeds of a tender and lasting
affection
may be sown in childhood; but he believed
that the seeds of vegetables could as easily spring
up and grow without the presence of the sun, as
those of love without the presence of its object.
George and Catharine were scarcely past
childhood
when their separation took place. That
separation had lasted almost two years, and was
it possible, that her unfinished portrait had
remained
in his bosom unfaded? Or had
imagination
,
during that period, been playing the artist,
and brightening the delicate tints of infancy to the
18*
full lustre of youthful beauty? At any rate, was
it not evident, from present appearances, that
George would never have occasion to sink under
the preying despondency of a hopeless passion,
if Catharine Fleming was its object?
Such were the questions which arose in the
mind of Willoughby as he walked back to the
Grove, and although the responses of his heart
were not in exact unison with the pre-conceived
opinions of his head, yet, he determined to act, in
one respect, as if the former were correct. He
was ignorant of Sandford's former connexion with
George, but thought it more than probable that the
duties of their profession might one day bring them
together. Were George to be made acquainted
with the foregoing circumstances, unpleasant, if
not fatal consequences might be produced. It was
true that the mind of his son was strongly guarded
against the suggestions of false honor; still, if he
did really love Catharine, reason and religion
might possibly (on the impulse of the moment) be
both forgotten, and some disastrous event spread
a circle of misery over the placid surface of their
present destiny. He therefore merely informed
George, by letter, that Fleming and his daughter
had arrived home in safety, that Catharine was
very grateful to George for his gallantry in
saving
her life at Richmond, and that the whole
family
longed for an opportunity to thank him in
person.
Catharine did indeed long for such an
opportunity
.
For the first time she ventured to examine
the real state of her heart, and ended with the
conviction that she could bear, with comparative
composure, any misfortune except the loss of that
affection which she now more than ever believed
was cherished for her in the bosom of George.
His image, in the attitude of bidding her a silent
adieu, had been ever present to her imagination,
since their parting interview. The handkerchief
with which he hastily arrested one truant drop
that glittered on his cheek, was moist with her
own tears. He had turned to look adieu, for
he felt it impossible to articulate the word.
Such was the picture on which her fancy had
dwelt with growing fondness. It was that of a
blooming boy; and she had almost regretted that
his advance towards maturity would necessarily
displace those softer graces by more manly
endowments
:
she had felt that the slightest
alteration
in a single feature, would be a blemish in the
lovely portrait, and mar, if not totally destroy,
its identity. She loved the boyshe had never
seen the man.
But since the late eclaircissment the picture
had been changed. A hero was now
represented
bearing her almost lifeless form from a scene
of horror and destruction, at the imminent hazard
of his own life. From motives truly
disinterested
and magnanimous, he had struggled with a
devouring
element, disdaining to shrink from
personal
danger while the life of a fellow-creature
depended upon his courage and exertions. In
vain a thousand tongues of fire demand his
rescued
victimin vain the forked flames pursue
him for their prey; he dashes undaunted through
the sulphurous cloud, and bears his prize in
triumph
from the funeral pyre of Richmond's
brightest
hopes. To reward the perilous achievement,
Heaven had directed his aid to one whose
existence
was dear to himto one whose death would
have inflicted a lasting wound in his bosom. His
subsequent anxiety for an interview had been
represented
to her, and she now thought that life
would be insupportable if a meeting with her
preserver
was much longer deferred.
Many tardy weeks lingered as they passed,
vivacity
fled, health gradually declined, and the
once blooming lively Catharine was but the
pallid
spectre of her former self. She sometimes
resorted
to the harp for relief, but her performances
were too much in unison with the tone of her
feelings
,
to impart cheerfulness to her mind; the
Parting of Friends

or
some other air of a similar character, would rise
unbidden from the sympathetic strings.
She touch'd the chords of joy, but low
And mournful answer'd notes of wo.
Scott's Lady of the Lake.
One circumstance that contributed not a little
to the melancholy of Catharine, was the illness
of her dear grandfather. During the long
absence
of his favorite, the poor old man had
fretted
himself incessantly; and the sudden impulse
of joy with which he embraced her on her return,
added to his terrors for the danger she had
incurred
,
proved too powerful for his debilitated
system
;
a raging fever, attended with frequent fits
of delirium, now kept him confined to his bed.
Catharine was his nurse, for in his lucid intervals
he would receive assistance from no other hand;
she watched continually by his pillow, except
when her mother exhorted her with tears to regard
her own declining health, and compelled her, at
times, to relinquish the office to her parents.
The tender assiduities of this affectionate
family
,
with the excellent prescriptions of a skilful
physician, were not entirely lost on O'Hara. His
fever was broken, his mental faculties composed,
and his strength so far restored, that in the course
of a month he could walk across his chamber,
supported by the arm of his attentive
grand-daughter
,
and occasionally recreate himself on his harp.
Catharine undoubtedly possessed the first place
in the affections of O'Hara; but next to her he
loved George Willoughby, his amiable and
tractable
pupil. The old man would speak of him in
terms of approbation amounting to enthusiasm,
and delighted to hear others mention his name.
Catharine, who considered no task a hardship that
could impart a ray of comfort to the afflicted
heart of her poor sick grandfather, was never
backward in discussing his favourite theme, the
merits of
master
Willoughby. His heroic
achievement
on the lake when not ten years old, his
accomplished
manners, his generous disposition,
his daring intrepidity, his acquirements in
literature
,
his genius in poetry, and his skill in music,
were subjects which never wearied the ear of
O'Hara, nor fatigued the tongue of Catharine.
She would lull him to repose with some song that
George had written, and administered his
nourishment
in a cup which George had formed of a
curious
shell. The old man fretted continually at
the long absence of his pupiland so, perhaps,
did Catharine.
One circumstance, which occurred two years
before, had tended not a little to endear the pupil
to his tutor. On the seventeenth of March, the
festival of Erin's tutelar saint, George requested
O'Hara to perform some national air, appropriate
to the occasion. The old harper refused, urging
as a reason, the present degraded condition of his
native country, and broke out into a torrent of
invectives
against the tyranny which held it in
vassalage
.
Two days afterwards, at the conclusion
of his musical exercises, George sung the
following
words to one of his tutor's favorite airs.
From that time forward, no power on earth could
have convinced O'Hara that his pupil was not a
prodigy.
THE EXILED MINSTREL.
Friendless
exile! old and hoary,
Banish sorrow and complaint,
Wake thy harp to Erin's glory,
Sing the lay of Erin's saint.
'Twas Saint Patrick's festal morning,
When I met the man of grief;
On his cheek the tear was burning
Wither'd was the shamrock leaf.
No, exclaim'd the aged stranger,
Erin's glory is no more;
Hordes of bloody tyrants range her,
Freedom flies Hibernia's shore.
Shackled with the yoke of Britain,
Doom'd to vassalage and chains,
Be her name nor sung nor written,
Till oppression fly her plains.
Bright she shines in ancient legends,
When her sons awoke the lay,
Ere her peaceful verdant regions
Groan'd beneath Ambition's sway.
Ask me not to sing of glory,
For, by all the griefs I bear,
By these scatter'd locks so hoary,
By our holy saint, I swear:
Erin's harp shall ever slumber,
Never whisper through the vale,
Never breathe a tuneful number
Pregnant with dishonor's tale.
Fallen are the chiefs of Erin,
Fallen in their country's cause;
Green their tombs are now appearing,
There her weeping daughters pause.
When the night-blast scours the mountains,
When it murmurs through the groves,
Mournful by the dusky fountains,
Emmett's shade in sadness moves.
See! it points to curst oppression!
Hark! it's shrieks arrest the gale!
Hurl your thunders on aggression,
Bid our warriors fill the vale.
Veterans, rouse! and save your nation!
Hark! the trumpet calls to arms!
Stranger! calm this perturbation,
Here no martial trump alarms.
In his eye, where fire was beaming,
Now appear'd the tear of grief;
No, he sigh'd, I was but dreaming,
Erin groans without relief.
But I'll feed the fond reflection,
Days of other months review,
Call again to recollection
Dear companions whom I knew.
Now opprest by power and vi'lence,
Not a harp-string breathes a tone;
Wrapt in sorrow, thought, and silence,
Erin's hapless minstrels moan.
Sing of Erin's glory? madness!
Would our Saint accept the lay?
Nodevote to silent sadness
This our patron's festive day.
As the spring advanced, O'Hara's health
continued
to improve; and on the morning of the
eleventh day of May, he accompanied his
son-in-law
in a pleasant ramble of nearly half a mile,
during which he felt himself considerably revived
by the refreshing breeze which fanned him from
the lake.
As they were returning, a man in a sailor's
dress accosted Fleming, and requested some
trifling
assistance, to enable him to pursue his
journey
to the westward, he having walked all the
way from Philadelphia, and expended the little
money with which he set out. Fleming
immediately
conducted him to his house, and ordered
breakfast to be prepared for the weary traveller.
During his repast, the son of Neptune became
communicative, and informed his hospitable
entertainers
that his name was Collins, and that he
had for several years sailed in the merchant
service
from the port of Boston, which was his
native
place; but was afterwards impressed on
board a British ship of war in the West-Indies,
and for six years compelled to serve in his
majesty's
navy on different stations; and that he
was finally transferred to the Macedonian, from
which he effected his escape at Norfolk, by
swimming
from the frigate in the night. Three of his
shipmates, equally anxious to breathe the
invigorating
air of liberty, were partners in this
perilous
attempt to escape from an unjust bondage
one of them only reached the shore with Collins.
From Norfolk he had worked his passage, in a
small coasting vessel, to Philadelphia, where he
fortunately met a gentleman with whom he had
been acquainted in Boston, who informed him
that his parents were dead, and that his brother
had purchased a farm in some part of Geauga
county, in the state of Ohio, on which he now
resided
.
This gentleman furnished him with a
small sum of money, with which he commenced
his journey in search of his brother.
Fleming observed that his escape must have
been a very hazardous undertaking.
It was so, replied the sailor; but we were
willing to risk our lives for liberty. It was a great
distance to swim in a dark night, and our poor
shipmates must have sunk through fatigue. When
we mustered on the shore, there was but two of
us.
Were your unfortunate shipmates both
Americans
?
No, sir; but we had all been prest, and
freedom
is as sweet to an Englishman as to an
American
.
There are now eight American sailors on
board the Macedonian, who had agreed to come
off with us, but their hearts failed them. Jack
Card, Will Thompson, and Jack Wallis, backed
out after they had got down the hawser. Tom
Nowell, whom I left in Norfolk, was an
Englishman
;
and one of the poor fellows that was
drowned
was an American, the other an Irishman, who
had been prest in Belfast twelve years ago. I
loved him like a brotherbut `grieving's a
folly
,'
as the song says. Poor Will and I have had
many a hard pull together.
Belfast!twelve years ago! exclaimed
Mrs. Fleming; his name?
O'Hara.
O my poor brother William!
The old harper uttered a dreadful groan, and
fell lifeless on the floor.
19
The scene which followed was distressing. The
females were distracted, Fleming bewildered, and
the sailor astonished. O'Hara was the first object
of attention; and Fleming, assisted by the sailor,
raised him from the floor, and placed him on a
bed; but he exhibited no tokens of life or
sensation
.
The condition of Mrs. Fleming was little
better; Help my dear father! O my poor
brother! were the only expressions to which she
could give utterance. The attention of
Catharine
was divided between her mother and
grand-father
,
but the agitation of her spirits was so great
that she afforded little assistance to either. The
sailor did what he could, and lavished a thousand
imprecations on his limbs and eyes for being the
instrument of so much distress and confusion.
But vain were all their attentions to the old
harperthe sudden shock had been too violent
for his feeble framehis spirit had fled to a
better
world.
CHAPTER XXV.
THE MEETING.
The joys of meeting pay the pangs of absence,
Else who could bear it?
Rowe's Tam
.
A month
had clapsed since the interment of
O'Hara, and the family had in some measure
recovered
their cheerfulness, when an incident
occurred
by which their tranquility was again
interrupted
.
It was Sunday, and they were, as usual,
attending religious worship in the village of
Cleveland, when about the middle of the service,
every eye, (except a few more properly
employed
)
was attracted by the entrance of two
military
officers in full dress, to whom several pew doors
were thrown open, as they advanced up the
principal
aisle of the church. Although they entered
one adjoining that of Fleming, Catharine neither
saw nor heard them. Her external eyes were
closed, and those of her mind lifted with humble
reverence to her Heavenly Parent. Mentally
accompanying
the clergyman in his address to the
throne of mercy, she poured out her pure soul in
grateful thanksgiving for her creation,
preservation
,
and all the blessings she enjoyed. A
regiment
at that moment might have marched into the
church unperceived by Catharine.
On resuming her seat, however, an unusual
severity
in her father's aspect caught her attention.
Her eye anxiously followed his indignant gaze,
and lighted on the image ofSandford!
I will not pretend that Catharine's devotion,
pure and sincere as it was, had effectually
guarded
her mind against the effects of surprise; that
is more than we have a right to expect from the
weakness of humanity. The color forsook her
cheek, and she clung to her mother for support.
Alarmed at her daughter's indisposition, Mrs.
Fleming led her from the pew, but had scarcely
gained the aisle, when she fainted in her arms.
Fleming flew to her assistance, and so did
several
females of her acquaintance. Permit me,
sir, said Sandford, offering his aid, and starting
with unaffected surprise on discovering whom he
was addressingwhom he was supporting.
The whole party left the church, followed by
the other officer; when the transition to the open
air immediately revived the lovely object of their
solicitude; who, shuddering with terror, shrunk
from the support of Sandford, and canght her
father's arm.
Nay, my dear, do not be
ungrateful
thank
that
gentleman
for his
gallantry
have you
forgotten
your
generous preserver?
This was
uttered
by Fleming, in a tone of the most cutting
irony. He then turned to the confused object of
his sarcasm, and continuedIt really seems,
captain Sandford
, that you are sent by Heaven to
protect
my daughter on every
critical emergency
.
Do me, sir, the
honor
to favour me with your
address
,
that I may call on you to-morrow, and
thank
you as I ought
.
Sandford was thunderstruck at this address;
for the tone and manner of the speaker
convinced
him that some explanation had taken place not
much to his advantage. He secretly wished
himself
a thousand miles offor rather, he wished all
the rest of the party at that distance, with the
exception
of Catharine. He was completely taken
by surprise, and knew not what to say, or how to
act; but at length stammered out something about
a vessel that was on the point of sailing for
Buffalo
,
in which he and his friend had engaged a
passage, and awkwardly expressed his regret that
his time was too limited to wait on Mr. Fleming.
Then making a hasty bow, he seized the other
officer by the arm, and hurried him out of sight,
while Catharine was conducted by her parents to
the house of an acquaintance, with whom they
had promised to dine.
The delicacy of Catharine's frame could not
immediately surmount the shock it had received;
she continued agitated and dejected during the
intermission, and when the afternoon service was
about to commence, expressed a desire to return
home. Fleming, who readily assented to her
wish, ordered the waggon to be brought up, and
handed in the females, but declined accompanying
them, as he preferred walking that distance in the
cool hour of twilight, and wished also to attend
the afternoon meeting.
During the ride, both mother and daughter
were silent and thoughtful; but very different
were the subjects of their meditation. Catharine
was reflecting on the similar effects of opposite
causes. The sudden appearance of George
instead
of Sandford, would doubtless have
imparted
an agitation to her frame, equal to that which
had lately overpowered it; but how different
would have been her present sensations! Joy
rapture would have filled that bosom which was
now laboring with sighs of sadness and regret.
Mrs. Fleming had marked the indignant scorn
of her husband's deportment towards Sandford,
his subsequent thoughtfulness, and final
determination
to tarry at Cleveland the remainder of the
day. These circumstances gave rise to many
doubts and questions in her mind. He had never
been remarkably exact in the performance of
devotional
exercises; why then did he, on the
present
occasion, express so particular a desire to
attend to those duties? Might it not be his
intention
to seek another interview with Sandford? If
soshe trembled for the consequences.
This train of thinking was continued, until
busy fancy had conjured up a thousand distressing
fears for the safety of her husband. The more
she reflected, the more plausible appeared the
grounds on which her terrors were erected; until
19*
her feelings became so powerfully affected, that
she determined to end the dreadful suspense by
returning immediately to Cleveland.
Their habitation was now in full view, and
separated
from them only by a beautiful meadow,
around which winded the carriage road, long and
circuitous. Here Mrs. Fleming, assuming a
composure
to which her bosom was a stranger, first
mentioned her intention of returning to the
village
.
It will be a long walk for your father,
said she to Catharine, and I feel an inclination
to repeat the ride. If you have no wish to
accompany
me, (and I would rather recommend
repose
)
you may alight here, and walk to the
house. The path is pleasant, and the cool shade
will refresh you. If you find yourself
sufficiently
composed, assist Susan in preparing tea against
our return.
Catharine alighted, and entered the meadow,
while her mother ordered Thomas to drive back
to Cleveland with as much expedition as possible.
They arrived at the church door just as the
congregation
was dismissed; and Mrs. Fleming
watched with trembling anxiety as they came out,
but her husband met not her view.
She now repaired to the house of her friend,
who was not a little surprised at her unexpected
return; but informed her that Fleming had
accompanied
her husband to church, and that she
expected them back every moment.
The fears of Mrs. Fleming were not entirely
destitute of foundation. Her husband had been
in search of Sandford, accompanied by his friend,
and his determination was, to make a public
exposure
of his baseness, and then act as
circumstances
might dictate. Had they met,
consequences
of a serious nature might have been
produced
;
for the least insolence on the part of
Sandford would have insured that hero a sound
cudgeling; and the other officer would probably
have thought it his duty to interfere in behalf of
his friend.
But fortunately they did not meet. The packet
in which the officers had embarked for Buffalo,
sailed while Fleming was at dinner, and was
nearly
out of sight, when he finally ascertained that
she contained the object of his pursuit. He
therefore
continued to stroll along the beach with his
friend, until the declining sun warned them to
return
when
tranquility was again restored to the
almost distracted bosom of his affectionate
consort
.
In the mean time, Catharine found her little
walk so agreeable, that she felt in no haste to
terminate
it. A row of sugar-maples on the margin
of a pure rivulet, effectually screened her from
the rays of the sun; birds were singing in the
branches, and a thousand wild flowers scattered
in her path. The refreshing breeze, at intervals,
gently breathed upon her cheek, and wantoned
with a profusion of ringlets, that hung below her
black straw hat. But though the placid smile of
nature had lulled into quiet the recent
perturbation
of her spirits, her reflections still flowed in a
melancholy course, and were not inaptly
represented
by the sable habiliments of her person.
She recalled to her recollection the time when
that meadow was a thick grove, in which she had
often strayed with George, and listened with
delight
to the music of his voice, or the fascinating
tones of his harp. She recollected the particulars
of their first interview, and his application to be
come the pupil of her grandfather; his eagerness
to receive his old tutor's instructions, and his
patient
assiduity in learning those airs which she
had intimated were her particular favorites.
His poor blind tutor was dead! Her dear
grand-father
,
who loved her so tenderly, and for whom
she felt all the affection of a daughter, would
never
more press her to his fond bosom, or receive
pleasure from her dutiful attentions! His harp
was forever silent, for the hand of its master was
mouldering in the dust!
Her feelings became enthusiastic, and she
exclaimed
aloudSainted spirit of my dear
grand-father
!
if it be possible for angels to remember
those on earth who were once the objects of their
love, look down in pity on your poor Catharine,
and whisper peace to her disconsolate bosom!
A soft strain of musicmore sweetmore
seraphic
than any that had ever met her ear, at that
moment floated along on the delighted breeze.
Soft as the slumbering infant's sigh,
Sweet as the tear in Pity's eye.
[15]
[15]
Montgomery's Pillow.
Those silver sounds, so soft, so dear,
The listener held her breath to hear.
Scott's Lady of the Lake
She was near the house, and the sounds
evidently
proceeded from thence. But what hand
could produce them? She almost believed that
the spirit of her grandfather was permitted in this
manner to answer her ejaculation. She
trembled
,
but not with terror; her sensations were
undefinable.
The music ceased, and Catharine timidly
advanced
;
when through an open window a
military
uniform met her view, and the idea of
Sandford
shot like a bolt of ice through her trembling
heart. While she was hesitating how to act,
whether to retreat or advance, the door opened,
and an officer darted towards her. Terror lent
her wings, and she fled, but in a few moments
found herself in the arms of George Washington
Willoughby.
Catharine! my dear Catharine! exclaimed
he, why do you fly me? Has the presence of
George become hateful to you?
She reclined her head gently on his shoulder,
and with a look of unutterable tenderness replied:
O noO no! not
you
Never would I fly from
you
. I thought it was She hesitated.
Whom, lovely creature?
I was frightened at your sudden appearance.
O George, you have been absent a great while!
If Catharine thinks it long, then my return
is blest, replied George as he led her to a seat
in a little rustic arbor covered with the
full-blossomed
bean, where after a
tete a tete
of three
hours, they doubted that as many minutes had
passed, so entirely were they occupied with
mutual
inquiries, replies, explanations, declarations,
and confessionsassurances of affection and vows
of eternal fidelity. It was not until they heard
the waggon drive up to the house, that Catharine
once recollected father, mother, Susan, or the
tea.
CHAPTER XXVI.
DECLARATION OF WAR.
How you awake the sleeping sword of War,
We charge you in the name of God, take heed!
For never two
such
nations did contend
Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops
Are every one a wo, a sore complaint,
'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the sword
That makes such waste in brief mortality.
Shakes. Henry V.
On
Monday, the first day of June, one thousand
eight hundred and twelve, a confidential message
was received, in both chambers of Congress, from
the president of the United States, which was
read with closed doors, and referred to a select
committee by the senate, and to the committee
of foreign relations by the house of
representatives
.
Without the capitol walls, but one
opinion
prevailed respecting the character of this
message
no
one believed it to be pacific, but with
respect to its influence on the members of the
august
body to whom it was addressed, many
conjectures
were afloatdifferent parties maintaining
different opinions.
In the mean time a very animated debate on
the subject was supported within doors, under an
injunction of secrecy. The message was indeed
far from pacific. It recounted, in a manly style,
the various, repeated, and continued aggressions
of Great Britain, on the rights and interests of
the United States, contrary to the known,
established
,
and acknowledged laws of nations. It
dwelt, in particular, on the subject of their
impressing
American seamen, and compelling them
to serve in the British navy, and asserted that
thousands of American citizens, under the
safeguard
of public law and of their national flag,
had been torn from their country, and from
every
thing dear to them; had been dragged on
board ships of war of a foreign nation, and
exposed
,
under the severities of their discipline, to
be exiled to the most distant and deadly climes,
to risk their lives in the battles of their
oppressors
,
and to be the melancholy instruments of
taking
away those of their fellow-citizens. This
important document next adverted to the
violation
of the rights and peace of the American
coast by British cruizers, who had been in the
practice of hovering over to harass departing
commerce, and who had wantonly spilt American
blood within the sanctuary of territorial
jurisdiction
.
Under pretended blockades, without
the pretence of an adequate force, and sometimes
without the practicability of applying one,
American
commerce had been plundered in every sea,
the great staples of the country cut off from their
legitimate markets, and a destructive blow aimed
at the agricultural and maritime interests of
American citizens. After animadverting at some
length on the injustice of the orders in council,
and the inhumanity of exciting the savages to
hostilities
,
the message concluded with
recommending
to the early deliberation of both houses, this
solemn question:
Whether the United States
should continue passive under these progressive
usurpations and accumulating wrongs; or
opposing
force to force in defence of their natural rights,
should commit a just cause into the hands of the
Almighty disposer of events?
The committee to whom this message was
submitted
in the house of representatives, made a
long report on the Wednesday following, in which
they travelled over the same ground of
aggressions
,
usurpations, &c. and ended by
recommending
an immediate appeal to arms
.
Mr. Calhoun, chairman of this committee, then
presented a bill declaring war between Great
Britain and her dependencies, and the United
States and their territories, which was warmly
opposed and obstinately debated in secret
session
,
for two days, when it passed the house by a
majority of thirty. It was then taken up in the
senate, where it underwent a very enlarged
discussion
,
and met with much opposition; but
finally
passed that body also, on the seventeenth of
June, by a majority of six.
Three different positions were assumed by
the different opposers of this bill; one class
attempting
to prove its injustice, another its inutility,
and a third its impolicy. The first of these
maintained that the aggressions of England were
not, in quality or extent, such as would justify an
appeal to arms on the part of the United States;
that the former had been compelled by imperious
and peculiar circumstances to the obnoxious
measures
which were the subject of complaint; and
that she was ever ready and willing to do the
injured
party ample justice, when those
circumstances
should cease to control her. The second
class contended that, however justifiable might be
a resort to the sword, the measure would fail in its
object, and adduced many arguments to prove
that the injuries complained of were not of such a
nature as could be redressed by war in the then
existing state of the world. A third party admitted
that the aggressions of Great Britain were such
as would justify a declaration of war against her,
and that redress was attainable by such a
measure
,
provided
her adversary was sufficiently
powerful
to persevere in her claims, and maintain the
contest with vigor. But the resources of the
United States, they contended, were too limited
for so vast an undertaking. A similar opinion is
expressed by the dauphine of France, in
Shakspeare's
play of Henry V.
I well allow the
occasion
of our arms;
But gladly would be better satisfied
How in our
means
we should advance ourselves
To look with forehead bold and big enough
Upon the
power
and
puissance
of the foe?
The bill declaring war received the signature
of the president on the eighteenth of June, and
was the next day publicly announced by the
following proclamation:
By the President of the United States of America.
A PROCLAMATION.
Whereas the Congress of the United States,
by virtue of the constituted authority vested in
them, have decided by their act, bearing date the
eighteenth day of the present month, that War
exists between the United Kingdom of Great
Britain
and Ireland, and the dependencies thereof,
and the United States of America and their
territories
:
Now therefore I, James Madison, President
of the United States of America, do hereby
proclaim
the same to all whom it may concern: and I
do especially enjoin on all persons holding offices,
civil or military, under the authority of the
United
States, that they be vigilant and zealous in
discharging
the duties respectively incident thereto:
20
And I do moreover exhort all the good people
of the United States, as they love their country;
as they value the precious heritage derived from
the virtue and valor of their fathers; as they feel
the wrongs which have forced on them the last
resort of injured nations; and as they consult
the best means, under the blessings of Divine
Providence, of abridging its calamities; that
they exert themselves in preserving order, in
promoting
concord, in maintaining the authority and
the efficacy of the laws, and in supporting and
invigorating
all the measures which may be
adopted
by the constituted authorities, for obtaining a
speedy, a just, and an honorable peace.
(L.S.) In testimony whereof, I have hereunto
set my hand, and caused the seal of the
United States to be affixed to these
presents.
Done at the City of Washington, the
nineteenth day of June, one thousand
eight hundred and twelve, and of the
Independence of the United States the
thirty-sixth.
(Signed) JAMES MADISON.
By the President.
(Signed) JAMES MONROE.
In a few days after the publication of the above
document, the members of the minority in
congress
,
united in a long and animated address to
their constituents, in which they entered their
most solemn protest against the declaration of
war. In this address they insisted, that though
the wrongs of which the United States had to
complain were, in some respects, very grievous
to their interests; and in many, humiliating to
their feelings, yet these wrongs were of a nature
which either would not justify war, or which, at
that time, war would not remedy. After using
many arguments to prove the correctness of this
position as it respected impressments, blockades,
and orders in council, the addressers concluded
by appealing more directly to those affections of
the heart, which in their operation seldom wait
for the sanction of the understanding. How
(asked they) shall a nation, like the United States,
happy in its great local relations; removed from
the bloody theatre of Europe; with a maritime
border opening vast fields for enterprise; with
territorial possessions exceeding every real want;
its firesides safe; its altars undefiled; from
invasion
nothing to fear; from acquisition nothing to
hope; how shall such a nation look to heaven for
its smiles, while throwing away, as though they
were worthless, all the blessings and joys which
peace and such a distinguished lot include? With
what prayers can it address the Most High, when
it prepares to pour forth its youthful rage upon a
neighboring people, from whose strength it has
nothing to dread, from whose devastation it has
nothing to gain?
If our ills were of a nature that war would
remedy, if war would compensate any of our
losses, or remove any of our complaints, there
might be some alleviation of the suffering in the
charm of the prospect. But how will war upon
the land protect commerce upon the ocean? What
balm has Canada for wounded honor? How are
our mariners benefited by a war which exposes
those who are free, without promising release to
those who are impressed?
But it is said that war is demanded by honor.
Is national honor a principle which thirsts after
vengeance, and is appeased only by blood, which,
trampling on the hopes of man, and spurning the
law of God, untaught by what is past, and
careless
of what is to come, precipitates itself into
any folly or madness to gratify a selfish vanity,
or to satiate some unhallowed rage? If honor
demands
a war with England, what opiate lulls that
honor to sleep over the wrongs done us by
France? &c.
To this address there were thirty-four
signatures
.
Government had long been aware that, sooner
or later, things must come to this issue, and had
accordingly made such arrangements to meet the
crisis as were within their power. It was
necessary
that a competent force should be stationed in
the Michigan Territory, for the protection of the
inhabitants against the incursions of the enemy,
or for acting offensively, should policy require
such a measure. For this purpose, the governor
of that territory had been at Washington to
consult
with the secretary of war upon that subject,
and had finally made arrangements for
conducting
a considerable force to Detroit.
The name of this gentleman was Hullwhose
military services during the revolutionary war are
well known to his countrymen. He was born at
Derby, in the state of Connecticut, and received
his education in Yale college, where he
graduated
about the time that the American colonies
first took up arms in opposition to the tyrannical
usurpations of the mother country. He then
entered
the army as a volunteer, and served as
aid-de-camp
to the commander in chief in several
eventful campaigns. He married a young lady
of family and fortune, in Massachusetts, about
the same time that major Willoughby led our
hero's mother to the altar. He had been, for
some time, governor of Michigan Territory, and
was lately appointed a brigadier-general in the
army.
General Hull held an elevated place in the
opinion of his fellow-citizens. In college he had
been famed for his classical attainments, and ever
since had ranked high as a scholar. He was
uncle
to captain Isaac Hull, of the frigate
Constitution
,
on board of which Aylwin was
sailing-master
.
Having made the necessary arrangements some
time previous to the declaration of war, and
digested
a plan of the projected campaign, the
general, with a few regular troops under his
command
,
repaired to Dayton, a small town in the
state of Ohio, situated near the mouth of Mad
river, which is a branch of the Great Miami.
Here he unfurled the standard of the
Northwestern
Army
, and was soon joined by above
twelve hundred volunteers from the adjacent
towns, and most of those brave lads who had
reaped a laurel harvest on the banks of the
Wabash
.
With this force he took up his line of
march towards Detroit, a well fortified town on
the western bank of the strait which unites Lake
St. Clair with the waters of Erieseparated
only by a small river from the British territory.

CHAPTER XXVII.
THE WHIP-HANDLE.
When injur'd Virtue would redress obtain,
Approving Justice will her cause defend;
Her foe resorts to artifice in vain,
The means he uses but defeat his
end
.
Anon.
In
consequence of George's application to the
War Department, he had received orders to
report
himself to the commanding officer at Fort
Meigs, on or before the twenty-fifth day of June,
and there join the Northwestern army in its march
to Detroit; and, having sufficient time, he
determined
to take Mulberry-Grove in his route. He
took leave of his Norfolk friends, at a convivial
party, on the twentieth day of May, and repaired
to Washington, where he tarried until the fourth
of June, when he commenced his journey for the
shores of Lake Erie.
On the evening of that day, a rumor obtained
currency, that the war bill had passed the house
of representatives, in secret session, by a large
majority. This rumor excited considerable
sensation
in Washington, and private expresses were
hurrying off in various directions. One of these
messengers stopped to change horses in
Fredericktown
,
above forty miles from the seat of
government
,
at the same inn where our hero was
waiting supper, who instantly recognised the
rider, having seen him frequently in Washington,
and knew him to be an Englishman.
As George intended to proceed nine miles
further
before he took lodgings for the night, he
invited
the stranger to bear him company, if he
was travelling the same road; but the manner in
which this invitation was declined, excited a
suspicion in the mind of George that he was
conveying
to Canada some important information
connected with the proceedings of Congress. In
answer to George's inquiries, he acknowledged
that he was travelling to Buffalo, but refused to
communicate the object of his precipitate journey.
Supper was now ready, and George invited
the messenger to partake with him. He
accepted
a few hasty mouthfuls, and a bumper of wine;
then seizing his whip, he mounted his horse, and
galloped away.
He had been gone but a few minutes, when our
hero accidentally discovered that a strange riding
whip occupied the spot on the table where he had
laid his own, and naturally concluded that the
messenger, in his haste, had inadvertently made
the exchange. But George had no reason to
lament
the incident; for while he was amusing
himself
with cutting circles in the air, a silver tip,
with which it was mounted, became unscrewed in
his hand, disclosing a cavity in the handle, which
contained a small roll of paper. He drew it
forth, and found it to be a letter addressed to his
excellency Isaac Brock, esq. governor of Upper
Canada. Considering this document as a lawful
prize captured from the enemy, George scrupled
not to deposit it in his pocket-book. He then
screwed on the tip, mounted his horse, and
proceeded
to Middleton, where he tarried until
morning
.
The landlord of the inn being a magistrate,
and a gentleman of respectable standing among
his fellow citizens, George related to him the
foregoing particulars, and requested his advice as
to the manner in which the intercepted letter
ought to be disposed of.
The present critical situation of the
country
,
replied the magistrate, and the suspicious
mode adopted for the conveyance of this letter,
will, I think, justify us in examining its contents.
If no grounds for detaining it should then appear,
I will forward it to Buffalo by mail.
As our hero could advance no reasonable
objection
to this proposition, the seal was broken,
and the following is a copy of the contents:
Washington City
,
June
4, 1812.
May it please your Excellency
,
The plot thickenswar is inevitable
and the folly or madness of democracy fully
established
.
The vassals of Bonaparte in the house
of representatives, have agreed to enlist these
States under the banners of the tyrant against
England; there can be no doubt of the senate's
concurrencewar will be declared in a few days
Detroit is the sally-portlook to Sandwich,
and expect further particulars as soon as they
transpire.
Your ever faithful friend,
X.
His Excellency Isaac Brock
.
After some consultation on the subject, it was
agreed that the magistrate, (who was to visit the
seat of government in a few days) should take
charge of this singular document, and deposit it
in the War Office, for the inspection of the
curious
,
where the writing might be recognised, and
the traitorous author detected.
Our hero, having first taken a copy of it,
committed
the original to the care of his landlord,
and proceeded on his journey.
His impatience to reach Mulberry-Grove
allowed
him no time to enjoy the beauties of the
country through which he passed. He dined at
Hager's Town, and slept at Messersburg, in
Franklin county, Pennsylvania. The next day
at noon he crossed the Juniata, a branch of the
Susquehanna, running through a barren and
mountainous
country, and took lodgings at Bedford,
sixteen miles beyond. On the fifth day of his
journey, which was Monday, the eighth of June,
he arrived at Pittsburg; reached Meadville on
Wednesday, and entered Erie on Thursday
evening
.
Here he exchanged his jaded steed for a
fresh one; and after taking some refreshment,
again pushed forward. For several miles the
road was a beautiful turnpike, the evening
cloudless
,
and the air freighted with sweets. At half
past nine o'clock, the rising moon began to tip the
landscapes with silver, and the joyous hum of a
thousand little beings greeted her appearance.
George now began to recognise sounds which
had once been familiar to his ear. The scream
of the owl, and the complaint of the
whip-poorwill
,
were welcomed as the tones of friendship,
for they reminded him of times past, and
scenes most dear to his recollection. A pleasing
train of images, led on by Memory, and
decorated
by Fancy with unreal attractions, passed in
review
before him. The queen of the groupe was
Catharine. His own blood mounted, while that
of his smoking steed dyed the rowel of his spurs.
The impatience of his soul chided the dull
motion
of matterhe wished for the velocity of
thought.
At ten o'clock the next morning he crossed the
Ashtabula, and took breakfast at a farm-house on
the river bank. Here both horse and rider
enjoyed
a few hours of needful rest, and towards
evening
resumed their journey with invigorated spirits,
The road now lay along the sandy margin of lake
Erie; a natural turnpike, on which our hero's
horse evinced the
liveliest
gratitude for the repose
which his master had granted him. A little
before
midnight, they turned off through a
clearing
to a plantation, where George concluded to
remain
until morning. Though roused from their
rest at this unseasonable hour, the farmer and his
wife received the weary traveller with great
cheerfulness, and entertained him with the best
their house afforded. It was some time before
he could convince them that he had been their
guest beforethey could trace no resemblance
between the elegant soldier and the farmer's
boy, although they recollected that the family of
major Willoughby had stopped there for
refreshment
two years before.
Early on Saturday morning he resumed his
journey, and entered the village of Cleveland in
the evening, about an hour after Sandford and his
friend had arrived, who had travelled from
Pittsburg
by the way of Beaver, Canton, and
Springfield
,
a much shorter route than that which George
had taken. In less than an hour our hero
embraced
his father.
On the following morning he was detained
until
a late hour in exchanging salutations with
several
of his old friends, who had heard of his
arrival
,
and hastened to pay him their respects. At
length, however, he stole out, and after dropping
a tear of affection on the graves of his aunt and
tutor, flew to the habitation of Catharine. The
house was deserted, for Susan had taken that
opportunity
to visit a female friend in the
neighborhood
.
He found his harp, however, and amused
himself with playing, until he discovered
Catharine
approaching across the meadow.
CHAPTER XXVIII.
LOVE AND PATRIOTISM.
Love rais'd his noble thoughts to brave achievements;
For love's the steel that strikes upon the flint,
Gives coldness heat, exerts the hidden flame,
And spreads the sparkles round to warm the world.
Dryden
.
A short
and happy week flitted rapidly away,
and the day of separation again arrived. A
fearful
day to Catharine; for she felt that her
newly-acquired
felicity would depart with the source
from which it emanated; and a void, still more
dreadful than the former, be left in her bosom.
It was the twenty-first of Junethe day on which
George was to bid adieu to Mulberry-Grove, and
all the peaceful scenes around it.
Their parting interview cannot be described,
for no eye but Heaven's was permitted to witness
it. Those bosoms which have never experienced
the thrilling transports of reciprocal love, will
feel no regret that I pass over the affecting scene
in silence; while genuine lovers will duly
appreciate
that delicacy which forbids my intruding
on its sanctity.
In the awful hour of death, all disguise is
discarded
,
and the real character of the man
appears
;
Hypocrisy, alarmed, throws off her mask,
and the heart resumes its long interrupted
intercourse
with the tongue and features. The effect
of parting is similar, when two fond lovers are
about separating for an indefinite time. Reserve
is banished, the heart will be heard, and Virtue
forgets to blush. One such parting interview is
worth a month of wooing, for it will induce a
tender
confession, when nothing else can effect it;
it removes all doubts, and displays the progress
of affection in characters too legible to be
misunderstood
Hail, Separation! then, since it imparts
Such rapturous confidence to doubting hearts;
Delightful Parting! pledge of future bliss,
To thee I owe the long-protracted
yes
,
The unrestrain'd embrace, and voluntary kiss.
Major Willoughby accompanied his son as far
as New-Salem, forty miles on his journey, where
they found their old friend the missionary, their
former fellow-traveller to Erie. He entertained
them one night at his house, and showed them
many curious Indian antiquities, which he had
collected in his various peregrinations. The next
morning our young soldier received his father's
blessing, accompanied with much excellent
advice
,
and a purse of fifty eagles, bequeathed him
by his aunt. George drew his sword, and
exclaimed
,
Whatever be the fate of
George
Washington
Willoughby
, neither the weapon he wears,
nor the name you have given him, shall ever be
tarnished by his conduct; he swears to prove
himself worthy of both, or perish.
So saying, he kissed the motto, and returned
the blade to its scabbard; then embraced his
father
,
shook hands with the missionary, and
mounting his horse, hastened forward to join his
brave countrymen in arms. He slept the next
night at Sandusky, and in the afternoon following
beheld the American standard waving on the
walls of Fort Meigs; and within those walls he
shortly after reposed.
For several days our hero amused himself in
exploring the surrounding country, and
particularly
the interesting theatre of Wayne's victory
over the Indians. It would be difficult to portray
his sensations on surveying the ground where his
father's hand had mingled with its kindred dust,
and where his own birth had been so
mysteriously
announced. Lost in thought, he remained for
some time leaning against a tree, with his eyes
fixed on the ground.
From this reverie he was at length aroused by
approaching footsteps; and on raising his eyes,
the
Mysterious Chief
stood before him. His
dress was like that which the friar's mantle
covered
at the masquerade; but the majesty of his
deportment, and the dignified expression of his
countenance, had given place to an air of
dejection
and melancholya shade of sorrow was
visible
on his brow. After a moment's silence, our
astonished hero addressed him
You see, mysterious being! that I have at
length obeyed your summons. I am now in my
country's service. May I hope for your
approbation
?
You have it, replied the chief; but
without
me, your services will be vain.
Will you then accompany me?
I am always with youfor our souls are
congenial
;
I shall always continue to be with you,
unless you prohibit my approach by suffering
your mind to descend from the orbit in which it
now revolves, and in which I move. I am ever
present with all who travel in the same circle; but
with those in larger or smaller ones, I can hold
no intercourse. Mars and Saturn can never
revolve
in the same orbittheir paths must ever
remain
distinct.
21
I do not understand you, answered George,
your language, like yourself, is all a mystery.
It is a mystery which you will one day
clearly
comprehend, returned the chief. But the
invaders of Canada approachyou must join
their standard; and whatever be the result of the
expedition,
do your duty
, and leave the rest to
Heaven. I will never desert you while you
deserve
my assistance. I have no access to your
leader, or this campaign should end in glory.
Why not to him, as easy as to me? asked
George.
When human philosophy can clearly explain
the laws of attraction and repulsion, I will
answer
your question, replied the chief. But I
shall not fail to assist and animate every one to
whom I can approach. If such gain nothing else,
they shall gain the approbation of their country.
But to the object of my visit: While your
country
claims your services, she alone must possess
your heartto her your undivided affections must
be devoted. Beware, then, how you suffer a
rival
to engross them. Patriotism must rise
superior
to all selfish considerations. When the
Champions of Freedom have secured her temple
from profanation, and when the dove shall again
nestle with the eaglethen, and not till then, you
may with honor yield to the gentle sway of
virtuous
love. But if you suffer any object to stand
between you and duty, mark me
such object
shall be removed
. Your country claims you, and
she must have you undividedentire. Continue
to deserve my friendship, by cherishing my
counsels
in your heart, and this high honor shall be
your rich reward
your single arm shall defeat
a host!
Remember me!
On saying this, he walked deliberately away;
and before George could frame a reply, or
determine
to follow him, he had turned a jutting
eminence
,
and disappeared. In a moment George
scaled the rocky summit, but could nowhere
discover
the object of his search; and stood for
some minutes a motionless statue of wonder.
The notes of a distant bugle, floating on the
southern breeze, awoke him from his trance, and
in a short time he could distinctly discern the
waving banner and nodding plumes of an
advancing
host. He precipitately descended the
eminence
,
and mounting his horse, soon met the
van-guard
of the Northwestern army.
CHAPTER XXIX.
OPENING OF THE CAMPAIGN.
Now impious arms from every part resound:
The peaceful peasant to the war is press'd;
The fields lie fallow in inglorious rest.
The plain no pasture to the flock affords;
The crooked scythes are straighten'd into swords.
Perfidious Mars long-plighted leagues divides,
And o'er the wasted world in triumph rides.
Dryd. Virg.
The
march of the army having been much
retarded
by the sick; and the greatest expedition
being necessary to reach Detroit before the news
of war should have subjected it to a siege, the
general determined to embark all the invalids,
baggage, and other incumbrances, and dispatch
them by water, while he hastened on the army by
land, a distance of about seventy miles. He
accordingly
chartered a boat and a schooner, which
were brought up the river from the lake, and
received
their destined passengers and freight.
These were ordered to sail in company, and
departed
from the Miami Rapids on Wednesday,
the first day of July. In the night, however,
they parted company, and at about ten o'clock
the next day, as the schooner was passing Fort
Malden, she was captured by the enemy, who
had received a copy of the declaration of war,
by express from Washington, a few days before.
The boat was more fortunate; she passed the
fort on Thursday evening by a different channel,
and the next day arrived in safety at Detroit. By
this unfortunate event, the army were deprived of
all their hospital stores and much valuable public
property, clothing, and baggage; while the
commander
in chief lost his instructions from the War
Department, a plan of the projected campaign,
and his commission; all of which fell into the
hands of the captors, besides thirty prisoners,
among whom were three ladies. The next day,
however, two of the ladies were politely sent
across to Detroit in a flag-boat, the other
preferring
to share the captivity of her husband.
In the mean time, the army continued its march,
and on Sunday evening encamped within three
miles of Detroit. The citizens were very
anxious
for its arrival, the news of war having
reached
them several days before, and excited the
greatest alarm for the safety of the place, there
being only about one hundred regular troops to
defend it in case of an attack. The hostile
Indians
were assembled in great numbers at Malden,
where the sanguinary Tecumseh was impatiently
waiting the signal to embrue his hatchet in
American
blood. Every moment increased the
anxiety
and alarm at Detroit, and every man capable
of bearing arms was kept constantly on duty from
Thursday until Sunday evening, (when the
advancing
army encamped in their vicinity) during
which period no man slept except on his arms.
The entrance of the army into Detroit was hailed
as the harbinger of safety, and the watch-worn
citizens once more reposed in peace and security.
Preparations were immediately commenced for
invading the enemy's territory, and with so much
ardor were they prosecuted, that on the eleventh
day of July the American standard was planted
on British soil. The army crossed from Detroit
to Sandwich, about two miles below, where they
landed without much opposition.
The general here issued a proclamation, calling
on the inhabitants to remain neutral and quiet,
and promising protection to their persons,
property
,
and rights; at the same time warning them
against taking part in the approaching contest,
on the pain of being considered and treated as
enemies.
The effect of this address on the inhabitants of
Sandwich, was a very friendly reception of the
American army, which was the same day joined
by above fifty of the Canadian militia, who
voluntarily
deserted the English standard.
On Thursday, the sixteenth, the general
ordered
colonel Cass to take a detachment of two
hundred
and eighty men, and reconnoitre the
advanced
post of the enemy, whom he found
occupying
a bridge over the river Canas, about four
miles from Malden. After examining their
position
,
Cass left one company of riflemen
concealed
near the bridge, with orders to open their fire
21*
as soon as the remainder of the detachment should
appear on the opposite side of the river, in order
to throw the enemy into confusion. The colonel
then proceeded with the remainder of his force
to a ford, five miles further up the river, where
they crossed with some difficulty, and then
commenced
their march down the southern bank.
About sunset they arrived within sight of the
enemy, who were already formed, and prepared
to meet their assailants. After the first discharge,
however, the British retreated, and were driven
about half a mile, when it became so dark, that
the victors were obliged to relinquish the pursuit.
In this little skirmish, ten of the enemy were
wounded, three killed, and two taken prisoners.
Our young ensign, who was attached to the
fourth regiment of United States Infantry, had
now, for the first time, seen hostile weapons
opposed
,
and human blood flow. The consequence
was, a perfect confidence in his own firmness and
courage; a confidence which no one can fully
possess until the extent of those qualities has
been tested by a similar trial.
All the operations of the invading army were,
for a time, successful; and all opposition seemed
to fall before it. The inhabitants seemed
satisfied
with the change of situation which appeared
to be taking place; the Canadian militia were
daily deserting to the American standard; and
the whole country under the control of the army
was claiming its protection. Had an immediate
and vigorous attack been then made on Malden,
it must have fallen an easy victory. But not a
single cannon or mortar was on wheels, to carry
before that place; and without such instruments
of assault, an attack would be impracticable, and
the attempt worse than fruitless. All
furtheroperations
of a hostile nature were therefore
suspended
,
until gun-carriages could be constructed, and
other preparations effected, for which purpose the
greatest industry was exerted.
In the mean time, an event occurred in the
western territory, which materially affected the
prospects of this little army. The important
post of Fort Michilimackinac, commanded by
lieutenant
Hanks, was attacked by the combined
British and Indians, and the garrison was
compelled
to surrender to above seven times their
number.
By this unfortunate event, the whole territory
of Michigan became suddenly opened to the
Northern Indians, who descended on that devoted
country like swarms of locusts, and joined the
British standard, in open hostility to the invading
armycontrary to their most solemn assurances
of remaining neutral.
This numerous assemblage of savages, under
the entire influence and immediate direction of
the British commander, soon enabled him, not
only to make a successful stand against the
advance
of the Americans, but also to surround them
in such a manner, as to cut off all communication
between Detroit and the United States,
obstructing
the only avenue by which the Northwestern
army could expect succors and supplies from the
country they were serving.
To re-open this communication, the
commander
detached two hundred men, under major Van
Horne, of the Ohio volunteers, with orders to
cross Detroit river, and proceed as far towards
Fort Meigs as the river Raisin, under the
expectation
that he would there meet captain Brush,
with an hundred and fifty citizens of Ohio, who
had volunteered to join the army, and were
escorting
a quantity of provisions for its use.
In obeying these orders, Van Horne's
detachment
regained the American bank of Detroit
river
,
and had proceeded southward as far as
Brownstown, when a terrible discharge of
musketry
was suddenly opened upon them from an
ambush, within fifty yards of the line. Four
captains
,
one lieutenant, two ensigns, and ten
privates
,
fell to rise no more; and a great number
of others were dangerously wounded.
Willoughby
was slightly wounded in the arm, and his
plume was shot from his hat. Notwithstanding
all the exertions of the officers, the whole
detachment
retreated in disorder, and finally returned
to camp without effecting their object.
Under this sudden and unexpected change in
his prospects, and despairing of an expected
cooperation
from the army on the Niagara river,
the general determined to suspend his operations
against Malden, and concentrate the main force
of his army at Detroit.
In pursuance of this resolution, and in
opposition
to the opinion and wishes of all the brave
spirits who had embarked in this enterprise, the
encampment was broken up in the night, and the
army returned to Detroit, leaving to the mercy of
the enemy many of the miserable Canadians who
had openly advocated the cause of their invaders.
Never had George heard an order which so
much displeased him; and he burned with an
inclination
to dispute it. Spirit of Washington!
he mentally exclaimed, as he witnessed the
striking
of the tents by torch-light; why am I
doomed
to participate in this shameful flight from an
inferior foe, and assist in this needless
degradation
of my country? Is it thus my golden
dreams of glory are to evaporate in air? Were
I but at the head of a regiment, or had the
command
of the brave Ohio volunteers, I would never
obey an order that loads us with infamy!
Remember my counsel! uttered a voice
familiar
to his ear. He started, and beheld the
Mysterious Chief
at his side, who repeated
Remember my counsel; whatever be the
result
of this expedition,
do your duty
, and leave
the rest to Heaven. A soldier's duty, remember,
is obedience. The day is approaching, when
the stains of defeat will be wiped off by the hand
of Victory. Let your conduct entitle you to
participate
in the glory of that day; for such
participation
depends on yourself alone. Continue
to deserve my friendship, by cherishing my
counsels
in your heart, and
your single arm shall yet
defeat a host!
Officers! to your postsmarch! was the
order which interrupted this interview; George
was about to reply to the singular address of the
chief, but the darkness of the evening had
shrouded him from his view; and he took his
position
in the line, which soon after began to file off
towards the river; and before morning the whole
army was encamped at Detroit, except a garrison
of two hundred and fifty infantry, and a corps of
artillerists, all under the command of major
Denny
,
of the Ohio volunteers, who remained to
protect
a fortress which had been established on the
bank of the river.
Another attempt was then made to re-open the
communication to the river Raisin, and protect
the supplies which were expected under the
escort
of captain Brush; for which purpose a
detachment
of six hundred men was placed under
the command of lieutenant-colonel Miller, and
marched on this hazardous enterprise the same
evening. At about four o'clock the next
afternoon
,
the van-guard, commanded by captain
Snelling, of the fourth United States' regiment,
was fired on by an extensive line of British
troops and Indians, at the lower part of the
Maguago
,
about fourteen miles from Detroit. At
this time the main body was marching in two
columns
,
and captain Snelling maintained his
position
in a most gallant manner, under a very
heavy
fire, until the line was formed and advanced to
the ground he occupied, when the whole,
excepting
the rear guard, was brought into action. The
enemy were formed behind a temporary
breast-work
of logs, the Indians extending in a thick
wood on their left. The gallant Miller
immediately
ordered the whole line to advance, and
when within pistol shot of the enemy, to make a
general discharge, and perform the rest with the
bayonet.
A scene now commenced, impossible to
describe
.
The Americans contended with a force
one third
superior to their own. Five hundred
Indians, almost entirely naked, horribly painted,
hideously yelling and whooping, were fighting on
almost every side, led on and encouraged by
British
regular troops. But the American troops did
not disgrace themselves nor their country. They
dealt out a full measure of death to the
sanguinary
wretchesthey drove them,
inch by inch
, to
the village of Brownstown, about two miles, when
the enemy took to their boats, and the battle
ended
.
The duration of the action was about two
hours, without a moment's cessation.
The Indians were commanded by Tecumseh,
and, animated by his bravery, fought with great
obstinacy during their retreat. The British were
commanded by major Muir and both these
commanders
were wounded, besides several
subordinates
.
The enemy had been on the ground
several days, fortifying the place, by feeling large
trees and sprang from their hiding places so
suddenly upon the unsuspecting Americans, that
eighteen of the latter were killed, and forty-five
wounded. The actual loss of the enemy could
not be ascertained by the victors, but was,
undoubtedly
,
much greater than their own, as above
forty Indians were left dead on the field, and
many
British prisoners were taken.
Several young officers, among whom was
ensign
Willoughby, had requested permission to
join this detachment as volunteers, and conducted
themselves during the contest in a manner the
most gallant and honorable, and were afterwards
recommended to the general by colonel Miller,
in terms of the most flattering approbation.
Nothing, however, but honor, was acquired by
this victory the communication being opened
only so far as American beyonets could extend.
The necessary care of the sick and the wounded,
and a very severe storm of rain, rendered their
return to camp indispensably necessary; and
after
remaining on the ground the following night,
and part of the next day, they retraced their
steps to Detroit.
CHAPTER XXX.
THE CAPITULATION.
On valor's side the odds of combat lie;
The brave live glorious, or lamented die;
The wreten who trembles in the field of fame.
Meets death, or worse than deatheternal shame.
Pope's Homer
.
After
the battle of Maguago, and the return of
the detachment without effecting the object of
their expedition, the commander in chief became
seriously alarmed for the fate of captain Brush,
and the detention of those supplies on which the
very existence of the army depended. An
express
was therefore immediately dispatched, with
directions for him to take an upper route through
the woods, and to reinforce his detachment with
what militia he could collect in his neighborhood.
On the tenth day of August, the enemy at
Malden
received a reinforcement of four hundred
men, and the next day orders were given for the
American garrison on the Canadian shore to
evacuate
their position, destroy the fortress, and
return
to Detroit. It was now whispered among
the officers, that the general had stated that
a
capitulation
of the army would be necessary!
Though
astonished beyond measure at this intimation,
they were compelled to believe it; for it had
reached them through a medium that admitted of
no doubt. The commanding officers of three
regiments
,
Miller, Cass, and M`Arthur, held a
consultation
on the subject, the result of which was,
a determination to incur, (in the last resort) the
responsibility of divesting the general of his
command
.
On the same day they addressed a letter
to the governor of Ohio, informing him of the
state of affairs.
On the thirteenth, the enemy took a position
opposite Detroit, and began to throw up works.
For two days they pursued their labors without
interruption, and established a battery of
considerable
force. The American commander, from
the loop-holes of retreat, beheld their progress,
but gave no orders to drive them from the position
they had taken. He appeared thoughtful and
irresolute; giving orders one moment, and
countermanding
them the next: thus betraying a total
deficiency in that requisite quality of a hero,
which increases his firmness and confidence in
proportion to the difficulties which assail them.
Whispers of distrust and discontent were
circulated
among both officers and men; and the three
confederated colonels consulted further on the
plan of divesting their timid and irresolute
general
of a command which he was evidently
incompetent
to sustain. But this plan, which might,
perhaps
,
have saved the army, town, and territory,
and gloriously and successfully obtained the
object
of the expedition, was frustrated by an
unexpected
event. Two of this patriotic trio, M`
Arthur
and Cass, were ordered to proceed, by an
upper route, towards the river Raisin, with a
detachment
of four hundred men, to meet the escort
and supplies under captain Brush, and
accompany
them to Detroit.
They marched on this expedition about
sun-set
on Friday evening, and on Saturday, at one
o'clock, a flag of truce crossed the river from
Sandwich, bearing a summons from general
Brock for the surrender of the fort and town of
Detroit; stating that he could no longer restrain
22
the fury of the savages. To this demand an
immediate
and spirited refusal was returned, and,
soon after, the batteries of the enemy were
opened
on the fort and town, on which they continued
to play until evening, when all the British ships
of war came up the river, and anchored opposite
the town.
In the mean time an express, strongly escorted,
had been sent after M`Arthur and Cass, with
orders
for them to return immediately. These
orders overtook the detachment about dark, and
were promptly obeyed.
At day-light, on Sunday morning, the firing on
both sides recommenced, and about the same
time the English began to cross the river and
land at the Springwells, three miles below
Detroit
,
under cover of the fire from their shipping.
They then took up their line of march, moving
in a close column of platoons, twelve in front,
upon the bank of the river.
At this time the American fort began to be
much thronged with women and children, and
the old and decrepit people of the town and
country, who flew thither for protection from the
enemy's batteries and the anticipated barbarities
of the savages.
The enemy continued to advance, and the
Americans were well prepared to receive them.
The fourth regiment was stationed in the fort;
the Ohio volunteers and a part of the Michigan
militia behind some pickets, in a situation in
which the whole flank of the enemy would have
been exposed. The residue of the Michigan
militia were in the upper part of the town to
resist
the incursions of the savages. Two
twenty-four
pounders loaded with grape-shot, were posted
on a commanding eminence, ready to sweep the
advancing column; and the American troops, in
the eager expectation of victory, awaited in
impatient
silence the approach of the enemy. Not
a discontent broke upon the earnot a look of
cowardice met the eye. Every man expected
a proud day for his country, and each was
anxious
that his individual exertion should contribute
to the general result.
When the head of the advancing column
arrived
within about five hundred yards of the
American line, orders were given by general
Hull for the whole to retreat to the fort, and for
the twenty-four pounders
not
to open upon the
enemy. One universal burst of indignation was
apparent upon the receipt of this order. Those
whose conviction was the deliberate result of a
dispassionate examination of passing events,
saw the folly and impropriety of crowding eleven
hundred men into a little work, which three
hundred
men could fully man, and into which the shot
and shells of the enemy were incessantly falling.
The fort was in this manner filled; the men were
directed to stack their arms, and scarcely was an
opportunity afforded of moving. Shortly after
a white flag was hung out upon the walls, and a
British officer rode up to inquire the cause, when
a communication passed between the commanding
generals, which ended in the capitulation of the
whole American army, fort, town and territory.
In entering into this capitulation, the general took
counsel of his own feelings only. Not an officer
was consulted, and no one anticipated a
surrender
,
till he saw the white flag displayed. Even
the women were indignant at so shameful a
degradation
of the American character, and all felt as
they should have felt, but he who held in his
hands the reins of authority.
[16]
[16]
See Cass's letter to the Secretary of War.
About ten o'clock the returning detachment
arrived
within sight of Detroit, and had a firing
been heard, or any resistance visible, they would
have immediately advanced and attacked the
rear of the enemy. The situation in which this
detachment was placed, although the result of
accident
,
was the best for annoying the enemy, and
cutting off his retreat, that could have been
selected
.
With his raw troops enclosed between
two fires, and no hopes of succor, it is hazarding
little to say, that very few would have escaped.
But Hull capitulated, and the American army
became prisoners of war, without being suffered
to raise a weapon in their own defence. Both
privates and officers now ventured to express
their indignant feelings without restraint; the
former
venting their displeasure in oaths and tears,
while many of the latter tore the epaulets from
their shoulders, and broke their own swords for
vexation. What a sight was here for an
American
!
As brave a little army as ever faced a foe,
flushed with the hope of victory, and eagerly
awaiting the approaching contest, were suddenly
deprived of the laurels almost within their grasp,
and obliged tamely to pass in review before an
enemy, as inferior in the quality as in the number
of his forces. Dispirited, hopeless, and
desponding
,
they submitted to their humiliating fate with
the best grace they could; though half of them
shed tears because they had not been permitted
to meet their country's foe, and to fight their
country's battles.
I will conclude this humiliating chapter with
an extract from a letter which ensign Willoughby
wrote to his father, immediately after the
capitulation
.
EXTRACT.
To be taken prisoner, is an occurrence so
frequent in war, that I think nothing of it; but
to be
given away
to an inferior enemyto be
compelled to submit without a trial of strength,
is almost insupportable. The enemy invited us
to meet him in the field, and it was our duty and
interest to fight. If we had been defeated in
battle
,
a capitulation might not have been
dishonorable
,
as it now undoubtedly is. I had rather a
thousand times have fallen on the bloody field,
far from my friends and paternal home, than to
return
thither, as I shortly must, covered with
disgrace
.
I know not exactly what the articles of this
disgraceful capitulation are; but it is understood
among us that the volunteers of our state, and
the militia of Michigan, are to return home on
parole. The regular troops, (many of whom were
heroes on the Wabash) are surrendered as
prisoners
of war. All the public property at this
place is given up, together with the brig Adams,
lately repairing here. Cass and M`Arthur, who
had been sent off with a detachment to open a
communication with the river Raisin, by a
different
route from that of Brownstown, and who were
returning to Detroit, were
included in the
surrender
!
Captain Brush, from Ohio, who was at the
river Raisin, on his march to Detroit with a
volunteer
company, escorting thirteen hundred head
of cattle, and one hundred and fifty barrels of
flour, for the use of the army, was also
included
22*
in the surrender!
A son of colonel Elliott, British
Indian agent, was dispatched to the river Raisin,
to apprise Brush of the terms of the capitulation,
who being a noble fellow,
refused
, and took young
Elliott about thirty miles in his retreat, and then
let him return to Detroit. Brush, it is expected,
will escape back to Ohio; for should they pursue
him, he will have one hundred miles start of the
enemy.
The Ohio volunteers are to be landed at
Cleveland, and one of them has promised to call
at Mulberry-Grove with this letter. I need not
desire you to use him well. If I can obtain a
parole, I shall soon embrace you; if not, God
only knows when I shall see you again. We
shall sail on Wednesday for Fort Erie. Adieu.'
CHAPTER XXXI.
THE ANTIDOTE.
Fame flies before, the messenger of Jove,
And shining soars, and claps her wings above.'
Pope's Homer
.
While
these unfortunate events were
transpiring
at the west end of lake Erie, the Champions
of Freedom had unfurled her standard near its
eastern borders, on the river Niagara.
Detachments
of regular troops and volunteers were
almost
daily arriving at this encampment from all
parts of the country, and a formidable force was
soon collected, under the command of general
Smyth, besides a large body of New-York
militia
,
commanded by general Van Rensselaer.
Arrangements were likewise making, with the
greatest activity, to establish on each of the lakes
a naval force, sufficiently powerful to cope with
that of the enemy. To effect this purpose on
lake Ontario, Sacket's Harbor was protected by
fortifications, and the construction and
establishment
of a respectable lake fleet immediately
commenced
,
under the superintendence and direction
of commodore Chauncey. At Ogdensburg,
east-ward
of lake Ontario, on the river St. Lawrence,
was stationed a detachment of militia, under the
command of brigadier-general Brown, who had
been lately promoted by the governor of
New-York
,
and by him entrusted with the general care
of the northern frontier of that state; the most
important points of which were, by his exertions,
soon placed in a respectable state of defence.
At Plattsburgh, also, on lake Champlain, great
exertions were making to establish a formidable
force under general Bloomfield; and a small naval
establishment was, at the same time, erecting on
the lake, for the purpose of co-operating with,
and facilitating military operations, and
preventing
the enemy from receiving those supplies
which treason might find agents to procure.
A spirit of patriotism pervaded the whole
country, not excepting those who were opposed
to the declaration of war. Volunteer corps were
raising in almost every town; private donations
of money and clothing for the army were
immense
;
and several gentlemen of high standing,
among whom were members of legislative
bodies
,
[17]
[17]
The following is an extract of a letter from a
recruiting officer to
his friend in New-Hampshire:
The
patriotic William C. Belding, (late representative of the town
of
Swanzy) has enlisted in the army of the United States, at Keene,
where I have a rendezvous open, which promises success. I have
only
to add, that Mr. Belding is a man of independent circumstances,
and
in whom even his political enemies cannot find a blemish.
Respectfully, yours,
JAMES
WELLS.
cheerfully shouldered the musket, and
marched at the word of command. Numerous
corps of exempts were also organized, and all
were animated with a desire of restoring the
lustre
of their country's tarnished honor, and were
eager to risk their lives in the cause of injured
Freedom.
In the mean time, the unfortunate victims of
Hull's timidity were sighing in captivity and
inglorious
indolence. The most of them had been
taken to Fort Erie, and from thence to Quebec.
Ensign Willoughby, with thirty others, officers
and privates, were detained on board the late
American brig Adams, which was now attached
to the British naval force on the lake, and called
the Detroit. For many lingering weeks were
they confined to this floating prison, more than
once in sight of that shore where rested our
hero's
dearest hopes.
At length, however, as the autumn advanced,
arrangements were made for sending these
prisoners
also to Quebec; and the Detroit was
ordered
to proceed to Fort Erie, and there land
them for that purpose. In pursuance of this
order
,
she set sail, in company with the brig
Caledonia
,
which was loaded with furs; and on the
morning of the eighth day of October, both
vessels
were anchored under the guns of that
fortress
.
They were soon afterwards boarded by
an officer who took an account of the prisoners,
and made arrangements for their being landed in
the course of the following day. When the name
of Willoughby was read from the roll, the officer
took a packet from his pocket, and presented it to
George, informing him that it had been brought
from Buffalo, two days before, by his son, who
had been made a prisoner by the Americans and
paroled. I feel happy, added he with a smile,
in believing that the duty of a British officer
and that of a Christian are not altogether
incompatible
:
the former compelled me to break that
sealthe latter forbids me to forget that I am a
father, and have had a son in captivity. Our
hero made a suitable reply, and having, at one
glance, recognised his father's writing, eagerly
retired to feast on the contents, and read as
follows
:
Mulberry-Grove, Ohio
,
Sept.
24, 1812.
I have, my brave but unfortunate boy,
written
several letters, and directed them to you at
different military posts in Canada; but know not
whether either of them has been fortunate enough
to reach you. Mr. Fleming, who departs for
Buffalo to-morrow morning, expects to meet a
young Irish prisoner there, to whom he can
safely
confide this letterhe being the son of
Fleming's
particular friend.
The conduct of your late commander is
universally
condemned on this side the lines, and is,
I have no doubt, the theme of ridicule on the
other side. But this will afford no consolation to
a generous mind; it will rather be an addition to
the pains of captivity, to reflect that our country
gains neither honor nor profit by our misfortunes.
But do not despond. A brighter day shall
dissipate these clouds, and bid our drooping
laurels
revive. Remember, that
In struggling with misfortunes,
Lies the proof of virtue;
and that the order of Providence is such, that
real
good is often the result of
apparent
evil;
even the misfortune which we now lament, may
yet prove a real and lasting benefit to our
country
.
Perhaps we are already indebted to it for
the patriotic flame which is now blazing from
Georgia to Mainefrom the Illinois to the
Atlantic
coast. Every revolving dayalmost every
passing hour, is fraught with intelligence that
inspires
me with the ardor of youth; and I glory
in the conviction that my young countrymen are
worthy of their patriotic sires. Let this
reflection
console you in captivity, and banish
unavailing
regret from your bosom. Bear up with manly
fortitude against the hardships of your present
state, and look forward with hope to the future.
By bearing misfortunes
well
, we acquire that
elevation
of soul which teaches us to despise them.
In adversity
The mind grows strong by buffeting the tempest;
But, in success dissolving, sinks to ease,
And loses all her firmness.
A more fortunate destiny awaited your
cousin
Aylwin; and Hull on the ocean has more than
redeemed what was lost by Hull on the land. On
the very day that your general sailed a captive
from Detroit, his nephew on the ocean covered
the name of Hull with imperishable glory, and
dissolved the charm on which the vaunted
omnipotence
of Britain depended. The very hour
that beheld you a desponding captive, heaped on
your cousin Aylwin a full measure of fame.
You may, perhaps, have heard of the
glorious
event to which I allude, although your
situation
may have prevented your learning the
particulars
.
I know not if you are permitted to read
newspapers, or have an opportunity of seeing
those published in the United States. All that
they have yet contained relative to this event,
formed the subject of my last letter: what I shall
now communicate, is the substance of one which
I this morning received from your brother-in-law
Morse, and which contains, besides, the most
pleasing assurances of your sister's health and
happiness, and the general welfare of all your
friends and relatives in that metropolis. These
particulars may be depended upon as correct,
they having been communicated to Morse by
Aylwin
himself, who arrived at Boston on the
thirty-first
day of last month.
Presuming that you have heard nothing of
your cousin since he left you at Norfolk, to join
his frigate at Annapolis, I will commence my
brief narrative at the time of his sailing on his
first cruise, which was on the twelfth day of
July.
The Constitution had been but four days at
sea, when, near Cape May, she fell close in with
a whole British squadron, consisting of one ship
of the line, four frigates, a brig, and a schooner;
the nearest frigate within gun-shot. It was a
dead calm, and the only headway to be made was
by towing. The English attached all their boats
to two frigates, and, by hard rowing, gained fast
on the Constitution, so as to bring some of their
bow guns to bear on her. In this situation they
continued all day, the Constitution occasionally
firing her stern chasers; and it was not until the
next morning that a light breeze enabled her to
escape from an enemy so much superior in force
as to render a contest desperate. The whole
chase lasted sixty hours, and during all that time
the gallant crew of the Constitution remained at
their stations without a murmur.
Aylwin, on this occasion, as sailing-master,
availed himself of his station to evince his
superior
seamanship, and received the highest
encomiums
from his commander, for the judicious
management of the Constitution; nay, it has
since been ascertained, that the English
commanders
themselves expressed the greatest
admiration
of the skill displayed in the manuvring
and final escape of the American frigate. One
of them actually threatened to hang his own
sailing-master
to the yard-arm if he did not lay his
ship along-side the Constitution; swearing that
the opportunity was worth a knighthood to him.
On arriving in port, after effecting this escape,
Aylwin wrote me a letter, in which he gave a
modest
relation of the foregoing circumstances, and
expressed his confidence of the ultimate success
of our little navy. I feel, says he, all
possible
conviction, and I can well judge from having
been in the British navy, that they have not a
single
frigate of equal force with the Constitution,
but what must, if we fall in with her and go fairly
at it, strike her colors. Thank Heaven, in this
chase, we had no occasion to be brought to the
test; but there was not a countenance on board
that displayed any thing like yielding without an
heroic struggle. There seemed to be a solemn
gloom in each visage, as if sensible of such a too
early misfortune, yet combined with a cast of
desperate
resolution. It is not seldom that I have
examined the human face in the hour of battle;
and I never before saw a truer stamp of courage
than was then to be found in every sailor's
countenance
.
He then adds, that (being in haste)
this account is an exact duplicate of one he had
just written to a particular friendprobably to
yourself.
On the fifteenth of August, the day before
your general's unfortunate capitulation, captain
Hull again put to sea, and in four days after (for
it seems that this ship cannot be a longer period
on the ocean without encountering some
important
event) fell in with the Guerriere, an English
frigate, mounting forty-nine carriage guns, and
manned with above three hundred men. After
exchanging some long shot by way of
compliment
,
(to use your cousin's expression) the two
ships engaged in a close and obstinate contest for
ten minutes, when the mizen-mast of the
Guerriere
was shot away by the board; and in ten
minutes
more, his bowsprit was in the mizzen chains
of the Constitution. Our brave tars made
immediate
preparations to board, but her two other
masts falling at that moment, it was thought
unnecessary
.
In
fifteen minutes
from the
commencement
of close action, the enemy fired his
lee gun
,
in token of submission.
Captain Dacres, who commanded the
Guerriere
,
was wounded in the action; and besides
losing so fine a ship, had fifteen of his brave
associates
killed in the battle, and sixty-four
wounded
.
In addition to this, upwards of twenty, who
were stationed in the tops, were carried
overboard
with the masts. On board of the
Constitution
there were but seven killed, and as many
more wounded. The Guerriere was so
completely
riddled, that captain Hull thought it best to set
her on fire, after removing the prisoners, and
blow her up.
23
The number
nineteen
seems to have been an
unfortunate one for the Guerriere. On the
nineteenth
of July, six years since, she was captured
from the French, by the English frigate Blanche,
after a contest of forty-five minutes; and on the
nineteenth
of August last, she was sent to the
bottom
after a much shorter struggle. Captain
Daeres
is the son of the late admiral Dacres, and
was made post captain in the year eighteen
hundred
and six.
Aylwin received a slight wound from a
musket
ball. The style in which he brought his
ship into action, and the manner in which he
manuvred
her throughout the battle, has procured
him the applause of captain Hull and all on board.
Since their return to port, he has been appointed
an acting lieutenant, which is the second instance
in our navy of promotion from the grade of
sailing-master
.
Now, if you envy your cousin Aylwin, I will
not chide you; for I know that you are not
susceptible
of a wish to pluck a single leaf from his
laurel chaplet, merely because your own brows
are not yet decorated with one. Your turn will
yet comeI know it will; and I do not flatter
you in asserting that you earned a few sprigs at
Maguago, where your conduct was highly
approved
by colonel Miller, who was pleased to say, in
a letter to a friend of mine, that ensign
Willoughby
would make a hero, worthy his gallant
father.
If all I have yet written is not a sufficient
balm for your wounded spirits, I will again call
your attention to the exhilirating theme of
American
patriotism, in instances of which your
native
state (for so you choose to call Ohio) stands
unrivalled, though not alone.
About two thousand volunteers, completely
armed and equipped, and furnished with thirty
days' provisions, have mounted their war-horses,
and are at Urbana, destined to protect our
frontiers
from savage barbarity, until relieved by the
army now on their march thither. They are
composed
of the most respectable and useful citizens
the state of Ohio can boast. Our quota of
drafted
militia are now organized, and will in a few
days be ready to take the field, when Ohio will
present, for the service of the nation,
seven
thousand
as brave and hardy soldiers as ever pulled a
trigger. A company is also organized in
Cincinnatti
,
and completely armed, consisting of such
citizens as are legally exempt from military duty
on account of age, official situations, and
invalidity
,
including ministers of the gospel of different
denominations. Their object is the defence of
the adjacent frontier in case of emergency.
Our neighbors in Kentucky are not much
behind
us. When the news of the fall of Detroit
reached Lexington, instead of deploring the loss,
the citizens immediately set about repairing it.
An immense number of volunteers immediately
came forward, among whom were several
members
of congress, and shouldered their muskets
in their country's cause. Four hundred regulars,
and eighteen hundred volunteers, have marched
from that state to the general rendezvous at
Urbana
.
They are (to use the language of my
informant
)
some of the best stuff in Kentucky
they seem indignant at the late news, anxious to
wipe off the stain from the American name; and
all of them are eager and determined to march
under
the banner of Harrison, who has taken the
command of the western army. Three complete
regiments of infantry, one regiment of cavalry, and
five hundred mounted riflemen, are also on their
way to take the same route. Colonel James
Smith, distinguished for his services during the
Indian war and revolution; who was one of the
Black Boys of the Sliding Hill expedition, in the
state of Pennsylvania; and who is now
eighty
years of age, has gone to join the army under
general
Harrison. He has gone to fight the battles
of his country; not by paper declarations, or
oral wailings; nothe
report of his gun
is to
give to the enemy the first warning of his injured
feelings. The greatest enthusiasm prevails
throughout the whole western country: almost
every man has volunteered his services; and, if
we may judge from appearances, it will not be
long before these back-woods-men wipe away
the stain upon the American arms, by the
ignominious
surrender of Detroit, and the whole
Northwestern army.
The citizens of Albany, in the state of
New-York
,
immediately on hearing of the surrender
of general Hull, commenced a subscription for
raising a regiment of volunteers. Very liberal
subscriptions were made for the comfort and
convenience
of those who might offer their services.
A regiment of volunteers is also raising in the
city of Baltimore, and fifteen thousand dollars
have already been subscribed for the purpose of
furnishing the men with every thing necessary for
their comfort. Fifteen hundred men are
immediately
to march from Virginia, to rendezvous at
Point Pleasant, on the Ohio. The LADIES of
Richmond volunteered their services to make
tents, knapsacks, &c. for the soldiers, and in a
few days all things were ready.
In short, our newspapers are filled with
instances
of loyalty and zeal, which promise that
the war will produce much heroism, and secure a
final triumph over the enemy. Towns and
districts
are turning out hundreds and thousands of
volunteers; citizens, exempted by age or
otherwise
from military duty, are forming themselves
into corps, for defence of the country, committees
of public safety, correspondence, &c. Camps
are forming near the Canada lines, for the
purpose
of invading that country. At or near
Niagara
there are at least four thousand troops, and
large numbers at Greenbush: to both these
stations
considerable numbers are yet expected.
The New-England people will, notwithstanding
the insinuations to the contrary, do their duty;
the people of Canada are discontented,
oppressed
,
and sullenly silent; privateering increases
with general and astonishing activity; warlike
stores, ammunition, &c. are forwarded to the
different
posts and depots in great quantities; and,
to sum up all, the nation is rapidly assuming that
armed attitude which leaves nothing to fear
every
thing to hope.
One instance more of genuine patriotism,
and I have done with that subject for the present.
I know that it will please you, for the patriot is a
particular friend of yours, the old gentleman who
last winter performed an essential piece of
service
for you in Norfolk, and for whom you have
so often expressed the warmest esteem and
gratitude
.
It seems that he has been solicited by some
of his children, who reside in the interior of
Virginia
,
to remove higher up the country, in order
23*
to be out of the reach of danger in case of
invasion
of the sea-board by the enemy. In his
answer
he thus expresses himselfI feel none of
those alarms which some of our citizens do, to
induce me to move away and leave our houses
behind us, instead of staying at home in order to
be ready with our guns upon our shoulders, to
turn out and protect our property. God forbid
that I should be so base as to move off in time of
danger, and leave others behind me to fight my
country's cause. No! let me die an honorable
death rather than give up one inch of ground to
the enemies of my country. I may move, but I
hope no faster than I am forced. I was once
young, and am now near sixty,
and never did I
see a real friend to his country suffer; for the Lord
will provide for them;
so I have recommended
old and young to stand ready, and dispute every
inch of ground with the enemies of our country,
and to despise every man, without respect to age,
who shall move away, and expect others to do
that duty which his country demands, and in
which he ought to participate.
I shall extend this letter to a mammoth size,
at the rate I go on; I will therefore conclude with
a brief narrative of a few war events that
have transpired since the conquest of
Sandwich
.
On Sunday morning, the nineteenth of July
last, the English sailors on lake Ontario, having
a mind to divert themselves a little on the
Sabbath
,
in what they thought a defenceless port,
made an attack on Sacket's Harbor, not
expecting
,
I presume, to find a single gun mounted at
that place.
Early in the morning, an English squadron
of five sail was discovered beating up for the
harbor, consisting of the Royal George, carrying
twenty-four guns; the Prince-Regent, of
twenty-two
;
the Earl Moira, of twenty; the Seneca, of
eighteen; and another whose name and force I
have forgotten. The troops were immediately
called to arms, and expresses sent to call in the
neighboring detachments and volunteers, who
arrived
in the course of the day to the amount of
nearly three thousand. Soon after sun-rise, the
Prince-Regent brought to and captured the
custom-house
boat, about seven miles from the
harbor
,
on her return from Gravelly Point. The
boat's crew were liberated and set on shore, with
a message to colonel Bellinger, the commandant
at the Harbor, demanding the surrender of the
brig Oneida, and the late British schooner
Nelson
,
seized for a breach of the revenue laws, and
fitting for a privateer; and declaring, that in case
of a refusal to surrender the vessels, the
squadron
would burn the village, or lay the inhabitants
under contribution. Soon after this, captain
Woolsey left the harbor in the Oneida, and ran
down within a league of the squadron; when he
returned, and moored his vessel on a line with a
battery which had been recently erected, with
springs on his cables. Captain Woolsey being
the most experienced engineer present, left the
Oneida under the command of a lieutenant, and
went on shore and took the command of a
thirty-two
pounder, mounted the day before on the
battery
,
the other guns of which consisted of
nine-pounders
.
By this time, the enemy had arrived within
gun-shot; the Royal George, as flag-ship, ahead;
and firing was commenced from the thirty-two
pounder. This was returned by the squadron,
which stood off and onand a brisk cannonading
was reciprocally continued for more than two
hours, all our guns being well manned and
served
and
it was plainly discovered that the Royal
George and Prince Regent were much injured.
At this time, as the flag-ship was wearing, to give
another broadside, a ball from the thirty-two
pounder was seen to strike and rake her
completely
;
after which the squadron fired but a few
guns, and bore away for Kingstonour brave
citizens
giving three hearty cheers, and greeting
the ears of his majesty's faithful subjects with
the well-remembered tune of
Yankee Doodle
from
all the music at the postnot a man being hurt
on our side. One of our shot carried away the
fore-top-gallant-mast of the Prince Regent.
The officers, detached troops, volunteers,
and citizens, universally displayed a degree of
firmness, intrepidity, and patriotism, on the
occasion
,
worthy the Champions of Freedom.
The action was maintained within point-blank
shot. Most of the enemy's balls struck the rocks
below the battery, and one thirty-two pound shot
was picked up by our citizens, it having lodged
near the breast-work.
Sacket's Harbor, however, has since been
better fortified, and has become the naval depot
of lake Ontario. Captain Chauncey, late
commandant
of the naval force in the harbor of
New-York
,
has been appointed to create, equip, and
man a considerable squadron on that lake, of
which he is to have the command.
On the fifteenth of August last, the day
before
you became a prisoner. Fort Chicago, (
commonly
called Fort Dearborn) situated at the head
of the Illinois, near lake Michigan, was evacuated
by the American garrison, who were nearly all
massacred, after leaving the fort, by the Indians,
who were besieging it. This fort was
commanded
by captain Heald, who had, a few days before,
received orders from general Hull to evacuate the
post, and proceed with his corps to Detroit, after
disposing of the public property as he should
think best. But before he could leave the fort,
he found himself compelled to capitulate with the
savages who surrounded it; and the terms agreed
to by both parties were, that the Indians should
spare the lives of the garrison, who were to have
as much of the arms, ammunition, provisions, &c.
as they could carry away. Captain Wells, who
had come from Fort Wayne to conduct the
garrison
to that place, at night ordered a quantity of
powder and balls to be thrown into the Chicago
river, to prevent its falling into the hands of the
Indians; which, when they discovered in the
morning, so incensed them, that they fired upon the
garrison about a mile from the fort, and a terrible
slaughter ensued. Three women and nine
children
were among the slain; captain Wells had
his breast cut open, and his heart roasted and
eaten
by the chiefs present. Captain Heald, the
commandant of the garrison, and his lady, were
both wounded; the former through both his
thighs, and the latter by a rifle ball in her
wrist, and another through the same arm. Their
lives were saved by Mr. Burnet, a trader, who
was among the Indians: he claimed them as
friends, and offered to purchase their ransom.
Captain Heald and his lady are now at St.
Josephs
,
with Mr. Burnet. There were no British
officers or troops in this engagement.
Fort Harrison, commanded by captain
Taylor
,
was attacked on the night of the fourth
instant
,
by a numerous body of Indians, who
attempted
to make a breach by firing the
block-house
;
but by great exertions the fire was
extinguished
;
and after a severe contest, which lasted
the whole night, the Indians were dispersed, and
relinquished the attack. There is every reason
to believe that the fort has since been relieved,
as a respectable force has been sent for that
purpose. Captain Taylor has been brevetted a
major for his gallant defence of the fort.
Fort Bellevue, on the Mississippi, was also
attacked about the same time, and gallantly and
successfully defended by lieutenants Hamilton
and Vasques.
I will confess that I am not altogether without
apprehensions for the safety of the settlers on
the southern borders of Erie. The English are
at present complete masters of the lake, and the
movements of the savages on the Canadian side
are suspicious, to say the least of them. The
invitations
and lures held out to the Indians on this
side, and the removal into Canada of the
Sandusky
tribe, has excited considerable
apprehensions
,
especially in the citizens of Erie. But I
hope for the best.
My old friend and fellow-soldier, Dearborn,
the hero of your temple-scene at Ellen's
masquerade
,
who, you know, was last winter appointed
a major-general in the army, has actually taken
the field against his old enemies. If the English
still remember Saratoga, the name of Dearborn
will strike a panic in their hearts. I believe his
head-quarters are at Albany.
Our friend Brown, the quaker, has been
promoted
from a colonel to a brigadier-general, and
with about five hundred militia, is entrusted with
the defence of Ogdensburgh, on the St.
Lawrence
.
Harrison, the hero of the Wabash, has been
appointed a major-general, and, as I have before
mentioned, has taken the command of the
Northwestern
army. By the last accounts from the
westward, he was proceeding rapidly towards
Fort Wayne, which was said to be besieged by
the Indians; and vast numbers of volunteers
were marching from different parts to reinforce
himso that it may be fairly calculated, that in
a short time he will have ten thousand men under
his command; men who are thirsting to redeem
the tarnished honor of the American arms. If
our western troops are properly furnished with
provisions and the munitions of war, you may
soon expect to hear of the American standard
being
again reared in Upper Canada, by a force
which shall bear down all opposition.
General Bloomfield has a considerable force
at Plattsburgh, on our northern frontier; and the
continual marching of troops to reinforce him,
seem to indicate an intention of making a
descent
upon Canada from that quarter.
The unfortunate inhabitants of Richmond
have been again visited with a distressing
calamity
.
On Wednesday, the sixteenth instant, the
powder-mills were blown up with a most terrible
explosion, and the mangled remains of fifteen
unfortunate
beings, employed in the buildings, were
scattered in almost every directionlegs broken,
sculls fractured, carcases almost cut in two,
arms torn off, were scattered about in horrible
profusion. One corpse was thrown a hundred
yards, into the trunk of a tree; an arm and hand
driven three or four hundred yards from the scene
of wo.
While these events have been taking place
on land, others of not less interest have occurred
on the turbulent domains of Neptune.
On the twenty-third of June last, two days
after leaving port, commodore Rodgers, in the
frigate
President, had a running fight with the
English
frigate Belvidere. In this affair, which
lasted
more than three hours, the Belvidere had two
men killed, and twenty-two wounded, but finally
escaped after lightening, by throwing overboard
her boats, casks, spars, and, it is believed, some
of her guns.
The President received a considerable
number
of shot in her sails and rigging, but was not
materially injured. The chase was continued
till midnight, when it was relinquished as
hopeless
,
and the President hove to for the squadron
to come up. Early in the chase, one of the
President's
chase-guns, on that side for a
considerable
time. The President had three killed and
nineteen wounded, most of the latter slightly; of
the wounded, sixteen were by the bursting of the
gun. It was by the same gun commodore
Rodgers
had his leg fractured, but has recovered.
While I am on this subject, I cannot refrain
from mentioning an instance of juvenile heroism
in a young midshipman on board the President;
who, though scarcely thirteen years of age,
conducted
himself, through the whole of this affair,
like a veteran hero. A twenty-four pound shot
from the Belvidere wounded him in the left hip,
carried away his pistols and dirk, broke three of
his ribs, and so shattered his arm as to render
immediate
amputation necessary; the whole of
which he bore with the calmness of a stoic. The
same shot killed three men, and wounded two
others. Eight days afterwards a sail was
descried
,
supposed to be an enemy; when,
notwithstanding
the severity of the youngster's wounds,
he flew upon deck, and reported himself fit for
duty, requesting that his name might be struck
from the doctor's books; which request,
however
,
was not complied with. His name is
Nathaniel
Lawrence Montgomery
, cousin to
captain James Lawrence, of the Hornet, and son
of Dr. Thomas W. Montgomery, a physician of
high standing in the city of New-York, who has
three sons, all in the navy. What patriot would
not be a father? One of his sons is a surgeon on
board the Essex, captain Porter: and this
reminds
me of another event, which is the last I
will trouble you with at this time.
On the thirteenth of August, his Britannic
majesty's sloop of war Alert commenced an
action
with the Essex, and in eight minutes struck
her colors, with seven feet water in her hold,
and much cut to pieces, with three men wounded.
The Dey of Algiers has declared war against
the United States; and here I close my budget of
news. If its perusal will tend to lighten in the
least the weight of the captive's chain, I shall
think that the hour I have been writing has not
been mispent. Heaven bless you, and restore
you speedily to your country and friends.
Farewell
.

CHAPTER XXXII.
THE EMANCIPATION.
The darkest hour of sorrow's night
Precedes the rosy dawn of light.
Anon
.
In
reading his father's letter, traversing the
deck, and gazing wishfully at the American shore,
our impatient hero lashed on the tardy hours.
The shades of evening at length began to
descend
upon Niagara's dusky wave, and the
eastern
landscapes, browned by the breath of
autumn
,
became gradually shrouded with a mantle
of gloom. Still he lingered, to watch the distant
lights, which, to his view, shone like the stars of
Liberty, glittering from her favored shore, and
marking the happy abodes of freemen.
The tattoo's drowsy clamor aroused him from
his reverie, and, with a deep sigh, he left his
position
,
and directed his gaze to the westward.
The moon was visiblea rayless crescent,
slowly
descending to the horizonand but a few stars
peeped through the scattered fragments of
autumnal
clouds. The wind sighed sadly through
the rigging, while the rippling of the current
against the vessel's prow, produced a melancholy
response. It was not now a scene to cheer the
drooping spirits of a captive soldier, and he left
it to seek relief among the gay spirits assembled
in the officers' ward-room; but found none, until
he retired to his own birth, when he was visited
by the drowsy god of slumber, who sat on his
eye-lids until three hours past the noon of
night.
From a sweet dream of happiness, our hero
was suddenly awakened by an unusual noise
above him; in the next instant, the clash of arms
and report of pistols roused every slumberer from
his hammock, and the English sailors flew upon
deck, where tumult and confusion appeared to
reign for several minutes. Again all was still,
and, in a moment after, the American prisoners
were summoned, and informed that the vessel had
changed masters; and that, if agreeable, the
Englishmen
would exchange situations with them,
and occupy their births below. The sensations
produced by this intelligence can be better
conceived
than described. In ten minutes from the
first alarm, their former guards were all secured
as prisoners, and the vessel under weigh. The
Caledonia was also under sail, having suffered a
simultaneous surprise.
An attempt was first made by the captors, in
both vessels, to stem the course of the river, and
enter lake Erie; but that was soon found to be
impracticable
,
owing to the rapidity of the current,
and the lightness of the wind; orders were
therefore
given to alter their course, and run down the
river.
The morning now began to dawn, and the
vessels
were opposite the British batteries, in a river
not a mile in width. They were obliged to pass
these forts under a dreadful fire of round, grape,
and canister, which was poured into them from
heavy ordnance and light artillery. The
Caledonia
was fortunate enough to gain in safety the
American shore, and anchored under one of the
American batteries at Black Rock, effectually
covered
from the fire of the enemy; while the
Detroit
was compelled to cast anchor within four
hundred yards of two batteries that were
incessantly
venting their blazing fury upon her. The
commander of the Detroit hailed an officer of the
flying artillery on shore, assuring him that if
another
gun was fired on the brig, he would bring
the prisoners on deck, and expose them to the
same fate that awaited the rest. This threat was,
however, disregarded, and a destructive fire
continued
to assail them.
The eyes of George were now, for the first
time, directed to the young hero of this daring
enterprise, but sought in vain to trace in his
manly
visage a disposition to put so barbarous a
threat in execution. He looked again, and knew
the countenance; it was the youth whose
nuptials
he had so unexpectedly attended, seven
months before, in Virginiait was the gallant
Elliott. This was not a moment, however, for
George to discover himself.
All the guns had been brought on that side of
the vessel which was next to the enemy, and the
brave fellows stationed at them returned the fire
of their enemies with interest, as long as their
ammunition lasted. An attempt was then made
to send a line to the American shore, by which
the vessel might be drawn in; but not a breath
of wind was stirring, and the current ran so
rapidly
that the boat could not reach the shore.
Attempts
,
equally fruitless, were also made to send
lines on board from the river bank.
Almost every shot from the enemy took effect
on this unfortunate vessel; her severed rigging
dangled in strings, her canvas hung in ribbons,
and every part of her hull that appeared above
water, was disfigured with wounds.
Elliott now ordered the cable to be cut, with
an intention of drifting down the stream beyond
the reach of the hostile batteries, and there
making
a stand against the flying artillery. A few
light airs played over the river, and every piece
of canvas not rendered entirely useless, was
displayed
to catch them. After drifting a few
minutes
,
gradually nearing the eastern bank of the
river, she struck on a sand-bar at the head of
Squaw Island, and there grounded, still exposed
to the British fire.
Finding it impossible to get her off, Elliott
reluctantly
abandoned her; having previously sent
ashore the prisoners. An active scene now
ensued
;
the deserted vessel was immediately
boarded
by above forty English soldiers, who were
nearly every one destroyed by a brisk fire now
opened upon the brig from the American
artillery
,
commanded by lieutenant-colonel Scott.
Thus this contested prize lay between two
hostile
forts, exposed to the fire of both, and was
soon unable to float; she was therefore set on fire
by the Americans, and burnt to the water's edge.
During this contest, the American army lost a
very valuable officer, who was killed by a
grape-shot
from across the river, as he was
approaching
the beach on horseback. This was major
Cuyler, aid to general Hall, a gentleman
universally
esteemed, and deservedly so; for he
possessed
that warmth of feeling which is the
brightest
ornament of valor; that spirit of liberality
and frankness which is a virtue in every breast,
but pre-eminently so in the bosom of a soldier.
It was not until evening that George ventured
to seek an interview with his brave friend and
deliverer
;
and the pleasure resulting from it was a
24*
rich compensation for all his recent misfortunes.
At his earnest request, Elliott related to him
those particulars relative to his unexpected
emancipation
from captivity, with which he was as yet
necessarily unacquainted.
The command of lake Erie, said he, has
been entrusted to me, for the present, with
instructions
to create and equip a squadron, as soon
as possible, able to meet the whole naval force of
the enemy. In pursuance of my orders, I have
already purchased some vessels in the river for
the use of government, but find myself much
embarrassed
with the difficulty of getting them up
the Niagara into the lake. When the Detroit
and Caledonia anchored yesterday under fort
Erie, I instantly formed the resolution of
boarding
,
and, if possible, obtaining possession of two
such fine vessels; for though my instructions only
extend to
building
and
purchasing
, I still conceive
that
capturing
is by far the most expeditious and
economical method of constructing a navy.
A body of brave tars were on their way to
this place from New-York, destined for the lake
service, and I heard that they were but a short
distance off; I therefore dispatched an express
to the officers, desiring them to use all possible
expedition in getting on their men, as I had
important
service to perform. On their arrival,
which was about twelve o'clock yesterday, I
discovered
that they were not furnished with either
cutlasses or battleaxes, and had only about
twenty
pistols among them all. But on application
to generals Smyth and Hall, of the regulars and
militia, I was supplied with a few arms; and
general
Smyth was so good, on my request, as
immediately
to detach fifty men from the regulars,
armed with muskets.
By four o'clock in the afternoon, I had my
men selected, and stationed in two boats, which I
had previously prepared for the purpose. With
these boats, fifty men in each, and under
circumstances
very disadvantageous, the men having
scarcely had time to refresh themselves after a
fatiguing march of five hundred miles, we put off
from the mouth of Buffalo creek, at one o'clock
this morning, and at three were alongside the
vessels. In the space of about ten minutes, we
had the prisoners all secured, the topsails
sheeted
home, and the vessels under way.
Unfortunately
the wind was not sufficiently strong to get
us up against a rapid current into the lake, where
I had understood another armed vessel lay at
anchor
,
and we were therefore obliged to run down
the river by the forts.
In boarding the Detroit, one of my men was
killed, and acting midshipman Cummins received
a bayonet through his leg. For a few minutes, I
was assailed by three powerful Englishmen,
whom I kept at bay with my cutlass alone. The
boat which boarded the other vessel was
commanded
by sailing-master Watts, who performed
his duty in a masterly style. During the whole
affair, only six Americans have been injured, one
of whom is dead, and four others, I fear, are
mortally
wounded; an almost miraculous escape,
considering our exposed situation.
CHAPTER XXXIII.
A FRUITLESS CONTEST.
And now both hosts their broken troops unite,
In equal rank, and mix in mortal fight.
They strike, they push, they throng the scanty space,
Resolv'd on death, impatient of disgrace,
And where one falls another fills his place.
Dryd. Virg.
The
active part which lieutenant-colonel Scott
had taken in the foregoing events, his ardor in
dislodging the enemy from the contested prize,
and the readiness with which he afforded her the
protection of his cannon, secured him the
friendship
of Elliott, and excited a peculiar interest in
the breast of George to learn the history of so
promising an officer. All the information,
however
,
that he could acquire respecting the gallant
subject of his curiosity, was, that he was born
and educated in Virginia, where, for six years,
he had been in the practice of the law, with
flattering
indications of success; that the attack
upon
the frigate Chesapeake, which kindled into a
flame every young and active spirit of the nation,
first roused him from the calm pursuits of peace,
and induced him to accept a captaincy in a
regiment
of light artillery; that he had ever since
prosecuted his military studies with unremitting
ardor; that soon after the declaration of war, he
had been promoted to the rank of
lieutenant-colonel
in the second regiment of artillery,
commanded
by Izard; and that he had recently
arrived
on the Niagara with two companies of his
regiment, which were posted at Black Rock, to
protect the navy-yard. In the foregoing
spirited
little affair, he first `fleshed his maiden sword.'
Like the hero of Sweden, he had heard the bullets
whistle around him, and determined that from
thenceforth that should be his music.
A few days had elapsed since our hero's
restoration
to liberty, when he was informed that a
secret
expedition was on foot at Lewiston, the
head-quarters of the Northern army, in which
colonel Scott had been invited to participate. He
therefore immediately applied for and obtained
permission to serve in the projected enterprize;
and by forced marches through mud, rain, and
sleet, arrived at Lewiston, under the
enterprizing
Scott, early on Tuesday morning, the
thirteenth
of October.
The successful gallantry of Elliott in
recovering
the two brigs, had excited in all the frontier
troops a strong disposition to be actively
employed
.
They had become weary of an indolent
encampment
;
and hearing that their brethren in
arms, on other stations, were almost daily reaping
laurels in successful skirmishes, they wished for
similar opportunities, and murmured against their
commander for not giving them orders to act.
General Van Rensselaer was not insensible to
this disposition in the soldiers under his
command
;
and he inferred from it that a crisis in the
campaign was rapidly advancing, and that it was
an object of immediate necessity to strike some
bold and important blow, or consent to relinquish
the objects for which so much toil and expense
had been incurred.
Under these impressions, he determined to
make a descent upon Queenston, on the
Canadian
shore, dislodge the enemy from the heights,
and gain possession of the village, where the
troops might be sheltered from the inclemency of
the approaching winter.
At this time, there was at Lewiston about two
thousand five hundred militia, raw and
undisciplined
,
besides detachments of regulars, which
had arrived from Fort Niagara, under
lieutenant-colonels
Fenwick and Chrystie, and major
Mullany
,
to join in the expedition. Two columns,
of three hundred men each, were to make a
simultaneous
descent on the British shore; one of
them to be led by Chrystie, the other by colonel
Van Rensselaer, who had the chief command of
the expedition. As soon as the heights should be
carried, Fenwick was to pass over with the light
artillery, Mullany to follow with his detachment,
and other troops to succeed in order.
Such were the arrangements which had been
made, when the gallant Scott, with his intrepid
little division, arrived at Lewiston, at four o'clock
in the morning. Finding no boats suitable for
the transportation of artillery, he was obliged to
restrain the ardor of his troops, and place them
in battery on the American shore, where, at
day-break
,
they opened a spirited fire, to clear the
opposite bank while the landing was effected. All
the boats which had been collected, were divided
equally between the two advancing columns, but
were insufficient to embark the whole at once,
and were altogether inadequate to the service for
which they had been collected.
The movements of the Americans were soon
discovered by the enemy, and a brisk fire of
musketry was poured from the whole line of the
Canada shore, and immediately after, three
blazing
batteries scattered a shower of destruction
among the advancing boats, dimpling the river
on every side of them. Scott's two pieces of
artillery
,
under the command of Towson and
Barker
,
kept up a sweeping fire on the opposite
shore, and they were assailed in return by shells
from the enemy's mortar.
The river at this place was a sheet of violent
eddies, which much embarrassed the boats, so
that it was with great difficulty they could
proceed
in any order. Colonel Van Rensselaer,
however, soon reached the opposite shore, with
about one hundred men, a portion of each column,
and effected a landing amidst a tremendous fire,
directed upon him from every point, against
which his column advanced very tardily.
Chrystie
had been less fortunate; his boat was soon
perforated by the enemy's fire, and became
unmanageable
,
while he received a shot in his hand.
With some difficulty he regained the American
shore, about half a mile below the point of
embarkation
,
and afterwards crossed in another
boat. Several of these frail vehicles had been
destroyed in this attack, many of the pilots and
boatmen deserted the enterprize, and every thing
connected with it began to wear an inauspicious
aspect.
As soon as the remaining boats had returned,
Fenwick and Mullany embarked, with as many of
their men as could be carried, amounting to about
two hundred in all. Destitute of pilots, and
exposed
to an impetuous current, they were
compelled
to land where they could, and found
themselves
immediately under the enemy's batteries,
where the whole were made prisoners, except
eight or ten men, who escaped with Mullany in
his boat; Fenwick was severely wounded in
three or four places.
Ensign Willoughby, who had hitherto assisted
in serving Towson's piece of artillery, was
burning
with impatience to participate in the glory of
a closer contest. He had witnessed the fate of
Fenwick's detachment, saw the tardiness with
which embarkations were effected, and trembled
for the fate of the little band who were
desperately
maintaining the footing they had gained. He
was now relieved at the gun, and, without
waiting
for orders, or even asking permission, rushed
to the shore, and sprang into the first boat that
was departing.
In the mean time, the troops which had
effected
their landing under Van Rensselaer, were
hotly engaged, and gradually gaining ground on
the enemy; but their leader had scarcely
advanced
two hundred paces when he received four
wounds, and was forced to leave the field; not,
however, without having first ordered his officers
to proceed with rapidity, and storm the fort; at
the same time imparting to them such local
information
as he possessed with respect to the ground
which was to be contested.
The troops now acted without a common
commander
;
the regulars took the lead, led on by
their respective captains, Wool, Malcolm,
Armstrong
,
Ogilvie, and lieutenant Randolph. Other
small parties, of twenty or thirty men each,
followed
on as the boats successively arrived.
Sixty determined young heroes, ten of whom
were militia, followed their leaders up the heights,
and having gallantly carried a battery which was
planted midway the declivity, gained the great
height called the mountain. Here they gave three
cheers, and rushed like tigers upon the
astonished
foe, who received them on the points of their
bayonets. After the third charge, however, the
enemy's consolidated phalanx was broken, and
driven down the hill in every direction.
Each individual of this intrepid band, merits a
niche in the temple of Fame; would I could
rescue
all their names from oblivion, and enrich this
page by recording them. But such is the fate of
war, that Alexanders and Csars may fall
unnoticed
in the ranks, and the most exalted merit
(unless decorated with an epaulet) exist
unacknowledged
and unrewarded. Their leader was
the heroic Ogilvie, seconded by the undaunted
Wool, who was still bleeding from the wounds he
had received; and by his side rushed on the
impetuous
Willoughby; lieutenants Kearney, Carr,
Hugginian, Sammons, Randolph, and
Gansevoort
,
with ensign Reeves, followed with
enthusiasm
,
each one emulous to be foremost in danger.
Whatever be the names or rank of the
remaining
sixty, the noblest title in the gift of their
country
is incontestably theirsthe
Champions of
Freedom
.
Completely beaten and dispersed by this
handful of men, the fugitives fled to the village of
Queenston, where they were met and rallied by
general Brock, who had brought with him a
considerable
detachment, and instantly advanced to
the charge.
The Americans still possessed the hill, to which
the path of ascent was winding and difficult; but
no difficulties can deter the braveBrock led on
his undaunted followers in the very face of death.
His horse fell under him, and he advanced on
foot. Young Willoughby, whose ardor had kept
him constantly in front of the hottest battle,
received
a ball in his hip, and would have fallen
but for the ready arm of a private soldier named
Wilklow, who exclaimedCourage, my dear
sirI have just unhorsed the British general.
25
And I have done nothing; replied Willoughby;
but give me your rifle and I may disperse the
whole column. With considerable difficulty,
still supported by the soldier, he levelled the piece
and fired. The gallant but unfortunate Brock
fell lifeless to the earth within an hundred paces
of the American line, and his panic-struck
followers
fled in disorder, notwithstanding all the
exertions
of their officers to bring them back to the
charge. Men who in Egypt had acquired the
title of
Invincibles
, became a fugitive rabble in
front of a phalanx of FREEMEN.
Again the Americans had time to breathe, and
were, in the interval, joined by Scott, who had
been ordered over to take the command of the
whole of the troops engaged; but the presence
of general Wadsworth, who commanded the
militia
,
enabled him to confine his attention to the
regulars, consisting of about two hundred and
thirty men, whose courage and ardor had
increased
with the difficulties that opposed them. Scott
immediately drew his little army up into a strong
position, in which he could at once receive the
enemy and cover the ferry; for he every moment
expected to be reinforced by all the troops at
Lewiston.
By this time a large body of Indians, who had
been collected at Fort George, were on their way
to the scene of action. Their approach was
announced
to the routed invincibles, who were, with
some difficulty, again rallied, and in conjunction
with their red allies, brought to the charge. A
short but terrible conflict ensued. Again were
the Champions of Freedom victorious; again
were the enemy completely routed by the rifle and
bayonet, and compelled to fly in the wildest
disorder
,
while the Americans pursued them as far
as was compatible with the protection of the ferry,
from whence a reinforcement was still expected.
It was with some difficulty, however, that the
ardor
of pursuit could be checked by the officers,
and the flushed victors reinstated in their
former
commanding position.
During this action, the commander-in-chief
himself was on the ground, and in expectation of
further attacks, gave immediate orders for
fortifying
and strengthening the position of the troops.
But perceiving no signs of an approaching
reinforcement
from the American shore, he
immediately
recrossed the river to accelerate the
movements
of the militia, and urge them to embark.
But, alas! their ardor had entirely subsided, and
no arguments could induce them to proceed. In
vain the general rode through the ranks and
conjured
them by every thing they held dear or
valuable
,
to join their brave countrymen in the field;
in vain colonel Bloom exhibited his bleeding
wounds, and exhorted them to accompany him in
search of redressthey forgot to what country
they belonged, and seemed content to witness the
fate of their brethren on the opposite shore, while
they themselves were far removed from danger.
Nothing was wanting but their presence to secure
the hard-earned victory, and prevent a renewal
of the contest; and yet they refused to embark!
The British invincibles had now again rallied.
Ashamed of their disorderly flight before a
handful
of men who had never witnessed a regular
engagement
,
they were at length induced to renew
the attack. With direful whoops and yells, the
savages commenced the assault, and several
American
bosoms recoiled from the impetuous
charge. The advanced pickets gave way, and
a host of fierce demons, blood-stained and
horribly
painted, plunged into the midst of the
American
lines. All was now confusion, horror, and
dismay; defeat and massacre seemed, for a
moment
,
inevitable, and were only prevented by the
cool and deliberate bravery of Scott. Animated
by his courage and example, the broken and
retreating
column suddenly turned upon the foe, and
throwing itself forward with resistless
impetuosity
,
bore down all before it, and again turned the
tide of war. The enemy once more fled with
precipitation, leaving a horrid rampart of
human
bodies in front of the American lines.
After these frequent defeats, the enemy was
content to wait the arrival of a column of eight
hundred and fifty fresh troops from Fort George,
which were perceived advancing with rapidity,
and were now within a mile of Queenston Heights,
commanded by general Sheaffe. Chrystie and
Mullany at this moment gave Scott the
unwelcome
intelligence that no aid was to be expected
from Lewiston, except a supply of cartridges;
but that if a retreat was resorted to, general Van
Rensselaer would endeavor to cover it with his
cannon, and send as many boats as possible to
receive them.
Scott was thunderstruck at this intelligence:
and, to increase his mortification, it was
immediately
afterwards ascertained that every boat still
remained fastened to the American shore. The
British reinforcements continued to advance, and
the light troops and Indians were ready to renew
the battle. Retreat having now become to the
Americans almost as hopeless as succor, Scott
resolved
to receive the enemy on the ground which
he occupied; when, if any survived the shock, it
would be time enough to surrender.
Sheaffe approached warily with his force;
obliqued to the right from the road, and formed a
junction with the Indians, in the rear of the
Heights. No doubt he suspected that the little
band of Americans in view was but the out-post
of the principal army. But, whatever he thought,
he advanced with firmness to the charge, when a
most obstinate and bloody conflict commenced.
Scott was determined on a desperate stand
before
he yielded; and gave his orders with
intrepidity
and coolness, amid a scene that would have
filled common breasts with dismay. The clash
of arms, the incessant roar of musketry, the
dreadful
thunder of ordnance, and the still more
appalling
yell of savages, mingled in horrid
confusion
;
while the ground ran with blood, and was
thickly covered with mangled bodies. At length
they closed, with a shock that made the solid
mountain tremble to its base. Scott's little band
of heroes, consolidated into a close phalanx, stood
the charge undismayedalmost unmoved; while
many of the desperate assailants were impaled
on their bristling bayonets.
Nothing, for some minutes, could shake this
little phalanx; but it was every moment growing
weaker, being exposed to a cannonade that
carried
death in every discharge. At length, being
nearly surrounded on all sides, they gave way,
broke, and made a precipitate retreat to the bank
of the river, and halted under cover of a precipice
which protected them from a shower of musketry
that rattled like hail-stones over their heads.
Here Scott mustered the panting fugitives, and
found that his little army had dwindled to one
hundred and thirty nine.
END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.Mulberry Grove, Ohio
,
Nov.
12, 1811.
My SonI have strange things to tell you
events that will excite your special wonder,
and which may almost cause you to doubt the
veracity of your father. Attend, therefore, while
I relate a series of facts as extraordinary as any
that ever figured in romance, either ancient or
modern.
In my last I mentioned the illness of your
auntI then considered it trifling; but yesterday
her mortal part was committed to its sister earth.
On Wednesday evening last, the sixth instant,
she appeared to be considerably better,
conversed
cheerfully, and desired me to seek for some
repose
,
as for the three preceding nights and days
I had scarcely closed an eye. A little after eleven
o'clock, she fell into a quiet sleep; when
commending
her to the care of the nurse, I composed
myself in the old easy chair, wrapped in my
great-coat, before a cheerful fire. It was some
time, however, before sleep visited my eyes; my
mind was occupied with far distant events, and
the picture of the Mysterious Chief hung
immediately
in my view over the fire-place. The
contemplation
of this object insensibly led me into a
train of reflections, with which you was
necessarily
connected, and in this frame of mind I fell
asleep.
My waking ideas pursued me in my dreams;
and wild forests, frightful precipices, treacherous
ambuscades, and tented fields, floated in wild
confusion
before my bewildered fancy. At length,
events appeared to occur in a more regular and
connected series; the battle of Miami rapids was
fought over again, with all its attendant
particulars
,
and the oracular corpse lay stretched before
me.
Suddenly, the scene was changed, and I found
myself wandering alone on the shores of Erie;
no habitation was visible, all seemed desolate,
and I felt lost and bewildered. In the midst of
my perplexity, I saw the figure of a man with a
drawn sword in his hand, emerging from the
wood with a slow and solemn step. It was the
same form that I had left lifeless on the
battle-field
,
but no wound nor blood was now visible.
With a dignified step, he advanced to the place
where I was standing, and with a smile of
benignity
tendered me his weapon; but in attempting
to take it, my hand trembled, and the sword fell to
the ground with a noise that awakened me.
I started from my chair, and found by the
clock that I had slept more than two hours. I
advanced
softly to the bed, and found both patient
and nurse in a sound sleep, and that of your aunt
appeared so sweet and gentle that I forebore to
awaken the nurse, and feeling considerably
refreshed
by my nap, determined to watch the
remainder
of the night myself.
I left the bed and walked to the window,
where I amused myself awhile in gazing on the
etherial expanse glowing with myriads of golden
stars; the waning moon was riding in cloudless
majesty over the eastern forests, and her silver
rays glittered on the bosom of the frozen lake.
As I turned again towards the fire, my steps
were impeded with something which, on
examination
,
I found to be the sword of Washington. It
had fallen, with its scabbard, from the hook by the
window, and lay nearly unsheathed upon the floor.
The noise produced by its falling must have been
that which awakened me so suddenly from my
dream; but
why
it should have fallen(and at
that particular moment too)was a mystery I
could not unravel. In my dream, the sword
presented
by the chief had fallen from my hand,
either through carelessness or terror. What did
that portend? The one I now replaced on the
hook, had long been idle in its scabbard. Was it
a reproof for remissness? That could not be, for
my country had all that time been at peace. Did
this weapon,
Self unscabbarded, foreshow
The footsteps of a secret foe?
*
*
Scott's Lady of the Lake.
While indulging such reflections, I again
threw myself into the chair; and, without
intending
it, was instantly asleep. My former dream
returned with all its particulars, and I was again
awakened in exactly the same manner, for
A clang
Of angry steel that instant rang.
*
With a kind of instinct I turned my eyes to the
spot where I expected to see again the prostrate
sword. I saw it not. The clock at that moment
struck three.
I feel, my son, a reluctance to proceed; for
you will immediately suspect that watching and
anxiety have turned your poor father's brain.
But, think of it as you will, I will leave nothing
untold. The same figure that appeared in my
dream, the exact counterpart of the picture on the
wall, in the same dress, and with the same aspect,
stood before me!
I was not in the least terrified, though the
circumstance
was such as would naturally produce
that sensation. To have unexpectedly discovered
an armed savage in my house at midnight,
hovering
round the couch of slumber, would, at any
other time, have much alarmed me; but now I
only felt surprised that a dream could thus be
continued after I believed myself to be awake.
I rubbed my eyes, and involuntarily exclaimed,
Is it possible!
still slowly advancing to the
mysterious apparition, who smiled as I
approached
,
with the same aspect of dignified benignity
that I admired in my dream.
My sword was in his hand! but not undrawn.
He gracefully presented me the hilt, with the same
courteous smile and majestic attitude that graced
the immortal hero who first tendered it to my
acceptance
.
Take it, said he in accents that thrilled to
my very soul; take it, and redeem your vow.
I had never forgotten the tones of that
mysterious
voice which announced your birth. I now
heard them again. After staring a moment in
astonishment, I exclaimed.Am I asleep or
awake? This is, indeed, a most singular dream!
The mysterious stranger heard me with
a smile, and then mildly replied: This is no
dream; the time has arrived for dormant
patriotism
to arouse, and for those who are destined to
defend their country to commence that sacred
duty.
My surprize, if possible, was heightened by
this address; and though I was fully convinced
that I was still dreaming, I felt an ardent curiosity
to hear an explanation of his meaning. I therefore
asked him, as I received the weapon, what
danger
threatened the safety or happiness of my
country. To which he answered:
The Wabash will run with human blood
before
the dawn of morning. Even now the
ambush
is laid, the tomahawk raised, and the
scalping-knife
sharpened. Treachery lurks round the
white men's camp. A prophet strikes at the
heart of your country: and all this is but the
bloody prelude of a long and more dreadful
contention
,
15
the result of which will depend on that of
the approaching battle.
If the valor of white
men foil the treachery and ferocity of the cruel foe,
then the Champions of Freedom will conquer in the
subsequent contest with a mighty empire
. If not
Washington has lived in vain, and the blood of
patriots flowed for nothing.
Admitting your assertion and prediction to be
true, I replied, still, why am
I
called upon?
There are thousands more capable of serving
their country, who possess hands to raise in her
defence.
You have a son, whom you devoted to his
country before you knew that he existed. Him
have I lately seen basking in the treacherous
sunshine of ease and pleasure. Rouse him
to a sense of his duty, and the high calling to
which he is destined. The day approaches that
will light him to the field. Before he can fully
acquire the art of defence, the soil of Freedom will
be prest by foreign hostile steps, and stained
with the blood of her children.
Prophet! spirit! angel! or devil! I
exclaimed
;
whatever you are, should the event of the
coming morning verify your prediction, I will
comply with your injunctions. Nay, moremy
son shall receive my consent to follow the bent of
his inclination, which I know will immediately
lead him from college to the army. But satisfy
me on one point: You seem to be a man; at any
rate you wear not the countenance of a demon;
how happens it that you bear so strong a
resemblance
to that picture?
Resemblances, answered he, are no proofs
of identity. Many a man has been mistaken for
another.
But tell me, said I, what is your name? to
what tribe do you belong?and how gained you
admittance here?
Your sister sleeps, said he, pointing to the
bed, without noticing my question; she will
shortly sleep to wake no more on earth.
My eyes were directed for a moment to your
aunt; she moved, and I flew to the couch. She
did not awake, and I returned to resume the
conference
with my mysterious guest; when, guess
my astonishment, he had disappeared! No door
had openedno footstep had soundedbut the
chief was nowhere to be found.
Surelysurely this is nothing but a dream!
I exclaimed with a vehemence that awakened the
nurse.
What is the matter, sir? cried she, starting
from the chair in which she had been so long
snoring by the side of the bed.
Matter! I exclaimedcome to me quick!
take hold of me! shake mewake me!
Wake you! repeated the good woman,
rubbing
her eyes, and then staring with the most
unaffected surprise'tant possible, sure, that
you are talking and walking in your sleep?
I made her no answer, for at that moment I
conceived a plan of ascertaining, the next day,
whether I had been thus imposed upon by an
illusive
dream or not, and this plan I resolved to put
into immediate execution. I opened my
escritoir
and wrote down the particulars as above stated,
which I deposited in a certain pigeon-hole, and
once more threw myself into the easy-chair, and
fell into an undisturbed slumber which lasted
until
after sunrise.
For nearly the whole day I avoided my
escritoir
,
being determined, in the first place, to
convince
myself fully that I was not only awake, but
in my right reason. I conversed a little with your
aunt, who had slept quietly till morning, and
seemed much relieved; I chatted a while with the
nurse, directed the threshers in the barns, visited
Cleveland, and transacted business with several
people; until every doubt was removed as to
the sanity of my mind, or the wakefulness of my
body. Then, towards evening, I ventured to look
for my singular narrative, and found it in the spot
where I left it; and yet, notwithstanding all this
mass of evidence, I almost doubted my own
senses.
A few days, however, removed all doubts
from my mind. Yesterday morning an express
passed the Grove on the way to Erie, bearing the
intelligence of a dreadful battle that was fought,
last Thursday morning
, by the army under
general
Harrison, with the combined Indians under
the Shawanoe prophet. As the particulars of this
battle may not have reached Boston, I will relate
them as far as communicated by the express,
who stopped a few minutes at my house for
refreshment
.
On the twenty-ninth of October last, the
governor
of Indiana, with a small army, left Fort
Harrison, on an expedition, the object of which
was to break up a combination formed by the
Shawanoe prophet on the Wabash, inimical to the
tranquility and interests of the United States.
After a long and hazardous march, they
reached the prophet's town on Wednesday, the
sixth instant. Here the general held a parley with
some chiefs who met him for that purpose, when
it was mutually agreed to suspend all further
discussion
until the next day, and that, in the mean
time, no hostile step should be taken on either
side.
The American army then encamped on the
banks of the Wabash, but were attacked the next
morning, a little after four o'clock, by a host of
savages, led by the treacherous prophet; and so
sudden and unexpected was the assault, that it
fared hard with many of our brave countrymen,
some of whom were scalped in their tents. The
Americans formed, however, with all possible
expedition
,
and after a sharp contest of two hours,
succeeded in beating them off with great loss, and
the victory was decided with the bayonet. Two
hundred fell wounded on our side, about seventy
of them never to rise again. A much larger
number
of the Indians were destroyed, and the
prophet's
town was burnt to ashes.
Thus, my son, was literally fulfilled one
prediction
of the
Mysterious Chief
. Who can this
being be? I am not superstitious; but `there are
things in heaven and earth not dreamt of in our
philosophy.' Is he supernatural? But I forbear
to ask questions of one as unable to satisfy these
doubts as I am myself. Whoever he be, I shall
comply with my engagement, and you have my
free consent to enter the army or navy as soon as
you please. The relinquishment of your studies
will be a great sacrifice, but if we are on the eve
of a war, as this unknown Indian has predicted, you
cannot too soon commence a military life. `In
time of peace prepare for war,' is the language
of the hero whose name you bear, and whose
sword you are to wield. I know your generous,
daring spirit, and unless it has been much
relaxed
by the new sphere in which you are
moving
,
your soul is now `in arms, and eager for the
15*
fray.' A very singular agent was made the
instrument
to announce your birth; a very singular
agent now claims your services for our common
country. `
I have a son to redeem my vow
.'
I possess sufficient influence at the seat of
government to procure you a commission, but
shall not apply for it until you accompany me
thither in person. I shall set out immediately for
Boston, so that you will not do wrong to expect
me in the first week of December. I have been
informed that a bill will be shortly laid before
congress
,
which will probably pass, for raising an
army of thirty thousand men, so that our
application
will be in good season.
As to the
marvellous
part of this letter, I would
recommend you to keep it a secret for the
present; possibly we may yet discover a clue to
unravel the mystery. The particulars of the
Wabash
battle will soon appear in all the
newspapers
.
It is probable that the account I have given
is not correct in all its parts.
Harrison, you have heard me mention, was
aid to the gallant Wayne, in the battle of your
birth-day; he is a man of fine talents, and
possesses
a perfect knowledge of the topography of
this state and the adjacent territories.
The pretended prophet who has thus led
these deluded people to ruin, is brother to that
Tecumseh, whose inveterate animosity against
the people of the United States you have heard
Logan mention. Some of the newspapers have
represented him to be Red Jacket, the celebrated
warrior who commanded the Indians by whom we
were defeated, in the year one thousand seven
hundred and ninety-two, under St. Clair. But
this I know to be incorrect. He was indeed in
that battle, but was then too young to command.
It is said that at the age of fifteen, this Indian
disappeared from his relatives, and was
considered
as finally lost; that he strolled to Quebec, and
from thence to Montreal, where he remained
several years; and in this space received an
education qualifying him to act the part of a
prophet
.
Among the sciences which he studied, that
of astronomy was his favorite, and the only one
in which he made any considerable proficiency.
By his calculations he discovered that a comet
was about to make its appearance, whose orbit
would approximate so near to that of our earth
as to give rise to that tremulous motion which has
lately been sensibly felt in several parts of the
United States, the earth alternately
preponderating
between two great attractive powers.
With this calculation of the cometary influence
in his pocket, the prophet left Quebec, and
immediately
set about forming the Wabash
combination
,
instigated, no doubt, by his hot-headed
brother, the fiery Tecumseh. He went on an
embassy to the Creeks, in the month of August
last, and required them to unite in the northern
coalition, and on their refusing, he solemnly
announced
,
in the public square, that `a
lamp
would shortly appear in the west to aid him in his
hostile attack upon the whites; and that if they
would not be influenced by his persuasion, the
earth would ere long tremble to its centre.'
The lamp
is
in the westthe earth
has
shaken. No wonder that these circumstances
should have had a powerful effect on the minds of
these untutored Indians, and tended greatly to
strengthen the confederacy. I shall be but a few
days behind this letter.
Adieu.Washington City
,
June
4, 1812.
May it please your Excellency
,
The plot thickenswar is inevitable
and the folly or madness of democracy fully
established
.
The vassals of Bonaparte in the house
of representatives, have agreed to enlist these
States under the banners of the tyrant against
England; there can be no doubt of the senate's
concurrencewar will be declared in a few days
Detroit is the sally-portlook to Sandwich,
and expect further particulars as soon as they
transpire.
Your ever faithful friend,
X.Mulberry-Grove, Ohio
,
Sept.
24, 1812.
I have, my brave but unfortunate boy,
written
several letters, and directed them to you at
different military posts in Canada; but know not
whether either of them has been fortunate enough
to reach you. Mr. Fleming, who departs for
Buffalo to-morrow morning, expects to meet a
young Irish prisoner there, to whom he can
safely
confide this letterhe being the son of
Fleming's
particular friend.
The conduct of your late commander is
universally
condemned on this side the lines, and is,
I have no doubt, the theme of ridicule on the
other side. But this will afford no consolation to
a generous mind; it will rather be an addition to
the pains of captivity, to reflect that our country
gains neither honor nor profit by our misfortunes.
But do not despond. A brighter day shall
dissipate these clouds, and bid our drooping
laurels
revive. Remember, that
In struggling with misfortunes,
Lies the proof of virtue;
and that the order of Providence is such, that
real
good is often the result of
apparent
evil;
even the misfortune which we now lament, may
yet prove a real and lasting benefit to our
country
.
Perhaps we are already indebted to it for
the patriotic flame which is now blazing from
Georgia to Mainefrom the Illinois to the
Atlantic
coast. Every revolving dayalmost every
passing hour, is fraught with intelligence that
inspires
me with the ardor of youth; and I glory
in the conviction that my young countrymen are
worthy of their patriotic sires. Let this
reflection
console you in captivity, and banish
unavailing
regret from your bosom. Bear up with manly
fortitude against the hardships of your present
state, and look forward with hope to the future.
By bearing misfortunes
well
, we acquire that
elevation
of soul which teaches us to despise them.
In adversity
The mind grows strong by buffeting the tempest;
But, in success dissolving, sinks to ease,
And loses all her firmness.
A more fortunate destiny awaited your
cousin
Aylwin; and Hull on the ocean has more than
redeemed what was lost by Hull on the land. On
the very day that your general sailed a captive
from Detroit, his nephew on the ocean covered
the name of Hull with imperishable glory, and
dissolved the charm on which the vaunted
omnipotence
of Britain depended. The very hour
that beheld you a desponding captive, heaped on
your cousin Aylwin a full measure of fame.
You may, perhaps, have heard of the
glorious
event to which I allude, although your
situation
may have prevented your learning the
particulars
.
I know not if you are permitted to read
newspapers, or have an opportunity of seeing
those published in the United States. All that
they have yet contained relative to this event,
formed the subject of my last letter: what I shall
now communicate, is the substance of one which
I this morning received from your brother-in-law
Morse, and which contains, besides, the most
pleasing assurances of your sister's health and
happiness, and the general welfare of all your
friends and relatives in that metropolis. These
particulars may be depended upon as correct,
they having been communicated to Morse by
Aylwin
himself, who arrived at Boston on the
thirty-first
day of last month.
Presuming that you have heard nothing of
your cousin since he left you at Norfolk, to join
his frigate at Annapolis, I will commence my
brief narrative at the time of his sailing on his
first cruise, which was on the twelfth day of
July.
The Constitution had been but four days at
sea, when, near Cape May, she fell close in with
a whole British squadron, consisting of one ship
of the line, four frigates, a brig, and a schooner;
the nearest frigate within gun-shot. It was a
dead calm, and the only headway to be made was
by towing. The English attached all their boats
to two frigates, and, by hard rowing, gained fast
on the Constitution, so as to bring some of their
bow guns to bear on her. In this situation they
continued all day, the Constitution occasionally
firing her stern chasers; and it was not until the
next morning that a light breeze enabled her to
escape from an enemy so much superior in force
as to render a contest desperate. The whole
chase lasted sixty hours, and during all that time
the gallant crew of the Constitution remained at
their stations without a murmur.
Aylwin, on this occasion, as sailing-master,
availed himself of his station to evince his
superior
seamanship, and received the highest
encomiums
from his commander, for the judicious
management of the Constitution; nay, it has
since been ascertained, that the English
commanders
themselves expressed the greatest
admiration
of the skill displayed in the manuvring
and final escape of the American frigate. One
of them actually threatened to hang his own
sailing-master
to the yard-arm if he did not lay his
ship along-side the Constitution; swearing that
the opportunity was worth a knighthood to him.
On arriving in port, after effecting this escape,
Aylwin wrote me a letter, in which he gave a
modest
relation of the foregoing circumstances, and
expressed his confidence of the ultimate success
of our little navy. I feel, says he, all
possible
conviction, and I can well judge from having
been in the British navy, that they have not a
single
frigate of equal force with the Constitution,
but what must, if we fall in with her and go fairly
at it, strike her colors. Thank Heaven, in this
chase, we had no occasion to be brought to the
test; but there was not a countenance on board
that displayed any thing like yielding without an
heroic struggle. There seemed to be a solemn
gloom in each visage, as if sensible of such a too
early misfortune, yet combined with a cast of
desperate
resolution. It is not seldom that I have
examined the human face in the hour of battle;
and I never before saw a truer stamp of courage
than was then to be found in every sailor's
countenance
.
He then adds, that (being in haste)
this account is an exact duplicate of one he had
just written to a particular friendprobably to
yourself.
On the fifteenth of August, the day before
your general's unfortunate capitulation, captain
Hull again put to sea, and in four days after (for
it seems that this ship cannot be a longer period
on the ocean without encountering some
important
event) fell in with the Guerriere, an English
frigate, mounting forty-nine carriage guns, and
manned with above three hundred men. After
exchanging some long shot by way of
compliment
,
(to use your cousin's expression) the two
ships engaged in a close and obstinate contest for
ten minutes, when the mizen-mast of the
Guerriere
was shot away by the board; and in ten
minutes
more, his bowsprit was in the mizzen chains
of the Constitution. Our brave tars made
immediate
preparations to board, but her two other
masts falling at that moment, it was thought
unnecessary
.
In
fifteen minutes
from the
commencement
of close action, the enemy fired his
lee gun
,
in token of submission.
Captain Dacres, who commanded the
Guerriere
,
was wounded in the action; and besides
losing so fine a ship, had fifteen of his brave
associates
killed in the battle, and sixty-four
wounded
.
In addition to this, upwards of twenty, who
were stationed in the tops, were carried
overboard
with the masts. On board of the
Constitution
there were but seven killed, and as many
more wounded. The Guerriere was so
completely
riddled, that captain Hull thought it best to set
her on fire, after removing the prisoners, and
blow her up.
23
The number
nineteen
seems to have been an
unfortunate one for the Guerriere. On the
nineteenth
of July, six years since, she was captured
from the French, by the English frigate Blanche,
after a contest of forty-five minutes; and on the
nineteenth
of August last, she was sent to the
bottom
after a much shorter struggle. Captain
Daeres
is the son of the late admiral Dacres, and
was made post captain in the year eighteen
hundred
and six.
Aylwin received a slight wound from a
musket
ball. The style in which he brought his
ship into action, and the manner in which he
manuvred
her throughout the battle, has procured
him the applause of captain Hull and all on board.
Since their return to port, he has been appointed
an acting lieutenant, which is the second instance
in our navy of promotion from the grade of
sailing-master
.
Now, if you envy your cousin Aylwin, I will
not chide you; for I know that you are not
susceptible
of a wish to pluck a single leaf from his
laurel chaplet, merely because your own brows
are not yet decorated with one. Your turn will
yet comeI know it will; and I do not flatter
you in asserting that you earned a few sprigs at
Maguago, where your conduct was highly
approved
by colonel Miller, who was pleased to say, in
a letter to a friend of mine, that ensign
Willoughby
would make a hero, worthy his gallant
father.
If all I have yet written is not a sufficient
balm for your wounded spirits, I will again call
your attention to the exhilirating theme of
American
patriotism, in instances of which your
native
state (for so you choose to call Ohio) stands
unrivalled, though not alone.
About two thousand volunteers, completely
armed and equipped, and furnished with thirty
days' provisions, have mounted their war-horses,
and are at Urbana, destined to protect our
frontiers
from savage barbarity, until relieved by the
army now on their march thither. They are
composed
of the most respectable and useful citizens
the state of Ohio can boast. Our quota of
drafted
militia are now organized, and will in a few
days be ready to take the field, when Ohio will
present, for the service of the nation,
seven
thousand
as brave and hardy soldiers as ever pulled a
trigger. A company is also organized in
Cincinnatti
,
and completely armed, consisting of such
citizens as are legally exempt from military duty
on account of age, official situations, and
invalidity
,
including ministers of the gospel of different
denominations. Their object is the defence of
the adjacent frontier in case of emergency.
Our neighbors in Kentucky are not much
behind
us. When the news of the fall of Detroit
reached Lexington, instead of deploring the loss,
the citizens immediately set about repairing it.
An immense number of volunteers immediately
came forward, among whom were several
members
of congress, and shouldered their muskets
in their country's cause. Four hundred regulars,
and eighteen hundred volunteers, have marched
from that state to the general rendezvous at
Urbana
.
They are (to use the language of my
informant
)
some of the best stuff in Kentucky
they seem indignant at the late news, anxious to
wipe off the stain from the American name; and
all of them are eager and determined to march
under
the banner of Harrison, who has taken the
command of the western army. Three complete
regiments of infantry, one regiment of cavalry, and
five hundred mounted riflemen, are also on their
way to take the same route. Colonel James
Smith, distinguished for his services during the
Indian war and revolution; who was one of the
Black Boys of the Sliding Hill expedition, in the
state of Pennsylvania; and who is now
eighty
years of age, has gone to join the army under
general
Harrison. He has gone to fight the battles
of his country; not by paper declarations, or
oral wailings; nothe
report of his gun
is to
give to the enemy the first warning of his injured
feelings. The greatest enthusiasm prevails
throughout the whole western country: almost
every man has volunteered his services; and, if
we may judge from appearances, it will not be
long before these back-woods-men wipe away
the stain upon the American arms, by the
ignominious
surrender of Detroit, and the whole
Northwestern army.
The citizens of Albany, in the state of
New-York
,
immediately on hearing of the surrender
of general Hull, commenced a subscription for
raising a regiment of volunteers. Very liberal
subscriptions were made for the comfort and
convenience
of those who might offer their services.
A regiment of volunteers is also raising in the
city of Baltimore, and fifteen thousand dollars
have already been subscribed for the purpose of
furnishing the men with every thing necessary for
their comfort. Fifteen hundred men are
immediately
to march from Virginia, to rendezvous at
Point Pleasant, on the Ohio. The LADIES of
Richmond volunteered their services to make
tents, knapsacks, &c. for the soldiers, and in a
few days all things were ready.
In short, our newspapers are filled with
instances
of loyalty and zeal, which promise that
the war will produce much heroism, and secure a
final triumph over the enemy. Towns and
districts
are turning out hundreds and thousands of
volunteers; citizens, exempted by age or
otherwise
from military duty, are forming themselves
into corps, for defence of the country, committees
of public safety, correspondence, &c. Camps
are forming near the Canada lines, for the
purpose
of invading that country. At or near
Niagara
there are at least four thousand troops, and
large numbers at Greenbush: to both these
stations
considerable numbers are yet expected.
The New-England people will, notwithstanding
the insinuations to the contrary, do their duty;
the people of Canada are discontented,
oppressed
,
and sullenly silent; privateering increases
with general and astonishing activity; warlike
stores, ammunition, &c. are forwarded to the
different
posts and depots in great quantities; and,
to sum up all, the nation is rapidly assuming that
armed attitude which leaves nothing to fear
every
thing to hope.
One instance more of genuine patriotism,
and I have done with that subject for the present.
I know that it will please you, for the patriot is a
particular friend of yours, the old gentleman who
last winter performed an essential piece of
service
for you in Norfolk, and for whom you have
so often expressed the warmest esteem and
gratitude
.
It seems that he has been solicited by some
of his children, who reside in the interior of
Virginia
,
to remove higher up the country, in order
23*
to be out of the reach of danger in case of
invasion
of the sea-board by the enemy. In his
answer
he thus expresses himselfI feel none of
those alarms which some of our citizens do, to
induce me to move away and leave our houses
behind us, instead of staying at home in order to
be ready with our guns upon our shoulders, to
turn out and protect our property. God forbid
that I should be so base as to move off in time of
danger, and leave others behind me to fight my
country's cause. No! let me die an honorable
death rather than give up one inch of ground to
the enemies of my country. I may move, but I
hope no faster than I am forced. I was once
young, and am now near sixty,
and never did I
see a real friend to his country suffer; for the Lord
will provide for them;
so I have recommended
old and young to stand ready, and dispute every
inch of ground with the enemies of our country,
and to despise every man, without respect to age,
who shall move away, and expect others to do
that duty which his country demands, and in
which he ought to participate.
I shall extend this letter to a mammoth size,
at the rate I go on; I will therefore conclude with
a brief narrative of a few war events that
have transpired since the conquest of
Sandwich
.
On Sunday morning, the nineteenth of July
last, the English sailors on lake Ontario, having
a mind to divert themselves a little on the
Sabbath
,
in what they thought a defenceless port,
made an attack on Sacket's Harbor, not
expecting
,
I presume, to find a single gun mounted at
that place.
Early in the morning, an English squadron
of five sail was discovered beating up for the
harbor, consisting of the Royal George, carrying
twenty-four guns; the Prince-Regent, of
twenty-two
;
the Earl Moira, of twenty; the Seneca, of
eighteen; and another whose name and force I
have forgotten. The troops were immediately
called to arms, and expresses sent to call in the
neighboring detachments and volunteers, who
arrived
in the course of the day to the amount of
nearly three thousand. Soon after sun-rise, the
Prince-Regent brought to and captured the
custom-house
boat, about seven miles from the
harbor
,
on her return from Gravelly Point. The
boat's crew were liberated and set on shore, with
a message to colonel Bellinger, the commandant
at the Harbor, demanding the surrender of the
brig Oneida, and the late British schooner
Nelson
,
seized for a breach of the revenue laws, and
fitting for a privateer; and declaring, that in case
of a refusal to surrender the vessels, the
squadron
would burn the village, or lay the inhabitants
under contribution. Soon after this, captain
Woolsey left the harbor in the Oneida, and ran
down within a league of the squadron; when he
returned, and moored his vessel on a line with a
battery which had been recently erected, with
springs on his cables. Captain Woolsey being
the most experienced engineer present, left the
Oneida under the command of a lieutenant, and
went on shore and took the command of a
thirty-two
pounder, mounted the day before on the
battery
,
the other guns of which consisted of
nine-pounders
.
By this time, the enemy had arrived within
gun-shot; the Royal George, as flag-ship, ahead;
and firing was commenced from the thirty-two
pounder. This was returned by the squadron,
which stood off and onand a brisk cannonading
was reciprocally continued for more than two
hours, all our guns being well manned and
served
and
it was plainly discovered that the Royal
George and Prince Regent were much injured.
At this time, as the flag-ship was wearing, to give
another broadside, a ball from the thirty-two
pounder was seen to strike and rake her
completely
;
after which the squadron fired but a few
guns, and bore away for Kingstonour brave
citizens
giving three hearty cheers, and greeting
the ears of his majesty's faithful subjects with
the well-remembered tune of
Yankee Doodle
from
all the music at the postnot a man being hurt
on our side. One of our shot carried away the
fore-top-gallant-mast of the Prince Regent.
The officers, detached troops, volunteers,
and citizens, universally displayed a degree of
firmness, intrepidity, and patriotism, on the
occasion
,
worthy the Champions of Freedom.
The action was maintained within point-blank
shot. Most of the enemy's balls struck the rocks
below the battery, and one thirty-two pound shot
was picked up by our citizens, it having lodged
near the breast-work.
Sacket's Harbor, however, has since been
better fortified, and has become the naval depot
of lake Ontario. Captain Chauncey, late
commandant
of the naval force in the harbor of
New-York
,
has been appointed to create, equip, and
man a considerable squadron on that lake, of
which he is to have the command.
On the fifteenth of August last, the day
before
you became a prisoner. Fort Chicago, (
commonly
called Fort Dearborn) situated at the head
of the Illinois, near lake Michigan, was evacuated
by the American garrison, who were nearly all
massacred, after leaving the fort, by the Indians,
who were besieging it. This fort was
commanded
by captain Heald, who had, a few days before,
received orders from general Hull to evacuate the
post, and proceed with his corps to Detroit, after
disposing of the public property as he should
think best. But before he could leave the fort,
he found himself compelled to capitulate with the
savages who surrounded it; and the terms agreed
to by both parties were, that the Indians should
spare the lives of the garrison, who were to have
as much of the arms, ammunition, provisions, &c.
as they could carry away. Captain Wells, who
had come from Fort Wayne to conduct the
garrison
to that place, at night ordered a quantity of
powder and balls to be thrown into the Chicago
river, to prevent its falling into the hands of the
Indians; which, when they discovered in the
morning, so incensed them, that they fired upon the
garrison about a mile from the fort, and a terrible
slaughter ensued. Three women and nine
children
were among the slain; captain Wells had
his breast cut open, and his heart roasted and
eaten
by the chiefs present. Captain Heald, the
commandant of the garrison, and his lady, were
both wounded; the former through both his
thighs, and the latter by a rifle ball in her
wrist, and another through the same arm. Their
lives were saved by Mr. Burnet, a trader, who
was among the Indians: he claimed them as
friends, and offered to purchase their ransom.
Captain Heald and his lady are now at St.
Josephs
,
with Mr. Burnet. There were no British
officers or troops in this engagement.
Fort Harrison, commanded by captain
Taylor
,
was attacked on the night of the fourth
instant
,
by a numerous body of Indians, who
attempted
to make a breach by firing the
block-house
;
but by great exertions the fire was
extinguished
;
and after a severe contest, which lasted
the whole night, the Indians were dispersed, and
relinquished the attack. There is every reason
to believe that the fort has since been relieved,
as a respectable force has been sent for that
purpose. Captain Taylor has been brevetted a
major for his gallant defence of the fort.
Fort Bellevue, on the Mississippi, was also
attacked about the same time, and gallantly and
successfully defended by lieutenants Hamilton
and Vasques.
I will confess that I am not altogether without
apprehensions for the safety of the settlers on
the southern borders of Erie. The English are
at present complete masters of the lake, and the
movements of the savages on the Canadian side
are suspicious, to say the least of them. The
invitations
and lures held out to the Indians on this
side, and the removal into Canada of the
Sandusky
tribe, has excited considerable
apprehensions
,
especially in the citizens of Erie. But I
hope for the best.
My old friend and fellow-soldier, Dearborn,
the hero of your temple-scene at Ellen's
masquerade
,
who, you know, was last winter appointed
a major-general in the army, has actually taken
the field against his old enemies. If the English
still remember Saratoga, the name of Dearborn
will strike a panic in their hearts. I believe his
head-quarters are at Albany.
Our friend Brown, the quaker, has been
promoted
from a colonel to a brigadier-general, and
with about five hundred militia, is entrusted with
the defence of Ogdensburgh, on the St.
Lawrence
.
Harrison, the hero of the Wabash, has been
appointed a major-general, and, as I have before
mentioned, has taken the command of the
Northwestern
army. By the last accounts from the
westward, he was proceeding rapidly towards
Fort Wayne, which was said to be besieged by
the Indians; and vast numbers of volunteers
were marching from different parts to reinforce
himso that it may be fairly calculated, that in
a short time he will have ten thousand men under
his command; men who are thirsting to redeem
the tarnished honor of the American arms. If
our western troops are properly furnished with
provisions and the munitions of war, you may
soon expect to hear of the American standard
being
again reared in Upper Canada, by a force
which shall bear down all opposition.
General Bloomfield has a considerable force
at Plattsburgh, on our northern frontier; and the
continual marching of troops to reinforce him,
seem to indicate an intention of making a
descent
upon Canada from that quarter.
The unfortunate inhabitants of Richmond
have been again visited with a distressing
calamity
.
On Wednesday, the sixteenth instant, the
powder-mills were blown up with a most terrible
explosion, and the mangled remains of fifteen
unfortunate
beings, employed in the buildings, were
scattered in almost every directionlegs broken,
sculls fractured, carcases almost cut in two,
arms torn off, were scattered about in horrible
profusion. One corpse was thrown a hundred
yards, into the trunk of a tree; an arm and hand
driven three or four hundred yards from the scene
of wo.
While these events have been taking place
on land, others of not less interest have occurred
on the turbulent domains of Neptune.
On the twenty-third of June last, two days
after leaving port, commodore Rodgers, in the
frigate
President, had a running fight with the
English
frigate Belvidere. In this affair, which
lasted
more than three hours, the Belvidere had two
men killed, and twenty-two wounded, but finally
escaped after lightening, by throwing overboard
her boats, casks, spars, and, it is believed, some
of her guns.
The President received a considerable
number
of shot in her sails and rigging, but was not
materially injured. The chase was continued
till midnight, when it was relinquished as
hopeless
,
and the President hove to for the squadron
to come up. Early in the chase, one of the
President's
chase-guns, on that side for a
considerable
time. The President had three killed and
nineteen wounded, most of the latter slightly; of
the wounded, sixteen were by the bursting of the
gun. It was by the same gun commodore
Rodgers
had his leg fractured, but has recovered.
While I am on this subject, I cannot refrain
from mentioning an instance of juvenile heroism
in a young midshipman on board the President;
who, though scarcely thirteen years of age,
conducted
himself, through the whole of this affair,
like a veteran hero. A twenty-four pound shot
from the Belvidere wounded him in the left hip,
carried away his pistols and dirk, broke three of
his ribs, and so shattered his arm as to render
immediate
amputation necessary; the whole of
which he bore with the calmness of a stoic. The
same shot killed three men, and wounded two
others. Eight days afterwards a sail was
descried
,
supposed to be an enemy; when,
notwithstanding
the severity of the youngster's wounds,
he flew upon deck, and reported himself fit for
duty, requesting that his name might be struck
from the doctor's books; which request,
however
,
was not complied with. His name is
Nathaniel
Lawrence Montgomery
, cousin to
captain James Lawrence, of the Hornet, and son
of Dr. Thomas W. Montgomery, a physician of
high standing in the city of New-York, who has
three sons, all in the navy. What patriot would
not be a father? One of his sons is a surgeon on
board the Essex, captain Porter: and this
reminds
me of another event, which is the last I
will trouble you with at this time.
On the thirteenth of August, his Britannic
majesty's sloop of war Alert commenced an
action
with the Essex, and in eight minutes struck
her colors, with seven feet water in her hold,
and much cut to pieces, with three men wounded.
The Dey of Algiers has declared war against
the United States; and here I close my budget of
news. If its perusal will tend to lighten in the
least the weight of the captive's chain, I shall
think that the hour I have been writing has not
been mispent. Heaven bless you, and restore
you speedily to your country and friends.
Farewell
.
