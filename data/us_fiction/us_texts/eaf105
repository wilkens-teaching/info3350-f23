A 2
THE
BOARDING SCHOOL, &c.
On
the delightful margin of the
Merrimac
,
in one of the
most
pleasant
and beautiful
situations
, which that fertile and healthful part
of America affords, lived Mrs. Williams, the
virtuous
relict of a
respectable
clergyman.
She had two daughters, lovely and
promising
as ever parent could
boast
.
Mrs. Williams's
circumstances
were
easy
. She
possessed
a little patrimony, to which
she
retired,
after her
husband
's
decease
; but a
desire
of
preserving
this for her children, and a
wish
to
promote
their advantage and enlarge their
society
,
induced her to open a Boarding School.
As
she
had an eye, no
less
to the
social
pleasure
, than to the pecuniary profit of the
undertaking,
she
admitted only
seven
, at a time,
to the privilege of her tuition.
These
were all young ladies, who had
previously
received the
first
rudiments of learning,
and been initiated into the polite
accomplishments
,
which
embellish
virtue and
soften
the
cares of human life. They had generally lived
in the metropolis, and had acquired the graces
of a
fashionable
deportment; but they
prossessed
different tempers and
dispositions
, which had
been
variously
, and, in
some
respects
,
erroneously
managed.
To cultivate the expanding flowers, and to
prune the juvenile eccentricities, which were
diffeminated among
these
tender plants; or, to
speak
without a figure, to extend and purify
their ideas, to elevate and refine their affections,
to govern and direct their
passions
, required an
eye, watchful, and a hand,
skilful
as
those
of the
judicious Mrs. Williams.
While her judgment and prudence aided the
useful
acquisitions
of the mind, a
sprightly
fancy
and a cheerful
disposition
, regulated by
experience
and
discretion
, qualified her to enter, at
once, with becoming dignity and
condescending
ease
, into all their concerns; to participate their
pleasures
; while, with candour and
mildness
,
she
reproved their errors, detected their follies,
and facilitated their amendment.
As the young ladies had
finished
their
school
education, before Mrs. Williams received them
to her
mansion
, her
instructions
were more
especially
designed
to
polish
the mental part, to
call forth the dormant virtues, to unite and
arrange
the charms of
person
and mind, to
inspire
a due
sense
of decorum and propriety, and to
instil
such
principles of piety, morality,
benevolence
,
prudence and economy, as might be
useful
through life.
Their time was, accordingly,
disposed
in a
manner
most
conducive to the attainment of
these
objects. Every part of it was employed
to
some
valuable
purpose
; for
idleness
, Mrs.
Williams
observed
, is the
rust
of the mind.
Whatever tended to enlarge, inform, improve,
or
amuse
,
she
supposed
worthy their attention.
She particularly endeavoured to
domesticate
them; to turn their thoughts to the beneficial
and
necessary
qualifications of private life; often
inculcating, that
Nothing lovelier can be found in woman,
Than to
study
household
good;
and labouring to convince them of the utter
insignificance
and
uselessness
of that part of the
sex
, who are
Bred only and completed to the
taste
Of
lustful
appetence; to
sing
, to dance,
To
dress
, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye.
Early
rising
she
recommended, both by precept
and example. This,
she
said
, would not only
promote their health, but render them
mistresses
of many hours, which
must
otherwise
be
lost
in
enervating
sloth
and inaction. And
should
we,
continued
she
, who have
so
much
cause
for
exertion
,
thus
sacrifice
the
best
part of our time?
Falfely luxurious, will not man awake,
And,
starting
from the bed of
sloth
, enjoy
The cool, the fragrant, and the
silent
hour,
To meditation due, and
sacred
song
?
And is there aught in
sleep
can charm the wife?
To lie in dead oblivion,
losing
half
The fleeting moments of too
short
a life?
Total extinction of th' enlighten'd
soul
!
Or
else
to
feverish
vanity alive,
Wilder'd and
tossing
through
distemper
'd dreams?
Who would in
such
a gloomy
state
remain,
Longer than nature craves; when every
muse
,
And every blooming
pleasure
wait without,
To
bless
the wildly devious morning walk?
Another laudable practice of Mrs. Williams,
was perfect regularity in the government of her
pupils, and in the arrangement of their daily
exercises
. When,
said
she
, we
observe
the
order of the natural world, and admire the
consistency
and harmony of every part, we may
hence derive a
lesson
, for the regulation of our
conduct, in the
sphere
assigned
to us.
Pursuant
to this plan of operation, the young
ladies
arose
at five; from which they had two
hours at their own
disposal
, till the bell
summoned
them at
seven
, to the hall, where, the
ceremonies of the morning
salutation
over, they
breakfasted
together; their
repast
being
seasoned
with the
unrestrained
effusions
of good humour
and
sociability
. On
these
occasions
, Mrs.
Williams
suspended
the authority of the matron,
that, by
accustoming
her pupils to familiarity in
her
presence
, they might be free from
restraint
;
and, feeling perfectly
easy
and unawed, appear
in their genuine characters. By this mean
she
had an opportunity of
observing
any indecorum
of behaviour, or wrong bias; which
she
kept in
mind, till a proper time to mention, and
remonstrate
against
it; a method, the
salutary
effects
of which were
visible
in the daily improvement
of her pupils.
The
breakfast
table removed, each took her
needle-work, except one, who read
some
amusing
and
instructive
book, for the benefit and
entertainment
of the
rest
. The
subject
was
selected
by Mrs. Williams, who conferred the
reading upon them in rotation.
At twelve o'clock, they were
dismissed
till
one, when dinner again called them together,
which was conducted in the
same
manner as
the morning
repast
.
Having
resumed
their occupations, the
reader
of the day produced
some
piece of her own
composition
, either in
prose
, or
verse
, according
to her inclination, as a
specimen
of her genius
and improvement. This being
submitted
to Mrs.
Williams's
inspection
, and the candid
perusal
and
criticism
of her companions; and the
subject
canvassed
with great freedom of opinion, they
withdrew from the
tasks
of the day to
seek
that
relaxation and
amusement
, which each
preferred
.
No innocent gratification was denied them.
The
sprightly
dance, the
sentimental
song
, and
indeed every
species
of
pastime
,
consistent
with
the decorum of the
sex
, was encouraged, as
tending to health,
cheerfulness
, and alacrity.
In
these
pleasing
pursuits
and enjoyments, the
present
class
of happy companions had nearly
completed the term allotted them by their
parents
,
and were
soon
to leave the peaceful
shades
in which they delighted, when, being
assembled
on the Monday morning of their
last
week, their
revered
Preceptress
thus
accosted
them:
As the period is approaching, my dear
pupils
,
when I
must
resign
your
society
, and quit
the important charge of
instructor
and friend,
which I have
sustained
with
so
much
pleasure
,
and, I
trust
, with
some
degree of fidelity, I
shall
sum
up the
counsels
, admonitions, and advice,
which I have frequently inculcated, and
endeavour
to
impress
them on your minds, as my
valedictory
address
. For this
purpose
, during this
last
week of your
residence
with me, I
shall
dispense
with your
usual
exercises
, and
substitute
a collection of my own
sentiments
, enforced by
the pathos of the
occasion
.
Your docility, and cheerful diligence in
attending
to my
instructions
; your
modest
,
affectionate
,
and
respectful
behaviour, together with
the laudable
progress
you have made in every
branch, which you have
pursued
, have well
rewarded
my care, and engaged my approbation
and love. To me, therefore, a
separation
will
be painful. To you the period is important.
It is a period, which, while it relieves you from
the confinement of
scholastic
rules, introduces
you to new
scenes
of cares, of
pleasures
, of
trials
,
and of temptations, which will call for the
exercise
of every virtue, and afford opportunity
for improving the endowments, both natural and
acquired, which you
possess
. Think not, then,
that your emancipation from
schools
, gives you
liberty to neglect the advantages which you have
received from them. The obligations under
which you are laid to your parents for the
education
they have given you, require a diligent
improvement of every talent committed to your
trust
.
Of needle-work you are complete
mistresses
,
from the
most
delicate and highly
finished
, to
the
most
ordinary, though perhaps not
less
useful
,
economy of mending and making the
coarser
garments of family
use
. Many, I am aware,
suppose
this laft
a
species
of learning, which is
beneath the attention of a lady: but Clara will
tell you how valuable it has proved to her; and
how valuable it
may
prove to you.
Nursed
in the lap of affluence, and
accustomed
to unbounded
expense
, Clara little thought, at
your age, that
she
should
ever depend on her
needle for the livelihood and decent appearance
of a
rising
family. A
discreet
and prudent
mother
early inculcated the
lessons
of
industry
and
economy, which
she
now practices; and taught
her that the knowledge could be of no
disservice
,
though
she
never had
occasion
for it. She
married
with the
brightest
prospects
. But a
series
of unavoidable
disasters
,
such
as no human
wisdom
could
foresee
or prevent, reduced her to
narrow
circumstances
; and, to complete her
misfortune,
she
was left a widow with four
small
children. Her parents were in the grave; her
patrimony was gone! In this exigence, what
was her
resource
? Not
fruitless
lamentations,
and unavailing complaints. She immediately
summoned
her
resolution
; and by the
use
of her
needle has ever
since
supported
herself
and family
with decency, and been highly
respected
for her
prudent exertions and exemplary
industry
.
Directly
the
reverse
of this amiable character is
that of Belinda. She was educated in the
same
way with Clara; the
same
schools
gave them
tuition
;
and
similar
prosspects
awaited their entrance
into life. Calamities attended the
progress
of
each; but different as their tempers and
disposttions
B
was their conduct under them. The
falling
fortunes of Clara were awhile
suspended
by
her
discretion
and frugality; while the ruin of
Belinda was
hastened
by her extravagance,
diffipation
,
and
idleness
. View them, now, in their
reduced
state
!
Neatness
,
cheerfulness
, and
activity
preside
in the dwelling of Clara;
negligence
,
peevishness
, and
sloth
are legibly
stamped
on that of Belinda. The ear is pained by her
complaints of poverty; the eye is
disgusted
by
her
slatternly
appearance, and oftentatious
display
of the tattered remnants of finery, which
bespeak
the pride and indolence of their owner; who
will neither convert them into more comfortable
garments, nor, by repairing, render them
becoming
.
I hope, however, that
occasions
like
these
may never call for your exertions. But there may
be
cases
, when, to know the
use
of your needles
will
answer
important
purposes
, even in an
exalted
station
, and
amidst
the
splendor
of
affluence
and plenty.
Matilda dignified a princely fortune by the
exercise
of every virtue which can adorn a lady.
Among
these
, charity
shone
conspicuous
. Her
maid
said
to her, one day, Madam, would you
have me lay
aside
these
cast
-clothes for
some
poor
person
? Yes, replied Matilda; but
sit
down,
and mend them
first
. Don't you
see
they need it?
Why, Madam, rejoined the girl, is it not enough
for you to give them away? I
should
think the
least
they can do is to mend them for
themselves
!
In that
case
,
said
Matilda, my bounty
would be greatly
diminished
. People, who need
charity have not the
necessary
materials for
putting
such
articles into repair; and
should
I
furnish
them, perhaps they have never been taught
to
use
their needles. No more have I, returned
the maid. Have you not?
said
Matilda. Well
then,
sit
down, and I will direct your ingenuity
upon
these
clothes. By this mean you may learn
a very
useful
lesson
, I
assure
you; a
lesson
, which
by
practising
for
yourself
, will enable you to lay
up part of your wages
against
the time when
sickness
or old age
shall
take you from your
labours.
Such examples of
condescension
and
benevolence
to inferiors, are of more real and
lasting
use
than pounds prodigally
bestowed
.
Do you
seek
higher
testimonies
of the honor
and utility of this employment? You may
collect
many from the
histories
which you have
read during the
last
year. Among the Romans,
and
several
other nations of antiquity, a
scarf
,
wrought by the needle of a favourite fair, was
received
as an honorable token of
respect
, and
improved
as an invincible
stimulus
to heroic deeds.
Ladies of the
first
rank and
station
considered
it
as no derogation from the dignity or delicacy
of their character, to make their own apparel,
and that of their families. The virtuous
Panthea
,
when her
husband
was going to fight in
the
cause
of Cyrus, her generous deliverer,
magnificently adorned his
person
, and decorated
his armour with her own needle-work.
We ought never to be idle. No moment
should
be unoccupied. Some employment,
salutary
,
either to body or mind, or both,
should
be
constantly
pursued
; and the needle is
always
at hand to
supply
the want of other
avocations
.
The
listless
vacuity, which
some
young
ladies indulge, renders them extremely unhappy,
though they are
insensible
of the
cause
, and
seek
to beguile the time in frivolous
amusements
.
A
still
more endearing motive remains to be
suggested
; and that is the
pleasure
, which your
accomplishments
in this ornamental and
useful
art
must
afford your parents; and the pain,
which your neglect of it hereafter
must
occasion
them.
But your faithful and affiduous improvement
of time,
since
you have been with me, is a
sure
pledge of your
perseverance
in the path of duty,
and your
progress
in every virtue. I
trust
,
therefore
,
that what I have
said
will be engraved on
your memories; and that
some
useful
ideas will
be
selected
by each of you for your future
advantage
.
Your minds are a good
soil
; and may I not
flatter
myself
, that the
seeds
of
instruction
which
I have
sown
, will
spring
up, and yield fruit
abundantly?
With one voice, they
most
affectionately
assured
Mrs. Williams, that it
should
be their daily
study
to profit by her
lessons
; and withdrew.
B 2
Monday, P. M.
READING.
Being
assembled
, this afternoon, Mrs.
Williams thus
resumed
her
discourse
.
Reading is
so
common a part of education,
that the value of it is not duly
estimated
; nor
the manner of performing it,
sufficiently
attended
to. It is not the mere propriety of
pronunciation
,
accent, and cadence, which
constitutes
good reading. You
must
enter into the
spirit
of
the
subject
, and feel
interested
in the matter,
before
you can profit by the
exercise
.
But you are
so
well acquainted with the
manner of reading, that the quality of books
most
worthy of your
perusal
is the only point
on which I need to enlarge.
Romances, the
taste
of former times, are now
so
far out of vogue, that it is hardly
necessary
to warn you
against
them. They exhibit the
spirit
of chivalry, knight-errantry, and
extravagant
folly, which prevailed in the age they
depict
.
But they are not
interesting
; nor can they
be
pleasing
to the correct
taste
and refined
delicacy
of the
present
day.
Novels are the favourite, and the
most
dangerous
kind of reading, now adopted by the
generality
of young ladies. I
say
dangerous,
because
the influence, which, with very few
exceptions
,
they
must
have upon the
passions
of
youth, bears an unfavourable
aspect
on their
purity
and virtue. The
style
in which they are
written is commonly captivating; and the
luxurlance
of the
descriptions
with which they
abound, extremely agreeable to the
sprightly
fancy
,
and high expectations of the inexperienced
and unreflecting. Their romantic pictures of
love, beauty, and magnificence, fill the
imagination
with ideas which lead to impure
desires
, a
vanity of exterior charms, and a
fondness
for
show
and
dissipation
, by no means
consistent
with that
simplicity
,
modesty
, and
chastity
,
which
should
be the
constant
inmates of the
female
breast
. They often pervert the
judgment
,
mislead
the affections, and blind the
understanding
.
A melancholy example of this
sort
is
exhibited
in Juliana. Juliana was the only daughter
of a wealthy merchant, who grudged no
expense
which could
please
or
embellish
his
darling
child. He, however,
possessed
neither
leisure
nor abilities to teach the young idea how
to
shoot
; but thought it
sufficient
that he gave
her every advantage, which could be derived
from the various
schools
, to which
she
was
consigned
.
She had a brilliant fancy, and a
fondness
for books, which, properly directed, might
have proved of great
use
to her. But, having
no better principles
instilled
into her mind,
she
indulged
herself
in the unlimited reading of
novels, and every light publication which a
circulating
library could
furnish
.
Hence her imagination took wing, and
carried
her far above the
scenes
of common life.
The
excessive
refinement of her mind admitted
no ordinary
amusements
or avocations. Plain
truth from her own
sex
was an
insult
; and from
the other, nothing
less
than adoration would
fatisfy her unbounded vanity. Her beauty (of
which
she
really had a
considerable
share
) and
the large fortune which
she
would probably
inherit
,
gained her many admirers;
some
of whom
were men of
unquestionable
merit. But a
sober
,
rational
courtship
could not
answer
her ideas of
love and gallantry The
swain
, who would not
die for her,
she
deemed unworthy of notice.
Her father
strongly
recommended a
gentleman
,
as well calculated, in his opinion, to make
her happy, and as having his entire approbation;
but
she
rejected him with
disdain
, though
she
could produce no one objection
against
his
person
,
or character.
Her father
acquiesced
;
expressing
, however,
his regret at the
mistaken
notions
she
had
imbibed
;
and warning her
most
pathetically
against
the indulgence of
so
romantic a
disposition
; yet
all in vain. He was
considered
as an illiterate
plodder after wealth, which
she
had a right to
bestow
as
she
pleased
.
At
last
the lovely youth whom
she
had
so
long contemplated, made his appearance. A
military
captain entered the town on the recruiting
service
. Young,
handsome
,
easy
, bold and
assuming
;
with all the
bon ton
of the coxcomb, and
all the
insolence
of the novice. He
saw
Juliana
;
he
sacrificed
to her charms, and
conquered
.
She could not
resist
the allurements of his
gallantry. His affectation of dying love was
received with apparent
pleasure
; while art and
duplicity took advantage of her
weakness
, to
precipitate
her into engagements to pity and relieve
him. Her friends
saw
her danger, and
warmly
remonstrated
against
her imprudent conduct,
in receiving the
addresses
of a man,
destitute
of
property to
support
her, and void of every kind
of
personal
merit. Her father entreated and
implored
the rejection of her lover, till, finding
every other method vain, he at length
resolutely
forbade him the
house
, and his daughter's
company. This was viewed as
persecution
;
and,
consistently
with her
sentiments
of
adventurous
love, a
clandestine
amour was
commenced
.
Her father
surprised
them together; and,
enraged at their
disgraceful
intrigue,
seized
the
captain, and endeavoured to turn him out of doors.
He violently
resented
this ungentlemanlike
treatment
,
as he termed it, and defended
himself
with his
sword
. The old gentleman received a
slight
wound, in the
scuffle
; but
accomplished
his
purpose
. Juliana was terrified at this
rencounter
,
and, dreading her father's
displeasure
,
ran out with her paramour. His lodgings were
near, and thither, favoured by the
darkness
of
the night, he
instantly
led her. She
involuntarily
followed him, without
considering
the
impropriety
of her conduct. Here he drew his
sword
, and, throwing
himself
at her feet,
professed
his
despair
, and declared
himself
resolved
to put an immediate end to his life. She
endeavoured
to
reason
him into
calmness
; but in
vain. He was
sensible
, that, if he now
relinquished
her to her father, he
should
lose
her
forever. His apparent agony overcame her, and
she
gave him her hand.
Her father was
almost
distracted
at her
elopement
.
He traced her
steps
, and, following her
to the
house
,
condescended
to
soothe
her with
parental
kindness
; and
promised
her pardon and
continued affection, if
she
would renounce her
worthless
lover, and return. She
confessed
it
was too late; that
she
was his wife.
Petrified with
astonishment
, he looked at her,
for
some
time, with
speechless
grief; and,
showing
his arm, bound up with the wound he had
received, left her with every token of
anguish
and indignation!
When the fever of
passion
had abated, a
returning
sense
of duty in Juliana, and, in the
captain
,
the fear of
losing
the property which
hesought
,
induced them to
seek
a reconciliation,
and make
submissive
efforts to obtain it. But
her father was too highly
incensed
to grant it
to him, on any terms; or to her, on any other
than the utter rejection of her unworthy
companion
.
These
terms were not complied with.
Sorrow and vexation preyed
so
deeply upon
the mind of this afflicted parent, that they
brought on a rapid decline; and he died without
again
seeing
his undutiful and ruined daughter.
His
estate
was divided between Juliana and her
four brothers. Her portion was received by her
husband
, and
soon
spent
in
dissipation
and
excess
.
Having rioted on the fortune of his wife,
while
she
often pined at home for want of the
common
necessaries
of life, he left her, to join his
regiment,
promising
remittances from time to
time, for her
support
. This
promise
, however, was
but ill performed; and
she
now feels the
dreadful
effects of her folly, in the accumulated ills
of poverty and neglect. Yet
she
still
cherishes
the
most
passionate
fondness
for what has proved
her bane. A friend called to
see
her, not long
since
, and found her the emblem of
wretchedness
and
sloth
. Her emaciated form, her
squalid
appearance, the
disorder
of her
house
, and
her tattered raiment,
bespoke
the
shameful
negligence
of the owner. Yet
she
was
sitting
with a
novel in her hand, over which
she
had
apparently
been weeping. She expatiated largely on the
tale it contained, while her children, who
exhibited
a picture of real woe, engaged not her
attention. Her friend enquired how
she
could be
thus
interested
and
distressed
by mere fiction,
while every thing about her was calculated to
arouse
the
keenest
feelings of her
soul
! She
coolly replied, I have fortitude
sufficient
to
support
my own calamity, but I
must
sympathize
with the heroine of
adversity
. I have not
lost
my
sensibility
with my fortune. My only luxury is
now imagination! How ill-timed, and how
improperly exerted, was this kind of
sensibility
,
in Juliana! Where, and what was her
sensibility
,
when
she
disobeyed
an indulgent parent,
sacrificed
her reputation, and threw
herself
into
the arms of a
worthless
man for protection
from what? from the
kindness
and love of her
best
friends!
But I would not be
understood
to condemn
all novels
indiscriminately
; though great
prudence
is
necessary
to make a
useful
selection
.
Some of them are fraught with
sentiment
;
convey
lessons
for moral improvement; and exhibit
striking
pictures of virtue rewarded; and of vice,
folly, and
indiscretion
punished
; which may
prove encouragements to imitate, or warnings to
avoid
similar
practices. I
shall
not
descend
to
particulars.
Those
, which are
sanctioned
by the
general voice of delicacy and refinement, may be
allowed a reading; yet none
should
engross
your
minds, to the neglect of more important objects;
nor be
suffered
to monopolize too large a portion
of your time.
Novels are a kind of light reading, on which
the imagination
feasts
, while the more
substantial
food which is
requisite
to the
nourishment
of the
understanding
, is either
untasted
or
undigested
.
Imagination is a
sportive
faculty, which
should
be curbed by the reins of prudence and
judgment. Its
sallies
are delightful in youth,
provided they be not too
excursive
.
Poetry is, by
some
, ranked with novels; but
I think
injudiciously
. Good poetry is certainly
a
sublime
source
of entertainment and
instruction
.
What
music
is to the ear, poetry is to the
heart. There
must
indeed, be a natural
taste
for it, before it can be highly
relished
or
enjoyed
;
and this
taste
, wherever it
exists
,
should
be
cultivated. I know of no kind of reading more
richly formed for the mental
repast
of a liberal
and
polished
young lady, than the poetical
productions
of true genius. The trifling and
indelicate
cantos of ordinary witlings, and
everyday
poetasters
, are unworthy your attention.
But the
species
of poetry which I now
recommend
,
C
is peculiarly adapted to
soften
the
passions
,
excite
sympathy
, and meliorate the affections. It
soothes
the jarring cares of life, and, pervading
the
secret
recesses
of the
soul
,
serves
to
rouse
and
animate its dormant powers.
Many
essays
, written by monitors of both
sexes
, are extant, which you may find profitable
and
pleasing
, both in youth and more
advanced
age. Among the
foremost
of
these
, I
mention
Mrs. Chapone's letters to her niece, which
contain a valuable
treasure
of information and
advice.
But among your hours devoted to reading,
history
must
not be without a place. Here an
extensive
field of ages and generations, which
have gone before you, is opened to your view.
Here your
curiosity
may be gratified by a
retrospection
of events, which, by conducting your
thoughts to
remotest
climes and periods,
interests
and enlarges the mind. Here the various
revolutions, the
rise
, fall, and
dismemberment
of ancient kingdoms and
states
may be traced to
the different
springs
of action, in which they
originated. Hence you may gain a competent
acquaintance with human nature in all its
modifications
,
from the
most
rude and barbarous, to
the
most
civilized and
polished
stages
of
society
.
This is a
species
of knowledge, which will
not only be of
constant
use
to you, in the
government
of your own temper and manners, but
highly ornamental in your
intercourse
with the
polite and learned world.
But let your reading of every
description
be
regular and methodical. Never
confuse
your
minds by a variety of
subjects
at once. When
you turn your attention to any one in particular,
finish
, and lay that
aside
, before you take up
another. Let what you read be well
understood
at the time, and well
digested
afterwards.
Possess
yourselves
, at
least
, of the leading traits:
otherwise
your labour will be totally
lost
. If
convenient
,
always recapitulate what you have been
perusing
, and annex to it your own
sentiments
and remarks, to
some
friend. If you have no
friend at hand, who will be
disposed
to hear,
recollect, and run it over in your own thoughts.
This will be a great
assistance
to memory. But
whatever be the kind of reading which you
undertake
,
select
such
authors as good judges
esteem
the
best
, upon the
subject
. Have a
particular
regard to the morality and delicacy of the
books you
peruse
.
When you read for mere
amusement
, (which
should
seldom
happen) be careful not to corrupt
and vitiate your
taste
by frothy and illiberal
performances
,
which will degrade the dignity and
fully the purity of your minds. That time is
very greatly
mispent
, which is
bestowed
in
reading
what can yield no
instruction
. Not a
moment's
attention
should
be given to books which
afford not
some
degree of improvement.
Always
have an eye, therefore, to profit, as well
as to
pleasure
. Remember that youth is the
feed-time of life. You are now to cultivate that
knowledge, which future years
must
ripen. Free
from
those
domestic
cares, which will
engross
and occupy your minds, when placed at the
head of families, a
most
inestimable
price is now
put into your hands to get
wisdom
. Now you
may learn; then you
must
practice.
Now, therefore, lay up in
store
some
provision
for every exigence,
some
embellishment
for every
station
.
Look upon Elvira. Her acquirements in a
single
state
have qualified her for a
shining
pattern
of matronal duties. Her
husband
's
business
abroad prevents him from attending to
domestic
avocations; nor need he be anxious
respecting
the management of his
household
affairs.
Elvira
is
present
to every
occasion
. The
superintendence
of her family, and the education of her
children is her delight. Capable of
instructing
them in every needful branch of
science
, and of
furnishing
them with every
requisite
endowment
,
she
is, at once, their guide, their
example
,
and their friend. When her
husband
returns
from the cares and fatigues of
business
,
with what becoming
ease
and
cheerfulness
does
she
dissipate
the anxiety which
sometimes
hangs
upon his brow, and exhilerate his
spirits
by the
enlivening charms of rational and refined
conversation
!
In the entertainment of their friends,
how
distinguished
a part
she
sustains
! Her
powers
of mind have been
so
happily improved, that
she
is able to
discuss
every
subject
with
ease
and
propriety. To an enlarged
understanding
and a
cultivated
taste
, to an
extensive
knowledge of the
world and an acquaintance with polite literature,
she
superadds
those
amiable virtues, which give
society
its
highest
relish
; while the elegance of
her manners and the
modesty
of her deportment
are a proof of the
greatness
of her mind, and
render her
esteemed
, beloved, and
respected
by
all who know her.
But I
slatter
myself
that each of you, my dear
pupils, will be an Elvira. Then will you do
justice
to the
superior
advantages of your
education
;
be the delight of your friends, and the
ornaments of your country.
Religious
subjects
must
, by no means, be
neglected
in the
course
of your reading. Let the
Bible
be the rule of your faith and practice. If
you
wish
an explanation of any particular
passages
,
seek
it from
some
judicious and pious
friend, or in the writings of
some
judicious and
learned commentator. But always attend
chiefly
to
those
points which
serve
to mend the heart,
rather than to
those
knotty,
metaphysical
disquisitions
,
which tend only to perplex the
understanding
,
and involve the inquirer in
such
labyrinths
C 2
of
abstrusity
, as are above human
comprehension
,
and beyond human concern. The
essential
doctrines and precepts of the
gospel
are
level to every capacity; and upon a life and
conversation
governed by
these
, our hopes, both of
present
peace and future glory,
must
be founded.
He hath
shewed
thee what is good; and what
doth the Lord require of thee, but to do
justly
,
and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy
God?
Tuesday, A. M.
WRITING AND ARITHMETIC.
The
young ladies being
seated
, this
morning
,
their
Preceptress
addressed
them as follows.
Writing is productive both of
pleasure
and
improvement. It is a
source
of entertainment
which enlarges the mental powers more, perhaps,
than any other. The mind is obliged to
exertion
for materials to
supply
the pen. Hence it
collects new
stores
of knowledge, and is enriched
by its own labours. It imperceptibly
treasures
up the ideas, which the hand
impresses
. An
opportunity is
furnished
of reviewing our
sentiments
before they are
exposed
; and we have the
privilege of correcting or expunging
such
as are
erroneous. For this
purpose
, you will find it a
good method to collect and write your thoughts
upon any
subject
that occurs; for by repeatedly
arranging and
revising
your
expressions
and
opinions, you may daily improve them, and learn
to think and
reason
properly on every
occasion
.
By this mean you may
likewise
provide
yourselves
with a fund of matter for future
use
,
which, without this
assistance
, the memory
would not retain. It will be of great
service
to
note down in your common-place book
such
particulars as you may judge worth
remembering
,
with your own
observations
upon them.
This will be a kind of
amusement
which will
exercise
your thinking powers at the time, and,
by recurring to it afterwards, it may afford you
many
useful
hints.
The frequent
use
of the pen is calculated
to refine and enlarge your
understandings
.
Have you any talent at
composition
? it will be
increased
by cultivation.
Neglect no opportunity, therefore, which your
leisure
affords, of delighting your friends, and
accomplishing
yourselves
by the
exercise
of your
genius in this way.
Thrice
blessed
are we, the happy daughters
of this land of liberty, where the female mind is
unshackled
by the
restraints
of tyrannical
custom
,
which in many other regions confines the
exertions
of genius to the
usurped
powers of lordly
man! Here virtue, merit, and abilities are
properly
estimated
under whatever form they
appear
.
Here the widely extended fields of
literature
court attention; and the American fair are
invited to cull the flowers, and cultivate the
expanding
laurel.
But the
species
of writing, which is open to
every capacity, and ornamental to every
station
,
is the
epistolary
. This, between particular friends,
is highly agreeable and
interesting
. It is a
method
of interchanging
sentiments
, and of enjoying
intercourse
with
those
from whom you are far
removed, which is a happy
substitute
for
personal
conversation
. In a
correspondence
of this
sort
, all affectation, formality, and
bombast
should
be laid
aside
.
Ease
,
frankness
,
simplicity
, and
sincerity
should
be its leading traits. Yet let not your letters be
composed
of mere
sounding
terms, and
verbose
egotism
; but intermix
sentiment
with
expression
,
in
such
a manner as may be improving as well
as
pleasing
. Letters of
friendship
should
conduce
no
less
to the advantage than entertainment
of the
person
addressed
; and mere
cursory
letters
,
of general acquaintance,
must
, at
least
, be
written with propriety and accuracy. The
formation
of the characters, the
spelling
, the
punctuation
,
as well as the
style
and
sense
,
must
be
attended
to.
Never omit noticing the receipt of letters,
unless
you mean to affront the writers. Not to
answer
a letter, without being able to
assign
some
special
reason
for the neglect, is equally
unpardonable
as to keep
silence
when
conversation
is
addressed
to you in
person
.
By habituating
yourselves
to writing, what
may, at
first
, appear a
task
, will become
extremely
pleasant
.
Refuse
not, then, to improve this
part of your education,
especially
by your
frequent
and dutifully affectionate
epistles
to your
parents, when
absent
from them.
Express
your
gratitude for their care, and convince them it has
not been
lost
upon you.
Always employ your pens upon
something
useful
and refined. Let no light or
loose
compositions
occupy your time and thoughts; but
remember that what you utter in this way is in
some
measure
the picture of your hearts.
Virtue
forbid, that this favourite employment
should
be
disgraced
by impurity, indelicacy, or the
communication
of vicious and ignoble
sentiments
!
One of the
sages
of antiquity being
asked
why
he was
so
long in writing his opinion, replied,
I am writing for futurity.
Your characters during life, and even when
you
shall
sleep
in the
dust
, may
rest
on the efforts
of your pens. Beware then how you employ
them. Let not the merit of your attainments in
this noble art be degraded by improper
subjects
for its
exercise
. Suffer not the expectation of
secrecy
to induce you to indulge your pens upon
subjects
, which you would
blush
to have
exposed
.
In this way your characters may be injured,
and your
happiness
destroyed
.
Celia and Cecilia were companions at a
boarding
school
. When
separated
, they commenced
an
epistolary
correspondence
, on which each
valued
herself
. Their former intimacy, which they
termed
friendship
, prompted them to write with
unlimited confidence; and, without the
least
reserve
,
to reveal every dictate of levity and
thoughtless
folly. They imagined
themselves
perfectly
secure
from the
censure
of the critic. Their
education had not taught them, that a virtuous
mind
should
shrink
even from ideal indelicacy.
Celia was courted by Silvander, a young man of
whom
she
was
passionately
fond; but
she
had
art and
resolution
enough to conceal her letters
from his
inspection
, though he often
solicited
a
communication of her
correspondence
. At length
he became impatient for a
perusal
of letters
which appeared
so
pleasing
and
interesting
to the
parties, and
suspicious
that
some
particular
cause
directed their privacy. Influenced by
these
motives
,
Silvander bribed a market-boy, who came
from the village where Cecilia lived, and always
conveyed the letters to and from her, to give them
first
into his hand. How
astonished
was he to
find the
lightness
of mind exemplified in them!
Purity of
sentiment
, delicacy of thought, and
refinement of
taste
were entirely laid
aside
; and
illiberal wit, frothy
jests
, double entendres, and
ridiculous love-tales were
substituted
in their
place. His name was
used
with
so
much
freedom
,
and every
circumstance
relative to his
intercourse
,
and
proposed
connexion with Celia,
was bandied with
such
familiarity, that he was
mortified,
disgusted
, and chagrined, in the
extreme
.
He had the policy, however, to conceal
the
discovery
till he had copied a
considerable
number of Celia's letters, leaving out whatever
had reference to his own affairs. He then
revenged
himself
by
disclosing
his knowledge to
her, avowing his indignation at her
weakness
,
duplicity and folly, and taking an immediate and
final leave. Not content with this, he even
circulated
her letters among his acquaintance. This
fixed the
stamp
of ignominy on the
correspondents
;
and their names and characters were
rendered
as ridiculous as
scandal
and malicious wit
could
desire
.
Celia was
almost
distracted
at the
loss
of her
lover; but when
she
found the method he had
taken to
punish
her
indiscretion
, and that her
reputation was thus materially injured,
she
secluded
herself
, in a great
measure
, from
society
. Her
sensibility
received a wound which could never be
healed; and
she
lived and died in melancholy,
regret, and
obscurity
.
However
censurable
the
unjust
and
ungenerous
conduct of Silvander may be deemed, yet
no adequate
excuse
can be offered for the young
ladies, who
dishonored
their pens and their
talents
by a
most
improper and unbecoming
use
of
both.
Next to writing, arithmetic
usually
claims
attention
.
This is
absolutely
necessary
in every
department, and in every
stage
of life. Even in
youth, the proper arrangement of your
expenses
will conduce greatly to your advantage; and
when placed at the head of families, it will be
very friendly to the order and economy of your
domestic
affairs. But, leaving your matronal
conduct to future admonition, many benefits
result
from keeping regular accounts in a
single
state
. Your parents allow you a certain
sum
for
your own private
use
.
Fashion
and folly are
always
busy
in creating innumerable imaginary
wants, which
must
exceed your finances, if you
do not attend to an exact
adjustment
of your
expenditures
.
For this
purpose
, always calculate
your immediate and
most
necessary
demands.
Let
these
be
first
supplied
, and then, if your
funds be not
exhausted
, more
superfluous
ones
may occupy your thoughts. There is one claim,
however, which
must
not be neglected, and that
is CHARITY. You will, therefore, manage your
expenses
in
such
a manner as to
reserve
some
portion of your income for the
necessitous
.
Should you think your allowance
insufficient
to
admit the children of want to a
share
, let your
benevolence plead for the retrenchment of
some
trifling article which you may
dispense
with,
without much inconvenience; and the
exquisite
pleasure
resulting
from the
bestowment
, will
more than counterbalance the
sacrifice
. In
these
,
and many other particulars, a knowledge of
arithmetic
will enable you to conduct the affairs of
youth with
ease
, advantage, and
usefulness
.
D
And, perhaps, as you advance in years, and are
called to fill more important
stations
, you may
find it of
still
greater utility.
The father of Lucinda was in
easy
circumstances
,
while he could perform the duties and
enjoy the profits of a lucrative
business
. He
was the affectionate parent of a numerous family,
to
whose
education and improvement he attended
with unwearied diligence and
pleasure
; till
repeated
losses
in trade, and
disappointments
in his
worldly expectations
embarrassed
his affairs,
depressed
his
spirits
, and impaired his health. In
the
midst
of
these
difficulties, his amiable and
beloved wife was removed by death. This trial
was greater than he could
support
. He
sunk
under
the affliction, and
lost
his
reason
. Lucinda
was the
eldest
of
six
children, the care of whom,
with the melancholy
task
of attending and
ministering
to the
necessities
of her unhappy father,
devolved
on her. She looked upon the woe-fraught
scence
, and wept. Her heart was
sinking
under
the weight of grief; and hope, the
best
soother
of the unfortunate, had nearly abandoned her.
She
advised
with her friends, who
proposed
to
relieve the family by means of a
subscription
.
Lucinda thanked them for their proffered
kindness
,
and returned to her
disconsolate
habitation.
She deliberated on the projected
measure
; which
she
considered
must
be
slow
, uncertain, and, at
any rate, inadequate to their future exigences.
She could not reconcile
herself
to the idea of her
father's depending on charity for
subsistence
.
Yet what could be done? One
resource
only
remainded;her own exertions. By
these
she
slattered
herself
, that
she
might
save
the family
from
suffering
want, and
discharge
the
obligations
she
owed to her revered parent. Her
education
,
by which, among other branches of
learning
,
she
had been well
instructed
in arithmetic,
(that being her father's favourite
study
) qualified
her for this undertaking. She therefore devoted
herself
to the
business
without delay; examined
her father's accounts, collected whatever
remained
that was valuable;
sold
the
superfluous
moveables
,
and
purchased
a
small
stock
for trade. All
who knew her motives and merit frequented her
shop
, and encouraged her by their
custom
and
kindness
. By this mean, together with her
judicious
management, and engaging behaviour,
she
increased
her
business
to
such
a degree, as to
support
the family with
ease
and reputation.
Her
discreet
and dutiful conduct to her
father
,
soon
restored
him to his
reason
.
When he found how prudently and
affectionately
Lucinda had exerted
herself
in his
behalf
,
he exclaimed, Many daughters have done
virtuously
, but thou
excellest
them all!
He
resumed
his former
business
, and lived to
see
his children all well provided for, and happily
settled
around him.
Tuesday, L. M.
MUSIC AND DANCING.
Her
pupils having taken their places,
Mrs. Williams proceeded.
In
music
and dancing you have made
such
proficiency that your performances
must
be very
pleasing
to your friends, before whom you
occasionally
exhibit.
As dancing is an
accomplishment
merely
external
,
let not the vanity of excellence in it betray
itself
in an air of
conscious
superiority
, when
you
shine
at the ball, and perceive
yourselves
to
have attracted the attention and
applause
of the
gay
assembly
. But in the
midst
of hilarity and
mirth, remember that
modesty
, diffidence,
discretion
,
and humility are
indispensable
appendages of
virtue and decency.
Music
is a talent which nature has
bestowed
,
and which your application has
considerably
improved
.
It has a powerful influence over the
heart; wonderfully
soothes
and humanizes the
passions
, and is a
source
of refined
pleasure
to a
mind capable of
tasting
its charms.
Never
refuse
gratifying your friends by the
exertion of your abilities in performing,
unless
for
some
very
special
reason
. Though I would
not have you vain of your
skill
, and
officiously
forward to
display
it; yet the affectation of
uncommon
modesty
, and ignorance, is truly
ridiculous
.
To plead inability to
exercise
powers,
which you are
conscious
of
possessing
, and for
which you
wish
to be
esteemed
and honored by
others, is
false
delicacy, and will never gain
admission
to the
breast
where that which is genuine
resides
. How perfectly
absurd
it is for a young
lady, who is politely
requested
to entertain a
company with her
musical
talents, to declare them
so
small
that
she
is really
ashamed
to
expose
herself
before
such
good judges; or that
she
has
neglected
playing, or
singing
, for
some
time, and cannot
immediately revive her dormant
skill
; or that
she
has forgotten her tunes, or
songs
; or that
she
has a bad cold, (which none but
herself
perceives
)
and is unable to
sing
; or that
she
is loath
to begin this
amusement
, and
must
insist
upon
some
other lady's
setting
the example; which
other lady has, in her turn, an equal number of
excuses
! Thus the time of the company is
engrossed
,
and their
pleasure
suspended
, till a long
train of arguments, entreaties, and compliments
are run through, and her vanity fully gratified
by-the
most
flattering and importunate
solicitations
.
D 2
Then, clate with pride and
self
importance,
she
condescends
to grant their
request
; not
considering
how far
she
has derogated from her own
merit by the futile artifice
she
has employed; an
artifice unworthy of an ingenuous mind, and
disgraceful
to any lady who has arrived to years of
discretion
.
Let us view this
evasive
manner of
seeking
compliments a little nearer. When a
person
is
known to be
mistress
of this delightful art, what
can be her motive for delaying the gratification
of her friends by its
exercise
, and
refusing
a
compliance with their
wishes
, till their patience
is
exhausted
? I believe that
excuses
, in this
case
,
are very
seldom
sincere
. The youthful mind is
not
insensible
to
praise
, nor indifferent to the
means of obtaining it.
Why then
should
it not be received and
increased
by a ready and obliging compliance? A
desire
to
please
is
usually
attended with
success
;
and for what
reason
should
the power and
disposition
be artifully concealed?
Always
preserve
a
frankness
and
sincerity
in
your actions and
designs
.
These
will add
dignity
to your
condescensions
, and
gracefulness
to
your deportment.
Rise
superior
to
those
little arts which
bespeak
the
finesse
of a
childish
folly, or a narrow mind.
Do honor to this, as well as to every other part
of your education, by acting conformably to the
precepts which have been given you, the
knowledge
which you have acquired, and the
opportunities
with which you may be
furnished
for the
purpose
.
Music
and dancing, though polite and elegant
accomplishments
, are, perhaps, the
most
fascinating
,
and, of
course
, the
most
dangerous of
any that fall under that
description
. When
indulged
to
excess
,
beside
engrossing
much time
which ought to be employed in the execution
of more
necessary
and
useful
designs
, they
sometimes
allure their fond votaries from that purity
and rectitude which are the chief
embellishments
of the female character. They lay the mind open
to many temptations, and, by
nourishing
a
frivolous
vanity, benumb the nobler powers both
of reflection and action.
Levitia was endowed, by the joint influence of
nature and art, with
these
pleasing
charms.
Symmetry
was perfected in her form; and her voice
was melody
itself
. Her parents were not in
affluent
circumstances
; yet their
taste
led them to
distinguish
those
graces and talents in their
daughter, which they
injudiciously
flattered
themselves
might, one day,
raise
her to affluence and
same
. Hence they
spared
no pains nor
expense
,
in their power to
bestow
, to
assist
her
inclination
and gratify her
wishes
. As
she
advanced in
years,
she
affiduously
cultivated and diligently
imimproved
those
endowments which
she
had been
erroneously
encouraged, and oven taught, to
consider
most
valuable. To adorn her
person
,
regulate
her movements, and
practise
her
music
, was
all her care. Nor had
she
a
wish
beyond the
pleasures
,
which
she
fancied they could yield. Her
mind
resembled
a garden, in which the
useful
plants are overrun and choaked by noxious
weeds. Here and there a gaudy flower rears its
brilliant head, and proudly dares to
arrest
the
eye; while the delicate and
useful
lie buried
and concealed in the
surrounding
waste
!
Flattery was
pleasing
to her car, in whatever
form it was
presented
. The gay and licentious
fought her
society
; and vanity with its attendant
train of follies led her imagination far from the
sphere
of life which Providence had
assigned
her.
Her parents
saw
their own
mistake
, and were
alarmed at her's: but, alas! too late were their
endeavours to prevent the
mischiefs
which
impended
.
They could not
supply
her unbounded
wants; and therefore to gratify her ruling
passion
,
she
deemed means of her own invention
indispensable
. Among her admirers was a
foreigner
,
who, failing of
success
in his own
country
,
sought
a
subsistence
in ours, from the
stage
.
He knew Levitia's talents.
These
might give
her the palm of
applause
, and in his way of
life, render her
conspicuous
. This plan he
communicated to her,
infidiously
offering to
become
her guardian, and to put her under the
protection of
such
friends as
should
defend her
honor, and
ensure
her
success
. She was
pleased
with the project. Wholly unacquainted with
the world, and
unsuspicious
of the
subtle
arts of
the deluding libertine,
she
scrupled
not his
veracity
,
but
listened
to his
insinuating
declarations
of love and
friendship
. She was deceived by
the vanity of appearing where her fancied merit
would meet with the encouragement and reward
it
deserved
; and vainly imagining that her
beauty
might
secure
her elevation and affluence,
she
readily
consented
to the fatal experiment, eloped
from her father's
house
, and became a
professed
actress
.
Her parents were overwhelmed with grief
and anxiety, at the
discovery
; but to no
purpose
were all their exertions to reclaim her. She had
left them, no more to return; left them, too,
with the heart-rending reflection, that they
themselves
had
heedlessly
contributed to her
disgrace
and ruin. But bitter indeed were the fruits of
her
disobedience
and folly!
She made her appearance on the
stage
. She
sung
and danced, for which
she
was
caressed
,
flattered, and paid. A licentious mode of life
quadrating with the levity of her heart,
soon
left
her a prey to
seduction
. Her gaiety and beauty
gained her many votaries, and
she
became a
complete courtezan.
In the
midst
of this career, her mother died
of a broken heart, evidently
occasioned
by her
undutiful and vicious conduct. A
sense
of her
ingratitude to her parents, and her
shameless
manner of life
struck
her mind, not naturally
unfeeling, with
such
force, as to throw her into
a fever which undermined her
constitution
,
deprived
her of her beauty, ruined her voice, and
left her without means of
support
. Her
pretended
lover, finding
she
could no longer be
useful
to him,
perfidiously
abandoned her to
poverty
and
shame
. She returned, like the prodigal,
to her unhappy father, who received, but could
not
assist
her. Her behaviour, with its
consequences
in the death of her mother, had impaired
his health,
depressed
his
spirits
, and rendered
him incapable of providing for
himself
.
She is now
despised
and avoided by all her
former acquaintance, and
must
inevitably
spend
the remainder of her days in
wretchedness
.
Let us turn from this
disgusting
picture, and
behold its
contrast
in the amiable Florella. To
beauty of
person
she
superadds
delicacy,
sensibility
,
and every noble quality of the mind.
Respectful
to her
superiors
, affable, cheerful, and
polite to her equals, and
condescendingly
kind
to her inferiors, Florella is
universally
esteemed
,
beloved, and admired. Of the
pleasing
accomplishments
of
music
and dancing
she
is a
consummate
mistress
. Yet
she
is
superior
to the vain
arts of flattery, while the dignity of
conscious
virtue
raises
her far above the affectation of
false
modesty
and diffidence. To
please
and oblige
those
friends who are
interested
in her
happiness
,
and gratified by her performances, is her delight.
Nor does
she
think it
necessary
, by
seigned
excuses
,
to delay the
pleasure
, which
she
is able to
afford; but willingly enhances that
pleasure
by a
ready and cheerful compliance. This
she
thinks
the
best
return
she
can make for their kind
attention
.
Though delighted with
these
amusements
herself
,
she
,
nevertheless
,
considers
them
as
amusements
only;
and
assiduously
cultivates
the more
solid
branches of her education.
These
,
she
is wont to
say
, may render me
useful
and
happy, when the voice of
music
shall
be brought
low, and when the
sprightly
limbs
shall
become
languid and inactive.
How happy her parents in her filial duty and
affection! How rich the reward of their care
and
expense
in contributing to her improvements!
How happy Florella in their complacency and
love, and in the
consciousness
of
deserving
them!
She was, not long
since
,
addressed
by a
gentleman
,
who was
pleasing
to her fancy; but,
determined never to indulge a
sentiment
of
partiality without the entire approbation of her
parents,
she
referred him to their
decision
.
For particular
reasons
, they
disapproved
of his
suit
. She
acquiesced
without
reserve
, and
immediately
dismissed
him. Who would not rather
be a
resembler
of Florella, than a vain,
imprudent
,
and ruined Levitia?
True, indeed, the acquirements and graces of
Florella are not attainable by every one; but the
virtues of
discretion
,
modesty
, and
kindness
are
within the reach of the
humblest
sphere
, and
the
most
moderate abilities.
Wednesday, A. M.
Miscellaneous Directions
for
the
Government
of the
Temper
and
Manners
.
I shall
now,
said
Mrs. Williams,
endeavour to
sketch
out for you the plan of
conduct, which I think will be
most
conducive
to your honor and
happiness
while in a
single
state
. Hitherto you have been under the
direction
of parents, guardians, and
instructors
, who
have regulated your deportment, and laboured to
give you
just
ideas upon every
subject
and
occasion
.
That period is now over. You are
now launching into life, where you will think
and act more for
yourselves
.
The path of rectitude, my dear young friends,
is narrow and intricate. Temptations lurk
around
to beguile your feet
astray
; and dangers
which appear
insurmountable
will often
arise
to
affright you from the ways of virtue.
But remember that a crown of honor and
happiness
awaits the undeviating
pursuit
of truth
and duty. Let religion be your guide, and
discretion
your handmaid. Thus attended, you
E
will
escape
the
snares
of youth, and
surmount
the perplexing cares of more advanced age. At
your entrance on the
stage
of action, the
allurements
of
pleasure
will
spread
innumerable charms
to court your acceptance. Beware of their
fascinating
wiles; and whatever
course
you adopt, be
sure
it is
such
as will bear the
test
of
examination
and reflection. Let
these
be the criterion
of all your
pursuits
and enjoyments. Make it an
invariable practice to re-trace the actions and
occurrences
of the day, when you retire to
rest
;
to account with your own hearts for the
use
and
improvement of the
past
hours; and rectify
whatever you find
amiss
, by greater vigilance and
caution, in future; to avoid the errors into
which you have fallen, and to
discharge
the
duties
incumbent upon you.
To neglect this, will be a
source
of great
inadvertencies and failings.
To know
yourselves
, in every particular,
must
be your
constant
endeavour. This
knowledge
will lead you to propriety and
consistency
of action. But this knowledge cannot be
obtained
without a thorough and repeated
inspection
of your various
passions
, affections, and
propensities
.
When obtained, however, it will
prevent the ill effects of flattery, by which you
will
doubtless
be endangered, as you advance
into the
scenes
of
fashionable
life. It will
enable
you to
distinguish
flattery from that generous
praise
which is the
effusion
of a feeling heart,
affected by the perception of real merit. A
young lady,
unskilled
in the deceitful arts of a
giddy world, is very apt to be
misled
by the
adulation
which is offered at the
shrine
of vanity.
She is
considered
as a mark for the wit of every
coxcomb, who
wishes
to
display
his gallantry.
Flattery is a dazzling meteor, which
casts
a
delusive
glare before the eye; and which
seduces
the imagination, perverts the judgment, and
silences
the dictates of
sound
reason
. Flattery is,
therefore, the
poison
and bane of the youthful
mind. It renders the receiver blind to
those
defects which
she
ought to
see
and rectify, and
proud of imaginary graces which
she
never yet
possessed
. Self-knowledge, as before
observed
,
will facilitate the detection of this
disguised
adversary
,
by enabling you to
investigate
your real
accomplishments
and merits.
That
praise
which is the
result
of
deserved
approbation from
those
,
whose
good opinion you
wish
to enjoy, is worthy your attention and
grateful
acceptance: but the
fulsome
compliments
and hyperbolical
professions
of unmeaning and
empty pretenders, calculated only to fill the
imagination
with the inflammable air of
self
-conceit
and arrogant pride,
should
be rejected with
disdain
,
and cordially
despised
by every lady of
sense
and
sentiment
, as an
insult
upon her
understanding
,
and an indignity to her
sensibility
.
Let it, therefore, be known to
those
who
court your favour by an oftentatious parade of
admiration and
obsequiousness
, that their
dissimulation
and duplicity are
discovered
, and that
you are
superior
to
such
futility.
In order to
discriminate
between flattery and
merited
praise
, critically examine your own heart
and life. By this mean you will
ascertain
what
is really your due, and what is merely the effect
of this
insidious
art. But let no ideas of your
own endowments, however
just
, elate you with
an opinion of your
superior
powers of
pleasing
.
Be not
ostentatious
of your charms, either
of
person
or mind. Let
modesty
, diffidence, and
propriety regulate you, in regard to each.
Exalted
advantages will render you an object of
envy to the weak minded of your own
sex
, and
of
satire
to the ill-natured part of the other.
Never obtrude even your real graces and
accomplishments
upon the world. The
penetrating
and judicious will
see
and applaud them,
while retiring from the gaze of a misjudging
and
misrepresenting
throng.
Naked in nothing
should
a woman be,
But veil her very wit with
modesty
;
Let man
discover
; let her not
display
;
But yield her charms of mind with
sweet
delay.
Those
who are
solicitous
for beauty
should
remember that the
expression
of the countenance,
in which its very
essence
consists
, depends on the
disposition
of the mind.
What's female beauty, but an air divine,
Thro' which the mind's all gentle graces
shine
?
These
, like the
sun
, irradiate all between;
The body charms,
because
the
soul
is
seen
.
Hence men are often captives of a face,
They know not why; of no peculiar grace.
Some forms, tho' bright, no mortal man can bear;
Some none
resist
, tho' not exceeding fair.
Beauty, my dear girls, is indeed a
desirable
quality. Neither the pen of the
moralist
, nor
the
spleen
of the
satyrist
, nor the envy of
such
as want it, could ever bring it into contempt or
neglect. Yet mere external beauty is
transient
as the meteor, and frail as the bubble, which
floats on the
surface
of the watery element.
Behold the
disconsolate
and
despised
Flirtilla
!
and from her fate learn not to
trust
in the
effects or duration of this adventitious quality.
Early in life, Flirtilla was taught that her
charms were
irresistible
; that
she
might
aspire
to an
absolute
ascendency
over the hearts and
passions
of her votaries. A
superficial
, but
fashionable
education added the allurements of art
to
those
of
person
, and rendered her a
finished
coquette.
Her beauty and the gaiety of her manners
gained her numerous admirers, who
swarmed
around, like the
insect
tribe, eager to
sip
the
E 2
fragrance of the equally fair and fading
rose
.
The
incense
of flattery, in every form, was her
tribute.
Elated by this,
she
gave free
scope
to her
ruling
passions
, the love of
pleasure
and
dissipation
.
Her
best
days were
spent
in the
chase
of
vanity; and
she
culled the flowers of life,
without
considering
, that
substantial
fruit would be
required at a more advanced period, as a
substitute
for the fading
blossoms
of youth. Her
mind was barren of improvement, and
consequently
destitute
of
resources
.
She vainly imagined the triumphs of beauty
to be permanent, till its declared enemy, the
small
-pox, convinced her of the egregious
mistake
.
By this
she
found her empire
suddenly
overturned. The
merciless
disorder
had reduced
her to a level with the generality of her
sex
, in
appearance, and, in enjoyment, far below them.
Her
glass
faithfully
represented
this
insupportable
reduction. Regret and chagrin heightened
the apparent calamity. She was remembered
only as the
contrast
of what
she
once had been.
Her lovers were
disgusted
with the change, and
sought
more
pleasing
objects of attention; while
men of
sentiment
could not find a
similarity
of
disposition
, in her, to induce a connexion.
Her female acquaintance, who had envied
her as a rival, or feared her as a
superior
, now
insulted
her with their pity, or mortified her
by remarks on the
surprising
alteration in her
appearance.
Finding no alleviation from
society
,
she
retired
from the world to
nurse
, in
solitude
, the
vexation and
disappointment
she
experienced.
View her now,
peevish
,
discontented
, and
gloomy! Her ideas of
pleasure
were centered in
that
person
, which is now neglected; in
those
endowments
which have now
forsaken
her forever!
Thought
she
studiously
shuns
; for
she
has
nothing
pleasing
to occupy her reflections, but
what is irretrievably
lost
!
Miserable
Flirtilla! thou
trustedst
in vanity,
and vanity is thy
recompense
! How happy
mightest
thou have been, even in this change,
if thy heart had been rectified, thy
understanding
improved, and thy mind liberally
stored
with
useful
sentiments
, knowledge, and information!
Cultivate, then, my young friends,
those
dispositions
and attainments, which will yield
permanent and real
satisfaction
, when
sickness
,
adversity
, or age
shall
have robbed your eyes of
their
lustre
, and
diminished
the bloom and
spright-liness
of your forms.
You are
doubtless
sensible
that your
happiness
,
in life, does not depend
so
much on your
external, as your internal graces.
The
constitutional
temper of your minds
was given you by nature; but
reason
is added
for its regulation.
On life's
vast
ocean
diversely
we fail;
Reason
the chart; but
passion
is the gale.
Our
passions
were certainly implanted for
wife and benevolent
purposes
; and, if properly
directed, may be of great utility. This direction
nature will teach, and education improve. To
their precepts we
must
implicitly
listen
, if we
would become
respectable
or contented.
Examine
yourselves
, therefore, with
impartial
scrutiny
. Find out your particular faults in
this
respect
, and exert your unwearied
industry
to amend them.
Possibly
you may be naturally
hasty
,
passionate
,
or vindictive. If
so
, how wretched, at times,
must
the indulgence of this temper render you!
When
reason
, awhile
suspended
,
resumes
its
empire, and calm reflection
succeeds
the riot of
passion
, how
severe
must
be your
self-condemnation
,
and how keen your
sensations
of regret!
Perhaps an
unkindness
of
expression
to
some
particular
friend,
disrespectful
treatment of an
honored
superior
, ill-timed
resentment
to a beloved
equal, or imperious and unbecoming
severity
to
a
deserving
inferior, may give you the
most
painful
emotions, and degrade you in your own, as
well as in the
estimation
of every
observer
! To
prevent this evil,
accustom
yourselves
to check
the
first
risings
of anger, and
suspend
every
expression
of
displeasure
, till you can deliberate
on the provocation, and the propriety of noticing
it. It may have been
undesigned
, and, therefore,
not
justly
provoking. You may have
misunderstood
the word, or action of offence, and
inquiry
may remove the grounds of your
suspicion
:
or the
person
offending may be one with whom
prudence and honor require you not to enter the
lists
. But if neither of
these
considerations
occur
,
reflect a moment, that your own reputation
and
consequent
happiness
are at
stake
; and that
to
lose
the command of
yourselves
and your
passions
is
inconsistent
with the delicacy of ladies,
the moderation of
christians
, and the dignity of
rational beings.
Let every
sally
alarm, and excite you to
rally
and new-
discipline
your forces; and to be
more
strictly
on your guard
against
the
assaults
of your foe.
The character of Camilla is a pattern
worthy
of your imitation. While very young,
Camilla
was unfortunately deprived of the
instruction
and regulating hand of a
discreet
and
judicious mother. Her father was too much
immersed
in
business
to attend to the cultivation
of his daughter's mind.
He gave her the means of a genteel
education
,
praifed her excellencies, and chid her
faults, without being at the pains of teaching
her how to amend them. The irritability of her
temper he rather indulged, confidering her as a
girl of
spirit
, who would make her way in the
world, in
spite
of
obstacles
. She was naturally
generous, tender-hearted, and humane; but her
temper was as uncontrollable as the whirlpool,
and as impetuous as the wind. Happily for her,
she
had an uncommon
strength
of mind, a ready
apprehension
, a quick perception, and a depth
of
understanding
,
seldom
equalled. She
saw
her
errors, was
conscious
of her failings, and a
severe
sufferer
for her faults. But
such
was the
extreme
quickness
of her feelings, and
so
passionate
her
resentment
of any thing which appeared
injurious or affrontive, that
she
could not always
repress
them. She married a gentleman of a
similar
temper, and of equal prudence. In the union
of
such
violent
spirits
, great harmony could not
be
presaged
. Their
passions
were lively, their
affections ardent.
The honey-moon in raptures flew,
A
second
brought its
transports
too;
The third, the fourth, were not
amiss
;
The fifth was
friendship
, mix'd with
bliss
:
But ere a twelvemonth
pass
'd away,
They found each other made of clay.
Inadvertencies gave offence; frequent
altercations
arose
; both were tenacious of their
rights, and
averse
to
condescension
. Camilla
saw
the impending danger;
she
became
sensible
that the
happiness
of her life depended on
amendment and caution;
she
resolved
to avoid
giving or taking offence, with the
greatest
diligence
;
to
suppress
every emotion of anger;
and when
she
thought
herself
injured, to retire,
or be
silent
, till
passion
had
subsided
, and
she
could regain her
calmness
.
This was a hard
task
, at
first
; but
perseverance
rendered it effectual to a thorough
reformation
in each.
Her example and pathetic admonitions
induced
her
husband
to adopt her prudent plan.
They found their mutual endeavours productive
of real
satisfaction
, and
happiness
the reward of
their exertions to
secure
it.
To be vindictive is equally, perhaps more
fatal to our own, and the peace of others, than
to be
passionate
. Violent
passions
of all kinds
are generally
transient
; but revenge is the
offspring
of malice, the parent of
discord
, and the
bane of
social
love. It is an evidence of a weak
and
sickly
mind. True
greatness
will
rise
superior
to this ignoble
spirit
,
so
peculiarly
ungraceful
in a lady, and
inconsistent
with that delicacy
and
sostness
, which ought ever to characterize
the
sex
.
But an envious temper is, of all others, the
most
degrading and
miserable
. Envy is a
malignant
poison
, which rankles in the heart, and
destroys
the inward peace; even while there is
an outward appearance of
serenity
. That mind,
which cannot rejoice in the
happiness
of others,
is capable of very little in
itself
. To look with
a grudging and evil eye on the enjoyments of our
neighbour,
must
be a
source
of perpetual chagrin
and mortification.
Envy indulged, is a
punishment
to its
possessor
.
Eradicate, then, the
first
, and every emotion of
so
corroding and
destructive
a nature; and
endeavour
to excel only by that virtuous emulation,
which is productive of improvement and
respectability
.
A kind,
compassionate
, benevolent, humane
disposition
is an invaluable
treasure
. It will
render
you
blessings
to
society
, and objects of
universal
esteem
.
In
you
'tis graceful to
dissolve
at woe;
With every motion, every word, to wave
Quick o'er the kindling cheek the ready
blush
;
And from the
smallest
violence to
shrink
,
This amiable temper, however, may
sometimes
degenerate into
weakness
.
Prudence
should
be
exercised
, even in the
indulgence of the
most
engaging qualities. In
the
progress
of life,
occasions
may call for that
resolution
and fortitude, which admit not of
apparent
softness
; but
such
occasions
very
seldom
occur.
How alluring are the charms of
sympathy
and
charity! Happy are they who always feel the
one, and have power and inclination to
exemplify
the other!
The diamond, and the ruby's blaze
Dispute
the palm with beauty's queen;
Not beauty's queen demands
such
praise
,
Devoid of virtue, if
she
's
seen
.
But the
soft
tear in pity's eye
Outshines
the diamond's
brightest
beam,
And the
sweet
blush
of
modesty
More beauteous than the ruby's
seen
.

DRESS.
Dress
continued Mrs. Williams to her
re-
assembled
and attentive pupils, is an important
article of female economy. By
some
it is
doubtless
considered
as too
essential
. This is always
the
case
, when it becomes the ruling
passion
, and
every other excellence is made
subordinate
to it.
A
suitable
attention to the etiquette of
appearance
is
necessary
to render us
respectable
in the
eyes of the world; and
discovers
an
accommodating
disposition
, which is, at once, engaging and
useful
in the commerce of
society
. Females are
taxed with being peculiarly attached to, and
captivated
by the glare of
splendor
and
show
. But
I believe
superficial
minds are not confined to
sex
. Whatever form they actuate, to beautify
and adorn it will be the principal object.
A certain
species
of gaiety and
airiness
is
becoming
in youth. Young ladies, therefore, act
perfectly in character, when, under proper
restraint
,
they indulge their
taste
in the
decoration
of their
persons
. But they
should
be
efpecially
careful that their
taste
be correct;
consistent
with the
modest
delicacy which is the
glory
and ornament of woman.
It is laudable to follow
fashions
,
so
far as
they are governed by
these
rules; but whenever
they deviate, quit them with
express
disapprobation
and
disgust
. Any
assumptions
of the
masculine
habit are unbecoming.
Dress
and
manners
should
be
correspondent
; and the engaging
softness
and
artless
simplicity
, which grace my
pupils,
must
be quite
inconsistent
with the air and
attire of the other
sex
.
A gaudy and
fantastical
mode of decoration
is by no means a recommendation. It
bespeaks
a
lightness
of mind and a vanity of
disposition
,
against
which a
discreet
and
modest
girl
should
guard with the
utmost
vigilanoe.
Extravagance
is a great error, even where fortune will
allow the means of
supporting
it. Many are the
claims which the children of affliction and want
have upon the
superfluous
plenty of the rich.
How much better expended would
some
part of
their redundance be, in relieving the
necessities
of
such
, than in decorating their own
persons
, with
every ornament which art can contrive to create
expense
!
Neatness
and propriety
should
be the main
objects; for
loveliness
needs no foreign aid to
give in a
passport
.
Neatness
is too often
connected
with the idea of a
prudish
singularity
; but no
gaudiness
of apparel, no
richness
of attire, no
modishness
of appearance can be an equivalent
for it. Propriety is that garb which becomes our
situation
and
circumstances
in life. There
certainly
ought to be a difference between different
ages and conditions, in this
respect
. Many
articles
,
ornamental to
Miss
in her teens, would
appear
absurd
,
fantastical
, and ridiculous in maturer
years. Neither
should
the matronal robes, and
the
close
cap hide the natural ringlets, and
easy
shapes
of the blooming girl.
It is a very
false
taste
which induces people
in dependent and narrow
circumstances
, to
imitate
the
expensive
mode of
dress
which might be
very decent for
those
who move in a higher
sphere
.
To endeavour to conceal indigence by the
affectation
of extravagance, is committing a great
offence, both
against
ourselves
, and the
community
to which we belong. The means of
support
should
always be attended to. A conformity to
these
will render you more
respected
for prudence,
than a deviation for the
sake
of
show
without
substance
, can make you admired.
Louisa
and Clarinda are
striking
examples.
They were both the daughters of reputable
parents
,
whose
situations
in the world were
easy
and
comfortable, though not affluent. They were
able to give their children a good education, but
no other portion. Gay, volatile, and ambitious,
Louisa
was the votary of
fashion
. A
superior
in
dress
excited the
keenest
sensations
of envy
in her
bosom
; and a rival in appearance gave
her
unspeakable
mortification.
Dissatisfied
with
her natural charms,
cosmetics
and paints added
to her
expenses
, and betrayed her folly. She
had many
professed
admirers, who found her a
willing dupe to flattery, and who
raised
her
vanity by
praising
her excellent
taste
.
Leander, a gentleman of liberal education,
superior
merit, and
handsome
property,
cast
his
eye around for a companion to
share
and enjoy
these
advantages with him.
Louisa
caught his
attention. The elegance of her
person
, and
splendor
of her appearance, charmed his
imagination, and
inspired
the idea of a fortune
sufficient
to
support
her
expensive
style
of living.
He paid his
addresses
, and was received with
the
most
flattering encouragement. But how
great was his
disappointment
, when he
discovered
the
smallness
of her
resources
, and the
imprudence
of her management! This,
said
he to
himself
, will never do for me. Were my income
far
superior
to what it is, it would not be
adequate
to
such
unbounded extravagance.
Besides
,
where
so
little economy is
practised
, while under
parental government, what
must
be the
consequence
of that unlimited indulgence, which the
confidence due to a wife demands? Were I to
abridge her
expenses
, and endeavour to rectify her
fantastical
taste
, it would
doubtless
foment
dissension
,
discord
, and
animosity
, which
must
terminate
F 2
in
wretchedness
. He
resolved
, however,
to try her real
disposition
, by gently hinting his
disapprobation
of her gaiety. This
she
resented
;
and a rupture, which ended in a final
separation
,
ensued
. She found, too late, the value of the
man, whom
she
had
slighted
; and ever after
regretted
that
solly
which had irretrievably
alienated
his affections.
The
modesty
and
neatness
of Clarinda's garb
next caught Leander's eye.
Conversing
with her
on the
subject
of
dress
, the
justness
of her
sentiments
gave him the
highest
ideas of the rectitude
and innocence of her mind. A
costly
article
was offered for her
purchase
; but
she
refuesed
it.
It would not become me,
said
she
, nor any other
person
who has not an affluent fortune. If I had
a
sufficiency
to buy it, I would procure
something
more
simple
and
necessary
for
myself
; and
the overplus might render an object of
distress
contented and happy.
Yet was Clarinda always elegantly neat;
always genteelly
fashionable
. Frugality and
economy
,
free from
profusion
and extravagance,
enabled
her to indulge her own
taste
entirely; and
while
she
enjoyed that,
she
repined not at the
fancied
superiority
of others. Leander found
her all he
wished
, in appearance; all he hoped
for, in reality. As their
tastes
were
correspondent
,
and their
highest
aim, when united, to
please
each other, they were not dependent on the
breath of
fashion
for their
happiness
. A
compliance
with its forms did not elate their pride,
nor a departure from them, fill their hearts with
peevishness
and
discontent
.
Thursday, A. M.
POLLTENESS.
Still
more important than your habit,
is your air and deportment. It is not
sufficient
that
these
are
pleasing
to the eye of the
superficial
observer
. Your behaviour and
conversation
must
be uniformly governed by the laws of
politeness
,
discretion
, and decorum.
Else
you
will be
disgusting
to people of
resinement
; and
the judicious and
discerning
will
discover
the
weakness
of your minds,
notwithstanding
the
showy
ornaments, intended to conceal it from
public view.
Inattention in company is a breach of good
manners. Indeed, it is a downright
insult
; being
neither more nor
less
, than declaring that you
have not the
least
respect
for any who are
present
. Either you do not value their good
opinion, or you have
something
more important
than their
conversation
to occupy your minds.
You
should
always be attentive to
those
with
whom you are
conversant
, let their rank and
standing
be what they may. Your
superiors
will
esteem
you for your
respectful
treatment of
them; your equals will love you for your
kindness
and familiarity; your inferiors will
respect
you for your
condescension
and
meekness
.
Attention in company will be advantageous
to
yourselves
. Like the
industrious
bee, which
sips
honey from every plant, you may derive
some
benefit or
instruction
from all kinds of
society
. Some
useful
remark or information;
some
sentiment
which may allure you to the
practice of virtue, or deter you from a vicious
perpetration, may repay your labour, and be
serviceable
through life.
But
should
there be no other motive than
that of
pleasing
your
associates
, and rendering them
happy, by making
yourselves
agreeable, it may
be confidered as a
sufficient
inducement to the
practice of this branch of good-breeding. Many
girls, in the
thoughtless
levity of their hearts,
divert
themselves
at the
expense
of others; and,
with the
utmost
glee, point out any thing
peculiar
in the appearance, words, or actions of
some
one in the company, whom they
select
for a
subject
of merriment and ridicule. This, by
shrewd
looks, ironical
gestures
, or tittering
whispers
, is
kept up, to the great mortification of the unhappy
victim, and to the reproach and
dishonor
of the
offenders. Such conduct is a breach, not only
of the rules of common civility, but of humanity;
besides
being directly repugnant to the precept
of doing to others as we would that they
should
do to us.
Be particularly careful, then, not to mortify,
or give pain to an inferior.
Let the
question
, who maketh thee to
differ?
suppress
every emotion of ridicule,
contempt
,
or neglect; and induce you to
raise
and
encourage
depressed
merit by your notice and
approbation.
As far as propriety, delicacy, and virtue will
allow, conform to the
taste
, and participate in
the
amusements
and
conversation
of the company
into which you have fallen. If they be
disagreeble
to you, avoid a
supercilious
avowal of your
dislike
. This,
instead
of reforming, would
probably
give them a
disgust
to you, and perhaps
subject
you to affronts. Yet where a
disapprobating
word or hint may be
seasonable
, neglect
not the opportunity of contributing to their
benefit
and amendment.
Are you
conscious
of
superior
advantages,
either mental or external, make no
ostentatious
display
of them. Vanity too often leads young
ladies to obtrude their acquirements on the eyes
of
observers
,
inconsiderately
apprehending they
may
otherwise
be unnoticed. Such
forwardness
always
subjects
them to
censure
, ridicule, and
envy; the
expressions
of which
destroy
that
self
-approbation which retiring merit invariably
enjoys. However, exert that dignity of virtue
which will render you independent of caprice,
calumny, and unprovoked
satire
.
Make no ungenerous, or ill-natured remarks
on the company, or on the individuals of which
it is
composed
.
If you
dislike
them, avoid them in future.
If you
witness
errors, faults, or improprieties,
conceal, or at
least
extenuate them, as much as
possible
.
Make
just
allowances for
those
who may
differ from you in opinion; and be cautious
never to
misrepresent
, or circulate what appears
amiss
to you, and
must
, if
exposed
, be injurious
to others. Charity hides a multitude of faults.
Certainly then, charity will never aggravate nor
create them.
To give currency to a report, which tends
to the
disadvantage
and
dishonor
of another, is
defaming; and defamation is a
species
of
cruelty
,
which can never be expiated.
Of this the unhappy, though imprudent
Eudocia
,
is an exemplification.
Eudocia was young, gay, and charming. A
levity of
disposition
, which the innocence of her
heart attempted not to
restrain
,
sometimes
gave
the tongue of
slander
pretence to aim its
envenomed
shafts
at her character, and to
misrepresent
her
sprightliness
.
Independent in fortune;
still
more
so
in
mind, calumny gave her no pain, while
she
was
conscious
of the rectitude of her intentions.
Leontine was a gentleman of property;
agreeable in his
person
and manners; of
strict
honor, and extremely tenacious of it; but of a
severe
and unforgiving temper. He paid his
addresses
to Eudocia; was accepted, approved,
and beloved. Yet, though he had gained her
affections, he had not
sufficient
influence to
regulate her conduct, and
repress
her gaiety.
Her
fondness
for
show
and gallantry, in
some
instances
,
induced her to countenance the
attentions
,
and receive the flattery, of men,
whose
characters were exceptionable, in Leontine's
estimation
.
He
remonstrated
against
her
imprudence
,
and gave her his ideas of female delicacy.
She laughed at his gravity, and rallied him on
his implicit
subjection
to the opinions of others.
Towards the
close
of a fine day, Eudocia
rambled along a retired road, to enjoy the air.
She was alone; but the hope of meeting her
beloved Leontine, whom
she
expected that
evening
,
imperceptibly led her beyond her intended
excursion
. The rattling of a carriage
caused
her
to
stop
; and, thinking it to be Leontine's,
she
approached
it before
she
perceived her
mistake
. A
gentleman of an elegant appearance alighted,
and
accosting
her politely,
expressed
his
surprise
at finding her
so
far from home without an
attendant
.
She found it was Florio, with whom
she
had a
slight
acquaintance, having once met
with him in company. She frankly owned her
motive for walking thus far; and
refused
his
invitation
to return in his carriage. He renewed
his
request
; and his importunity,
seconded
by
her
satigue
, at
last
prevailed. At this moment
the detracting Lavina
passed
by. She
saw
Eudocia
,
and with a
sneering
smile
,
wished
her a
good night. Eudocia was
unconscious
of fault,
and therefore
fearless
of
censure
. But the
artful
Florio,
desirous
of protracting the
pleasure
of her company, took a circuitous route, which
considerably
increased
the
distance
to her father's
house
. However, he conveyed her
safely
home,
though not
so
soon
as
she
wished
. She found
that Leontine had been there, and had gone
to
visit
a friend; but would
soon
return.
Leontine
was
just
seated
at his friend's, when Lavina
entered.
She told the circle, that Florio had
just
passed
her, and that he had company
she
little
expected to
see
with him. They inquired if it
was his former
mistress
? No,
said
she
, he has
discarded
her
some
time ago, and if we may
judge by appearances, has
chosen
a new one.
Upon being
asked
who,
she
presumed
to name
Eudocia. Every countenance
expressed
surprise
and regret. In Leontine's, rage and
resentment
were
visibly
depicted. He
rose
, and
stepping
hastily
to Lavina, told her he was a party
concerned
,
and demanded an explanation of what
she
had infinuated. She perceived that
she
had
G
given offence, and endeavoured to
excuse
herself
;
but he
resolutely
told her that no
evasions
would avail; that he
insisted
on the real truth of
her
scandalous
report. Finding him thus
determined
,
she
related the
simple
fact of
seeing
Eudocia
in a carriage with Florio, who was a known
libertine, and
accustomed
to the
society
of
loose
women. Leontine
asked
her how
she
came to
associate
the ideas
she
had mentioned with
Eudocia's
name? She replied that the
lightness
of her
behaviour had
sometimes
rendered her
censurable
;
and
she
thought this
instance
, in particular,
authorized
suspicion
. Leontine could not deny that
she
was culpable in appearance; yet made
answer
,
that though
scandal
might
feast
on the
failings of virtue, he believed Eudocia's
innocence
much purer, and her heart much better
than her detracters'; and, taking his hat, he
wished
the company a good evening, and left them.
His
passions
were on fire. He could not
comprehend the
mysterious
conduct of Eudocia.
Her
absence
from home, at a time when he
expected
her to receive him, and her being
seen
at a
distance
, in company with a
professed
debauchee
,
were a labyrinth which he could not
explore
.
Though he doubted not Eudocia's honor,
yet her folly and imprudence, in
subjecting
her
character to
suspicion
and reproach, he thought
unpardonable. His
resentment
determined him
to break the
proposed
connexion immediately;
and, left his love
should
get the better of his
resolution
, he went directly to the
house
.
As he could not command his temper, he
appeared extremely agitated, and angrily told
Eudocia that
she
had
caused
him great
uneasiness
;
and that he came to claim the
satisfaction
of knowing, why
she
had avoided his
society
,
and made an
assignation
with a man who had
involved her in infamy? Eudocia was
astonished
,
and
justly
offended at this
address
. With all
the dignity of
conscious
innocence,
she
replied,
that as yet he had no right to challenge an
account
of her conduct; but for her own
sake
,
she
would
condescend
to give it. This
she
did,
by a faithful and
undisguissed
relation of facts.
She then
asked
him, if he was
satisfied
. He
answered
, No. For,
said
he, though you have
cleared
yourself
of guilt, in my
apprehension
,
you will find it very difficult to free your
character
from the
blemish
it has received in the
opinion of the world. Saying this, he told her,
that, however highly he
esteemed
her,
so
opposite
were their
dispositions
, that they
must
often
be at variance; and
so
nice was his
sense
of
honor, that his wife, like Cfar's,
must
not only
be virtuous, but
unsuspected
. She rejoined, that
his
sentiments
were apparent; and if what he
then
expressed
were his opinion of her, it was
best
they
should
part.
Some further
conversation
passed
; when,
promising
to call, the next day, and
satisfy
her
parents
,
and
wishing
Eudocia all
possible
happiness
in life, he took his leave.
The impropriety of her conduct, and her
losing
the affections of a man
she
too ardently
loved, together with the cruel treatment
she
had
just
received from him, overwhelmed her with
grief, and produced the
most
violent emotions
of regret. She walked her room in all the
anguish
of
disappointed
hope. Her parents
used
every argument to
soothe
and
console
her; but
in vain.
She yielded to their
persuasions
so
far as to
retire to bed; but
rest
she
found not; and the
morning
presented
her in a burning
sever
.
Leontine
called in the
course
of the day; but the
friends of Eudocia
refused
to
see
him. An
account
of her
disorder
had
roused
him to a
sense
of his
rashness
, and he begged to be admitted to
her chamber; but this
she
utterly denied.
Her fever left her; but the
disease
of her
mind was beyond the power of medicine. A
settled
melancholy
still
remains; and
she
lives
the victim of calumniation!
To detract from the merit of others,
beside
the want of
politeness
which it betrays, and
beside
the injuries which it always
occasions
, is
extremely impolitic. It is to
confess
your
inferiority
,
and to acknowledge a
wish
, not to
rise
to
greater
respectability
; but to bring down
those
about you to your own level! Ill-natured
remarks
are the genuine offspring of an envious
and grovelling mind.
Call
yourselves
to a
severe
account, therefore,
whenever you have been guilty of this degrading
offence; and always check the
first
impulses
towards
it.
Accustom
yourselves
to the
exercise
of
sinoerity
,
benevolence, and good-humour,
those
endearing
virtues, which will render you beloved
and
respected
by all.
To
bestow
your attention, in company, upon
trifling
singularities
in the
dress
,
person
, or
manners
of others, is
spending
your time to little
purpose
. From
such
a practice you can derive
neither
pleasure
nor profit; but
must
unavoidably
subject
yourselves
to the imputation of
incivility
and malice.

Thursday, L. M.
AMUSEMENTS.
Amusement
is impatiently
desired
,
and eagerly
sought
by young ladies in general.
Forgetful that the
noblest
entertainment
arises
from a placid and well cultivated mind, too many
fly from
themselves
, from thought and
reflection
to
fashionable
dissipation
, or what they call
pleasure
, as a mean of beguiling the hours
which
solitude
and retirement render
insupportably
tedious.
An extravagant
fondness
for company and
public
resorts
is incompatible with
those
domestic
duties, the faithful
discharge
of which ought
to be the prevailing object of the
sex
. In the
indulgence of this
disposition
, the mind is
enervated
,
and the manners corrupted, till all
relish
for
those
enjoyments, which, being
simple
and
natural, are
best
calculated to promote health,
innocence, and
social
delight, is totally
lost
.
It is by no means
amiss
for youth to
seek
relaxation from
severer
cares and labours, in a
participation of
diversions
,
suited
to their age,
sex
, and
station
in life. But there is great
danger
of their lively imaginations' hurrying them
into
excess
, and detaching their affections from
the ennobling
acquisitions
of moral improvement,
and refined delicacy. Guard, then,
against
those
amusements
which have the
least
tendency to
sully
the purity of your minds.
Loose
and immoral books; company,
whose
manners are licentious, however gay and
fashionable
;
conversation
, which is even tinctured
with
profaneness
or
obscenity
; plays, in which
the
representation
is
immodest
, and
offensive
to
the ear of
chastity
; indeed,
pastimes
of every
description
, from which no advantage can be
derived
,
should
not be countenanced; much
less
,
applauded. Why
should
those
things afford
apparent
satisfaction
in a crowd, which would call
forth the
blush
of indignation in more private
circles? This
question
is worthy the
serious
attention
of
those
ladies, who, at the theatre, can
hardly
restrain
their approbation of
expressions
and actions, which, at their
houses
, would be
intolerably
rude and indecent, in their
most
familiar
friends!
Cards are
so
much the
taste
of the
present
day, that to caution my pupils
against
the too
frequent
use
of them, may be thought
old-fashioned
in the extreme. I believe it, however, to
be a
fascinating
game, which occupies the time,
without yielding any kind of
pleasure
or profit.
As the
satirist
humourously
observes
,
The love of gaming is the
worst
of ills;
With
ceaseless
storms
the blacken'd foul it fills;
Inveighs at Heaven, neglects the ties of blood;
Destroys
the power and will of doing good;
Kills health, pawns honor, plunges in
disgrace
;
And, what is
still
more dreadful
spoils
your face.
One thing at
least
is certain; it entirely
excludes all rational
conversation
. That
delightful
interchange of
sentiment
, which the
social
meeting of friends is calculated to afford, and
from which many advantages might be derived,
is utterly excluded.
Reading, writing, drawing, needle-work,
dancing,
music
, walking, riding, and
conversation
,
are
amusements
well adapted to yield
pleasure
and utility. From either of
these
, within proper
bounds, there is no danger of injury to the
person
,
or mind; though to render even our
diversions
agreeable, they
must
be enjoyed with
moderation
,
and
variously
and prudently conducted.
Such as are peculiarly exhilarating to the
spirits
,
however innocent in
themselves
,
should
be more
cautiously
and
sparingly
indulged.
When once the mind becomes too much
relaxed
by
disspating
pastimes
, it is proportionably
vitiated, and negligent of
those
nice attentions
to the rules of
reserve
and decorum, which ought
never to be
suspended
. Intoxicating is the full
draught of
pleasure
to the youthful mind; and
fatal are the effects of
unrestrained
passions
.
Flavia was the daughter of a gentleman,
whose
political principles obliged him to leave
his country, at the commencement of the
American
revolution. At that time
she
was at
nurse
in a neighbouring village; between which and
the metropolis, all communication being cut off,
he was reduced to the
necessity
of leaving her
to the mercy of
those
to whom
she
was
entrusted
.
Having received her from pecuniary
motives
only, they no
sooner
found
themselves
deprived
of the profits of their labour and care,
than they fought
relies
by an application to the
town for her
support
. A wealthy farmer in
the vicinity, who had often
seen
and been
pleased
with the dawning charms of Flavia, pitied
her condition; and having no children of his
own,
resolved
to
shelter
her from the impending
storm
, till
she
could be better provided for.
At his
house
,
she
was brought up in a homely,
though comfortable manner. The good man
and his wife were
excessively
fond of her, and
gave her every
instruction
and advantage in their
power. Plain truths were liberally inculcated,
and every exertion made to give her a habit of
industry
and good nature. Flavia requited their
kindness
by an obliging and cheerful, a docile
and
submissive
deportment. As
she
advanced in
years,
she
increased
in beauty. Her amiable
disposition
rendered her beloved, and her
personal
accomplishments
made her admired by all the
village
swains
. The approbating
smile
of
Flavia
was the reward of their toils, and the favour
of her hand in the
rustic
dance was
emulously
sought
.
In this
state
, Flavia was happy. Health and
innocence were now her portion; nor had
ambition
as yet taught her to
sigh
for
pleasures
beyond
the reach of her attainment.
But the arrival of her father, who had been
permitted to return, and re-
possess
the
estate
which he had abandoned, put a period to the
simplicity
and peace of Flavia's mind. He
sought
, and found her; and though
sensible
of
his obligations to her
foster
-parents for
snatching
her from want and
distress
,
still
he could
not prevail on
himself
to make
so
great a
sacrifice
to gratitude as they
wished
, by permitting
his daughter to
spend
her days in
obscurity
.
The lively fancy of Flavia was allured by the
splendid
promises
and
descriptions
of her father;
and
she
readily
consented
to leave the friends of
her childhood and youth, and explore the walks
of
sashionable
life.
When
she
arrived in town, what new
scenes
opened upon the dazzled eyes of the admiring,
and admired Flavia!
Wealth, with its attendant train of
splendid
forms and ceremonies, courted her attention, and
every
species
of
dissipating
amusement
,
fanctioned
by the name of
pleasure
, beguiled the hours
and charmed the imagination of the noviciate.
Each enchanting
scene
she
painted to
herself
in
the
brightest
colours; and her inexperienced
heart
promised
her
happiness
without allay.
Flattery gave her a
thousand
charms which
she
was hitherto
inconscious
of
possessing
, and the
obsequiousness
of the gaudy train around
raised
her vanity to the
highest
pitch of arrogance and
pride. Behold Flavia, now, launched into the
whirlpool of
fashionable
folly! Balls, plays,
cards, and parties
engross
every portion of her
time.
Her father
saw
, too late, the imprudence of
his unbounded indulgence; and his egregious
mistake
, in
so
immediately
reversing
her mode
of life, without
first
furnishing
her mind with
sufficient
knowledge and
strength
to repel
temptation
.
He endeavoured to regulate and
restrain
her conduct; but in vain. She complained of
this, as an abridgment of her liberty, and took
advantage of his doating
fondness
to
practise
every
excess
. Involved in
expenses
(of which
losses
at play
composed
a
considerable
part)
beyond
her power to defray, in this
embarrassing
dilemma,
she
was reduced to the
necessity
of
accepting
the treacherous offer of Marius to
advance
money for the
support
of her extravagance.
Obligated by his apparent
kindness
,
she
could
not
refuse
the continuance of his acquaintance,
till his
delusive
arts had obtained the reward he
proposed
to
himself
, in the
sacrifice
of her honor.
At length
she
awoke to a trembling
sense
of her
guilt, and found it fatal to her peace, reputation,
and
happiness
.
Wretched Flavia! no art could conceal thy
shame
! The grief of her mind, her retirement
from company, and the alteration in her
appearance
,
betrayed her to her father's
observation
.
Highly
incensed
at the ingratitude and
baseness
of her conduct, he
refused
to forgive her; but
sent
her from the
ensnaring
pleasures
of the town,
to
languish
out the remainder of life in
solitude
and
obscurity
.
Friday, A. M.
FILIAL AND FRATERNAL
AFFECTION
.
The
filial and fraternal are the
first
duties
of a
single
state
. The obligations you are
under to your parents cannot be
discharged
, but
by a uniform and cheerful obedience; an
unreserved
and ready compliance with their
wishes
,
added to the
most
diligent attention to their
ease
and
happiness
. The virtuous and affectionate
behaviour
of children is the
best
compensation
, in
their power, for that unwearied care and
solicitude
which parents, only, know. Upon
daughters
,
whose
situation
and employments lead them
more frequently into
scenes
of
domestic
tenderness
;
who are often called to
smooth
the pillow
of
sick
and aged parents, and to
administer
with
a
skilful
and delicate hand the cordial,
restorative
to decaying nature, an endearing
sensibility
,
and a dutiful
acquiesence
in the
dispositions
, and
even peculiarities of
those
from whom they have
derived
existence
, are
indispensably
incumbent.
Such a conduct will yield a
satisfaction
of
mind more than equivalent to any little
sacrifices
H
of inclination or humour which may be
required
at your hands.
Pope, among all his admired poetry, has not
six
lines more beautifully
expressive
than the
following:
Me, let the pious office long engage,
To rock the cradle of declining age;
With lenient arts extend a mother's breath,
Make languor
smile
, and
smooth
the bed of death;
Explore the thought, explain the
asking
eye,
And keep awhile one parent from the
sky
!
Next in rank and importance to filial piety, is
fraternal love. This is a natural affection which
you cannot too
assiduously
cultivate. How
delightful
to
see
children of the
same
family dwell
together in unity; promoting each other's
welfare
,
and emulous only to excel in acts of
kindness
and good will. Between brothers and
sisters
the connexion is equally intimate and
endearing
.
There is
such
a union of
interests
, and
such
an undivided participation of enjoyments,
that every
sensible
and feeling mind
must
value
the
blessings
of family
friendship
and peace.
Strive, therefore, my dear pupils, to promote
them, as objects which
deserve
your particular
attention
;
as attainments which will not fail
richly
to reward your labour.
Prudelia,
beside
other amiable endowments
of
person
and mind,
possessed
the
most
lively
sensibility
, and ardent affections.
The recommendations of her parents, united
to her own
wishes
, had induced her to give her
hand to Clodius, a gentleman of
distinguished
merit. He was a foreigner; and his
business
required
his return to his native country.
Prudelia bid a reluctant adieu to her friends,
and embarked with him. She lived in affluence,
and was admired and
caressed
by all that knew
her, while a lovely family was
rising
around her.
Yet
these
pleasing
circumstances
and
prospects
could not
extinguish
or alienate that affection,
which
still
glowed in her
breast
for the natural
guardians and companions of her childhood and
youth.
With the
deepest
affliction
she
heard the
news of her father's death, and the embarraffed
situation
in which he had left his affairs. She
was impatient to
console
her widowed mother,
and to
minister
to her
necessities
. For
these
purposes
,
she
prevailed on her
husband
to
consent
that
she
should
visit
her, though it was
impossible
for him to attend her. With all the
transport
of dutiful zeal,
she
flew to the arms of her
bereaved parent. But how great was her
astonishment
and grief, when told that her only
sister
had been deluded by an affluent villain, and by
his
insidious
arts,
seduced
from her duty, her
honor, and her home! The emotions of pity,
indignation, regret, and affection, overwhelmed
her, at
first
; but recollecting
herself
, and
exerting
all her fortitude,
she
nobly
resolved
, if
possible
,
to
snatch
the guilty, yet beloved Myra, from
ruin, rather than revenge her injured family by
abandoning her to the infamy
she
deferved. To
this intent
she
wrote her a pathetic letter,
lamenting
her elopement, but entreating her,
notwithstanding
,
to return and receive her fraternal
embrace
.
But Myra,
conscious
of her crime, and
unworthiness
of her
sister
's
condescension
and
kindness
, and above all, dreading the
superiority
of her virtue,
refused
the generous invitation.
Prudelia was not thus to be
vanquished
in her
benevolent undertaking. She even followed her
to her lodgings, and
insisted
on an interview.
Here
she
painted, in the
most
lively colours, the
heinousness
of her offence, and the ignominy and
wretchedness
that awaited her. Her affection
allured, her
reasoning
convinced her
backsliding
sister
. Upon the
promise
of
forgiveness
from her
mother, Myra
consented
to leave her infamous
paramour, and retrace the paths of rectitude and
virtue.
Her
seducer
was
absent
on a journey. She,
therefore, wrote him a farewell letter, couched
in terms of
sincere
penitence for her
transgression
,
and determined
resolution
of amendment in
future, and left the
house
. Thus
restored
and
reconciled to her friends, Myra appeared in quite
another character.
Prudelia tarried with her mother till
she
had
adjusted
her affairs, and
seen
her comfortably
settled
and provided for. Then taking her
reclaimed
sister
with her,
she
returned to her
anxiously
expecting family. The
uprightness
and
modesty
of Myra's conduct, ever after, rendered her
universally
esteemed
, though the painful
consciousness
of her defection was never
extinguished
in
her own
bosom
.
A
constant
sense
of her
past
misconduct
depressed
her
spirits
, and
cast
a gloom over her
mind; yet
she
was virtuous, though
pensive
,
during the remainder of her life.
With this, and other
salutary
effects in view,
how
necessary
, how important are filial and
fraternal
affection!

Friday, P. M.
FRIENDSHIP.
Friendship
is a term, much
insisted
on by young people; but, like many others, more
frequently
used
than
understood
. A friend, with
girls in general, is an intimate acquaintance,
whose
taste
and
pleasures
are
similar
to their own;
who will encourage, or at
least
connive at their
foibles and faults, and communicate with them
every
secret
; in particular
those
of love and
gallantry
,
in which
those
of the other
sex
are
concerned
.
By
such
friends, their errors and
stratagems
are flattered and concealed, while the
prudent
advice of real
friendship
is neglected, till
they find, too late, how fictitious a character, and
how vain a dependence they have
chosen
.
Augusta
and Serena were educated at the
same
school
,
resided
in the
same
neighbourhood,
and were equally volatile in their tempers, and
dissipated
in their manners. Hence every plan of
amusement
was concerted and enjoyed
together
.
At the play, the ball, the card-table,
and every other party of
pleasure
, they were
companions.
Their parents
saw
that this intimacy
strengthened
the follies of each; and
strove
to
disengage
their affections, that they might turn their
attention
to more rational entertainments, and more
judicious
advisers
. But they gloried in their
friendship
, and thought it a
substitute
for every
other virtue. They were the dupes of adulation,
and the votaries of coquetry.
The attentions of a libertine,
instead
of
putting
them on their guard
against
encroachments,
induced them to triumph in their fancied
conquests
,
and to
boast
of
resolution
sufficient
to
shield
them from
delusion
.
Love, however, which, with
such
dispositions
,
is the pretty play-thing of imagination,
assailed
the tender heart of Serena. A gay youth,
with more wit than
sense
, more
show
than
substance
,
more art than
honesty
, took advantage of
her
weakness
to ingratiate
himself
into her favour,
and
persuade
her they could not live without
each other.
Augusta
was the confident of
Serena
.
She fanned the flame, and encouraged her
resolution
of promoting her own felicity, though
at the
expense
of every other duty. Her parents
suspected
her amour,
remonstrated
against
the
man, and forbad her forming any connexion
with him, on pain of their
displeasure
. She
apparently
acquiesced
; but flew to
Augusta
for
counsel
and relief.
Augusta
soothed
her anxiety,
and
promised
to
assist
her in the
accomplishment
of all her
wishes
. She accordingly contrived
means for a
clandestine
intercourse
, both
personal
and
epistolary
.
Aristus
was a foreigner, and avowed his
purpose
of returning to his native country, urging
her to accompany him. Serena had a fortune,
independent of her parents, left her by a
deceased
relation. This, with her hand,
she
consented
to
give to her lover, and to quit a country, in which
she
acknowledged but one friend.
Augusta
praised
her fortitude, and favoured her
design
. She
accordingly eloped and embarked. Her parents
were
almost
distracted
by her imprudent and
undutiful conduct; and their
resentment
fell on
Augusta
, who had acted contrary to all the
dictates
of integrity and
friendship
, in contributing
to her ruin; for ruin it proved. Her
ungrateful
paramour, having rioted on the property
which
she
bestowed
, abandoned her to want and
despair
. She wrote to her parents, but received
no
answer
. She
represented
her
case
to
Augusta
,
and implored relief from her
friendship
; but
Augusta
alleged that
she
had already incurred
the
displeasure
of her family on her account, and
chose
not again to
subject
herself
to
censure
by
the
same
means.
Serena at length returned to her native
shore
,
and applied in
person
to
Augusta
, who coolly
told her that
she
wished
no
intercourse
with a
vagabond, and then retired. Her parents
refused
to receive her into their
house
; but, from
motives
of
compassion
and charity, granted her a
small
annuity, barely
sufficient
to keep her and
her infant from want.
Too late
she
discovered
her
mistaken
notions
of
friendship
; and learned by
sad
experience, that
virtue
must
be its foundation, or
sincerity
and
constancy
can never be its reward.
Sincerity and
constancy
are
essential
ingredients
in virtuous
friendship
. It invariably
seeks
the permanent good of its object; and in
so
doing, will
advise
, caution and reprove, with all
the
frankness
of
undissembled
affection. In the
interchange of genuine
friendship
, flattery is
utterly
excluded. Yet, even in the
most
intimate
connexions of this kind, a proper degree of
respect
,
attention, and
politeness
,
must
be
observed
.
You are not
so
far to
presume
on the partiality
of
friendship
, as to hazard giving offence, and
wounding the feelings of
persons
, merely
because
you think their regard for you will plead your
excuse
, and procure your pardon. Equally
cautious
should
you be, of taking umbrage at
circumstances
which are
undesignedly
offensive
.
Hear the excellent advice of the
wise
son
of
Sirach, upon this
subject
:
Admonish
thy friend; it may be he hath
not done it; and if he have done it, that he do
it no more.
Admonish
thy friend; it may be
he hath not
said
it; and if he have, that he
speak
it not again.
Admonish
thy friend; for
many times it is a
slander
; and believe not every
tale. There is one that
slippeth
in his
speech
,
but not from his heart; and who is he that
offendeth
not with his tongue?
Be not
hasty
in forming
friendships
; but
deliberately examine the principles,
disposition
,
temper, and manners, of the
person
you
wish
to
sustain
this important character. Be well
assured
that they are agreeable to your own, and
such
as
merit your entire
esteem
and confidence, before
you denominate her your friend. You may have
many general acquaintances, with whom you are
pleased
and entertained; but in the chain of
friendship
there is a
still
closer
link.
Reserve
will wound it, and
distrust
destroy
.
Deliberate on all things with thy friend;
But
since
friends grow not thick on ev'ry bough,
Nor ev'ry friend unrotten at the core,
First
, on thy friend, deliberate with
thyself
:
Pause
, ponder,
sift
; not eager in the choice,
Nor jealous of the
chosen
: fixing, fix:
Judge before
friendship
; then confide till death.
But, if you would have friends, you
must
show
yourselves
friendly; that is, you
must
be
careful to act the part you
wish
from another.
If your friend have faults, mildly and tenderly
represent
them to
her;
but conceal them as much
as
possible
from the
observation
of the world.
Endeavour to convince her of her errors, to
rectify her
mistakes
, and to confirm and
increase
every virtuous
sentiment
.
Should
she
so
far deviate, as to endanger her
reputation and
happiness
; and
should
your
admonitions
fail to reclaim her, become not, like
Augusta
, an abettor of her crimes. It is not the
part of
friendship
to hide
transactions
which will
end in the ruin of your friend. Rather acquaint
those
who ought to have the rule over her of her
intended
misteps
, and you will have
discharged
your duty; you will merit, and very probably
may afterwards receive, her thanks.
Narciffa and Florinda were united in the
bonds of true and generous
friendship
. Narciffa
was called to
spend
a few months with a relation
in the metropolis, where
she
became acquainted
with, and attached to a man who was much her
inferior; but
whose
specious
manners and
appearance
deceived her youthful heart, though
her
reason
and judgment informed her, that her
parents would
disapprove
the connexion. When
she
returned home, the
consciousness
of her fault,
the
frankness
which
she
owed to her friend, and
her partiality to her lover, wrought powerfully
upon her mind, and rendered her melancholy.
Florinda
soon
explored the
cause
, and warmly
remonstrated
against
her imprudence in holding a
moment's
intercourse
with a man, who,
she
knew,
would be
displeasing
to her parents. She
searched
out his character, and found it far inadequate to
Narcissa
's merit. This
she
represented
to her in
its true colours, and conjured her not to
sacrifice
her reputation, her duty, and her
happiness
, by
encouraging his
addresses
: but to no
purpose
were her
expostulations
.
Narcissa
avowed the
design
of permitting him to
solicit
the
consent
of
her parents, and the determination of marrying
him without it, if they
refused
.
Florinda was alarmed at this
resolution
; and,
with painful anxiety,
saw
the danger of her
friend. She told her plainly, that the regard
she
had for her demanded a counteraction of her
design
; and that if
she
found no other way of
preventing its execution,
she
should
discharge
her
duty by informing her parents of her
proceedings
.
This
Narcissa
resented
, and immediately
withdrew her confidence and familiarity; but
the faithful Florinda neglected not the watchful
solicitude
of
friendship
; and when
she
perceived
that
Narcissa
's family were
resolutely
opposed
to
her projected match, and that
Narcissa
was
preparing
to put her
rash
purpose
into execution,
she
made known the plan which
she
had concerted,
and by that mean prevented her
destruction
.
Narcissa
thought
herself
greatly injured, and
declared
that
she
would never forgive
so
flagrant a
breach of fidelity. Florinda endeavoured to
convince
her of her good intentions, and the real
kindness
of her motives; but
she
refused
to hear
the voice of
wisdom
, till a
separation
from her
lover, and a full proof of his
unworthiness
,
opened her eyes to a
sight
of her own folly and
indiscretion
, and to a lively
sense
of Florinda's
friendship
, in
saving
her from ruin without her
consent
. Her heart overflowed with gratitude to
her generous
preserver
. She acknowledged
herself
indebted to Florinda's benevolence, for
deliverance
from the baneful
impetuosity
of her
own
passions
. She
sought
and obtained
forgiveness
;
and ever after lived in the
strictest
amity
with her faithful
benefactress
.
I
Saturday, A. M.
LOVE.
The
highest
state
of
friendship
which
this life admits, is in the conjugal relation. On
this refined affection, love, which is but a more
interesting
and tender kind of
friendship
, ought
to be founded. The
same
virtues, the
same
dispositions
and qualities which are
necessary
in a
friend, are
still
more
requisite
in a companion for
life. And when
these
enlivening principles are
united, they form the
basis
of durable
happiness
.
But let not the
mask
of
friendship
, or of love,
deceive
you. You are now entering upon a new
stage
of action, where you will probably admire,
and be admired. You may attract the notice of
many, who will
select
you, as objects of
adulation
,
to
discover
their
taste
and gallantry; and
perhaps of
some
whose
affections you have really
and
seriously
engaged. The
first
class
your
penetration
will enable you to detect; and your good
sense
and virtue will lead you to treat them with
the neglect they
deserve
. It is
disreputable
for a
young lady to receive and encourage the officious
attentions of
those
mere
pleasure
-hunters, who
rove from fair to fair, with no other
design
than
the
exercise
of their art,
address
, and intrigue.
Nothing can render their company
pleasing
, but
a vanity of being
caressed
, and a
false
pride in
being thought an object of general admiration,
with a
fondness
for flattery which
bespeaks
a
vitiated
mind. But when you are
addressed
by a
person
of real merit, who is worthy your
esteem
,
and may
justly
demand your
respect
, let him be
treated with honor,
frankness
, and
sincerity
. It
is the part of a prude, to affect a
shyness
,
reserve
,
and indifference, foreign to the heart.
Innocence and virtue will
rise
superior
to
such
little arts, and indulge no
wish
which needs
disguise
.
Still more unworthy are the
insidious
and
deluding wiles of the coquette. How
disgusting
must
this character appear to
persons
of
sentiment
and integrity! how unbecoming the
delicacy
and dignity of an uncorrupted female!
As you are young and inexperienced, your
affections may
possibly
be involuntarily engaged,
where prudence and duty forbid a connexion.
Beware, then, how you admit the
passion
of love.
In young minds, it is of all others the
most
uncontrollable
.
When fancy takes the reins, it
compels its blinded votary to
sacrifice
reason
,
discretion
and
conscience
to its impetuous
dictates
.
But a
passion
of this origin tends not to
substantial
and durable
happiness
. To
secure
this, it
must
be quite of another kind, enkindled
by
esteem
, founded on merit,
strengthened
by
congenial
dispositions
and
corresponding
virtues,
and terminating in the
most
pure and refined
affection.
Never
suffer
your eyes to be charmed by the
mere exterior; nor delude
yourselves
with the
notion of unconquerable love. The eye, in this
respect
, is often deceptious, and fills the
imagination
with charms which have no reality. Nip,
in the bud, every particular liking, much more
all ideas of love, till called forth by unequivocal
tokens, as well as
professions
of
sincere
regard.
Even then, harbour them not without a thorough
knowledge of the temper,
disposition
, and
circumstances
of your lover, the advice of your
friends; and, above all, the approbation of your
parents. Maturely weigh every
consideration
for and
against
, and deliberately determine with
yourselves
, what will be
most
conducive to your
welfare and felicity in life. Let a rational and
discreet
plan of thinking and acting, regulate your
deportment, and render you
deserving
of the
affection
you
wish
to
insure
. This you will find
far more conducive to your
interest
, than the
indulgence of that romantic
passion
, which a
blind and
misguided
fancy paints in
such
alluring
colours, to the
thoughtless
and
inexperienced
.
Recollect the favourite air you
so
often
sing
:
Ye fair, who would be
bless
'd in love,
Take your pride a little lower;
Let the
swain
that you approve,
Rather like you than adore.
Love that
rises
into
passion
,
Soon will end in hate, or
strife
;
But from tender inclination
Flow the
lasting
joys of life.
I by no means undervalue that love which is
the
noblest
principle of the human mind; but
wish
only to guard you
against
the influence of
an ill-placed and ungovernable
passion
, which is
improperly called by this name.
A union, formed without a refined and
generous
affection for its
basis
,
must
be devoid of
those
tender endearments, reciprocal attentions,
and engaging
sympathies
, which are peculiarly
necessary
to alleviate the cares,
dispel
the
sorrows
,
and
soften
the pains of life. The
exercise
of that prudence and caution which I have
recommended, will lead you to a thorough
investigation
of the character and views of the
man by whom you are
addressed
.
Without good principles, both of religion and
morality, (for the latter cannot
exist
independent
of the former) you cannot
safely
rely, either
upon his fidelity or his affection. Good
principles
are the foundation of a good life.
I 2
If the fountain be pure, the
streams
which
issue
from it will be of the
same
description
.
Next to this, an amiable temper is
essentially
requisite
. A proud, a
passionate
, a revengeful,
a malicious, or a jealous temper, will render
your lives uncomfortable, in
spite
of all the
prudence
and fortitude you can exert.
Beware, then, left, before marriage, love blind
your eyes to
those
defects, to a
sight
of which,
grief and
disappointment
may awaken you
afterwards
.
You are to
consider
marriage as a
connexion
for life; as the
nearest
and
dearest
of
all human relations; as involving in it the
happiness
or
misery
of all your days; and as
engaging you in a variety of cares and duties,
hitherto unknown. Act, therefore, with
deliberation
,
and
resolve
with caution: but, when
once you have come to a choice, behave with
undeviating rectitude and
sincerity
.
Avarice is not commonly a ruling
passion
in
young
persons
of
our
sex
. Yet
some
there are,
sordid
enough to
consider
wealth as the chief
good, and to
sacrifice
every other object to a
splendid
appearance. It often happens, that
these
are
miserably
disappointed
in their
expectations
of
happiness
. They find, by dear-bought
experience, that external pomp is but a wretched
substitute
for internal
satisfaction
.
But I would not have outward
circumstances
entirely overlooked. A proper regard
should
always be had to a comfortable
subsistence
in
life. Nor can you be
justified
in
suffering
a blind
passion
, under whatever pretext, to involve you in
those
embarrassing
distresses
of want, which will
elude the remedies of love
itself
, and prove fatal
to the peace and
happiness
at which you aim.
In this momentous affair, let the advice and
opinion of judicious friends have their
just
weight
in your minds.
Discover
, with candor and
frankness
,
the
progress
of your amour,
so
far as is
necessary
to enable them to judge aright in the
cause
;
but never relate the love-tales of your
suitor
,
merely for your own, or any other
person
's
amusement
. The tender themes,
inspired
by
love, may be
pleasing
to you; but, to an
uninterested
person
,
must
be
insipid
and
disgusting
, in
the extreme.
Never
boast
of the number, nor of the
professions
of your admirers. That betrays an
unsufferable
vanity, and will render you perfectly
ridiculous in the
estimation
of
observers
.
Besides
,
it is a
most
ungenerous treatment of
those
who may have entertained, and
expressed
a regard
for you. Whatever they have
said
upon this
subject
, was
doubtless
in confidence, and you
ought to keep it
sacred
, as a
secret
you have no
right to divulge.
If you
disapprove
the
person
, and reject his
suit
, that will be
sufficiently
mortifying, without
adding the
insult
of
exposing
his overtures.
Be very careful to
distinguish
real lovers from
mere gallants. Think not every man enamoured
with you, who is polite and attentive. You
have no right to
suppose
any man in love with
you, till he declares it in plain, unequivocal,
and decent terms.
Never
suffer
, with impunity, your ear to be
wounded by indelicate
expressions
, double
entendres
,
and infinuating attempts to
seduce
you from
the path of rectitude. True love will not
seek
to degrade its object, much
less
to undermine
that virtue which ought to be its
basis
and
support
.
Let no
protestations
induce you to believe
that
person
your friend, who would
destroy
your
dearest
interests
, and rob you of innocence and
peace. Give no heed to the language of
seduction
;
but repel the
insidious
arts of the libertine,
with the dignity and
decision
of
insulted
virtue.
This practice will
raise
you
superior
to the
wiles of deceivers, and render you invulnerable
by the
specious
flattery of the unprincipled and
debauched.
Think not the libertine worthy of your
company
and
conversation
, even as an acquaintance.
That reformed rakes make the
best
husbands
,
is a common, and I am
sorry
to
say
, a too
generally
received maxim. Yet I cannot conceive,
that any lady, who values, or properly
considers
her own
happiness
, will venture on the dangerous
experiment. The term
reformed
can, in my
opinion, have very little weight;
since
those
,
whose
principles are vitiated, and
whose
minds
are
debased
by a
course
of debauchery and
excess
,
seldom
change their
pursuits
, till
necessity
, or
interest
requires it; and, however
circumstances
may alter or
restrain
their conduct, very little
dependence can be placed on men
whose
disposition
is
still
the
same
, but only prevented from
indulgence by prudential motives. As a rake is
most
conversant
with the
dissolute
and abandoned
of both
sexes
, he
doubtless
forms his opinion of
others by the
standard
to which he has been
accustomed
, and therefore
supposes
all women
of the
same
description
. Having been hackneyed
in the arts of the
baser
sort
, he cannot form an
idea, that any are in reality
superior
to them.
This renders him habitually jealous,
peevish
, and
tyrannical. Even if his vicious inclinations
be
changed, his having
passed
his
best
days in
vice and folly, renders him a very
unsuitable
companion for a
person
of delicacy and
resinement
.
But whatever inducements
some
ladies may
have to
risk
themselves
with
those
who have
the reputation of being reformed, it is truly
surprising
that any
should
be
so
inconsiderate
as to
unite with
such
as are
still
prosessed
libertines.
What hopes of
happiness
can be formed with
men of this character?
Vice and virtue can never
assimilate
; and
hearts divided by them can never
coalesce
. The
former is the parent of
discord
,
disease
, and death;
the latter, of harmony, health, and peace. A
house
divided
against
itself
cannot
stand
; much
less
can
domestic
selicity
subsist
between
such
contrasted
dispositions
.
But however negligent or
mistaken
many
women of real merit may be, relative to their
own
interest
, I cannot but
wish
they would pay
some
regard to the honor and dignity of their
sex
.
Custom
only has rendered vice more
odious
in a woman than in a man. And
shall
we
give our
sanction
to a
custom
,
so
unjust
and
destructive
in its operation; a
custom
which
invites
and encourages the enemies of
society
to
seek
our ruin? Were
those
who glory in the
seduction
of innocence, to meet with the
contempt
they
deserve
, and to be pointedly
neglected
by every female of virtue, they would be
ashamed
of their evil practices, and impelled to
relinquish
their injurious
designs
.
But while they are received and
caressed
in
the
best
companies, they find
restraint
altogether
needless
; and their being men of
spirit
and
gallantry
(as they
style
themselves
) is rather a
recommendation
than a reproach!
I cannot help
blushing
with indignation,
when I
see
a lady of
sense
and character
gallanted
and entertained by a man who ought to
be
banished
society
, for having ruined the peace
of families, and
blasted
the reputation of many,
who, but for him, might have been
useful
and
happy in the world; but who, by his
insidious
arts, are plunged into
remediless
insignificance
,
disgrace
, and
misery
.
Saturday, P. M.
RELIGION.
Having
given you my
sentiments
on
a variety of
subjects
which demand your
particular
attention, I come now to the
closing
and
most
important theme; and that is Religion.
The virtuous education which you have received,
and the good principles which have been
instilled
into your minds from infancy, will render the
enforcement of
Christian
precepts and duties a
pleasing
lesson
.
Religion is to be
considered
as an
essential
and durable object; not as the
embellishment
of
a day; but an
acquisition
which
shall
endure and
increase
through the
endless
ages of eternity.
Lay the foundation of it in youth, and it
will not
forsake
you in advanced age; but
furnish
you with an adequate
substitute
for the
transient
pleasures
which will then
desert
you; and
prove a
source
of rational and
resined
delight; a
refuge from the
disappointments
and corroding
cares of life, and from the
depressions
of
adverse
events. Remember now your Creator, in the
days of your youth, while the evil days come not,
nor the years draw nigh, when you
shall
say
, we
have no
pleasure
in them. If you
wish
for
permanent
happiness
, cultivate the divine favour
as your
highest
enjoyment in life, and your
safest
retreat when death
shall
approach you.
That even the young are not exempt from
the
arrest
of this
universal
conqueror, the
tombstone
of Amelia will tell you. Youth, beauty,
health and fortune,
strewed
the path of life with
flowers, and left her no
wish
ungratified. Love,
with its
gentlest
and
purest
flame, animated her
heart, and was equally returned by Julius.
Their
passion
was approved by their parents and
friends; the day was fixed, and preparations
were making for the celebration of their
nuptials
.
At this period, Amelia was attacked by a
violent cold, which,
seating
on her lungs, baffled
the
skill
of the
most
eminent
physicians
, and
terminated
in a confirmed hectic. She perceived
her
disorder
to be incurable, and with
inexpressible
regret and concern anticipated her
approaching
dissolution
. She had enjoyed life too highly
to think much of death; yet die
she
must
!
Oh,
said
she
, that I had prepared, while in
health and at
ease
, for this awful event! Then
should
I not be
subjected
to the
keenest
distress
of
mind, in addition to the
most
painful infirmities
of body! Then
should
I be able to look forward
with hope, and to find relief in the
consoling
expectation
of being united, beyond the grave,
K
with
those
dear and beloved connexions, which
I
must
soon
leave behind! Let my companions
and acquaintance learn from me the important
lesson
of improving their time to the
best
of
purposes
; of acting at once as becomes mortal
and immortal creatures!
Hear, my dear pupils, the
soleman
admonition
,
and be ye
also
ready!
Too many,
especially
of the young and gay,
seem
more anxious to live in
pleasure
, than to
answer
the end of their being by the cultivation
of that piety and virtue which will render them
good members of
society
,
useful
to their friends
and
associates
, and partakers of that heart-felt
satisfaction
which
results
from a
conscience
void
of offence both towards God and man.
This, however, is an egregious
mistake
; for
in many
situations
, piety and virtue are our only
source
of
consolation
; and in all, they are
peculiarly
friendly to our
happiness
.
Do you exult in beauty, and the pride of
external charms? Turn your eyes, for a moment,
on the
miserable
Flirtilla.
[1]

.
Like her, your
features
and complexion may be impaired by
disease
:
and where then will you find a refuge
from mortification and
discontent
, if
destitute
of
those
ennobling endowments which can
raise
you
superior
to the
transient
graces of a fair form;
if unadorned by that
substantial
beauty of mind
which can not only
ensure
respect
from
those
around you, but
inspire
you with
resignation
to
the divine will, and a patient
acquiescence
in the
most
painful allotments of a holy Providence?
Does wealth await your command, and
grandeur
with its
fascinating
appendages beguile your
fleeting moments? Recollect, that riches often
make
themselves
wings and fly away. A
single
instance
of
mismanagement
; a
consuming
fire,
with various other misfortunes which no human
prudence can
foresee
or prevent, may
strip
you
of this dependence; and,
unless
you have other
grounds of comfort than earth can
boast
, reduce
you to the
most
insupportable
wretchedness
and
despair
. Are you
surrounded
by friends, and
happy in the
society
of
those
who are near and
dear to you? Soon may they be
wrested
from
your fond embrace, and
consigned
to the
mansions
of the dead!
Whence, then, will you derive
support
, if
unacquainted with that divine Friend, who will
never fail nor
forsake
you; who is the
same
yesterday
, to-day, and forever?
Health and youth, my dear girls, are the
seasons
for improvement. Now you may lay up
a
treasure
which neither
sickness
nor
adversity
can impair.
But the hour of
distress
is not the only time,
in which religion will be advantageous to you.
Even in
prosperity
, it will prove the
best
solace
,
and the
highest
ornament of your lives. What
can be more dignified,
respectable
, and lovely,
than the
Christian
character? The habitual
practice of
those
duties which the
gospel
inculcates
will give
lustre
to your beauty and
durability
to your charms. By correcting your
passions
,
it will improve your joys, endear you to
your friends and connexions, and render you
contented, happy, and
useful
in every
stage
and
condition of life.
Religion will not deprive you of temporal
enjoyments
;
it will heighten and
increase
them.
It will not
depress
, but exhilarate your
spirits
.
For it
consists
not in a gloomy,
misanthropic
temper, declining the
social
and innocent
delights
of life; but prepares the mind to partake
with
satisfaction
of every
pleasure
which
reason
approves, and which can yield
serenity
and peace
in the review. Be not
ashamed
then of
appearing
religious, and of
rising
by that mean
above the vain, unthinking crowd.
Let not the idle
jests
of
heedless
and
unprincipled
companions deter you from a
stedfast
adherence to the path of truth and
righteousness
.
Follow not the multitude to do evil. Never
conform to
fashion
, even though it claim the
patronage of
politeness
,
so
far as to countenance
irreligion in any of its modifications.
Jesting
upon
sacred
subjects
, ridiculing the
professors
of
Christianity
, light and irreverent
conduct upon
solemn
occasions
, ought to be
cautiously
avoided and decidedly condemned. Too
many girls are
so
extremely
thoughtless
as to
carry the levity of their manners even to the
sanctuary
; and by
whispering
, winking,
tittering
,
and other indecent actions,
display
their
folly
to their own
disgrace
, and to the great
disgust
of all judicious and
sober
people. Such
behaviour is not only
offensive
to the Deity, but
insulting
to all who would
worship
him free from
interruption. It is not only an indignity offered to
religion, but a flagrant breach of the rules of good
breeding. Content not
yourselves
, therefore,
with a bare attendance on the
institutions
of
religion
;
but conduct with propriety, decorum,
and
seriousness
, while engaged in the
solemn
service
.
Bear in mind, that you
assemble
with a
professed
purpose
of paying homage to the
Supreme
;
and
consider
yourselves
as in his
immediate
presence
!
The offices of devotion demand your
attention
in private, as well as in public.
Accustom
yourselves
, therefore, to
stated
periods of retirement for meditation and prayer;
and adopt every other mean which is
calculated
to keep alive in your minds a due
sense
of
your dependence and obligations, and to
inspire
you with that uniform love to God and
benevolence to the human kind, which will prove
your
greatest
glory here, as well as your crown
of rejoicing hereafter.

THE hour of departure having arrived, on
Monday morning, Mrs. Williams
assembled
with
her pupils; when the regret,
visibly
depicted on
every countenance, was
variously
expressed
. The
tear of grateful regard
stole
silently
down the
bloomy cheeks of
some
: others betrayed their
sensibility
by audible
sobs
, which they could not
repress
and all united in
testifying
the
sense
they entertained of the advantages they had
received
from Mrs. Williams's tuition, the
happiness
they had enjoyed in each other's
society
, and
their determination to remember her
counsels
,
cultivate continued
friendship
among
themselves
,
and endeavour to be worthy of her's.
Mrs. Williams then took an affectionate leave
of each one, and left them with her daughters.
The
most
cordial good
wishes
were mutually
interchanged
,
till their carriages received and
separated
them.
The
friendship
and unity thus commenced and
confirmed, were never obliterated. They always
cherished
the
most
sincere
affection for their
Preceptress
,
and each other; which they
displayed
in
an
unreserved
and
social
correspondence
, both
personal
and
epistolary
. The
residence
of Mrs.
Williams they denominated
Harmony-Grove
,
which it ever after retained, and by which it is
designated
in the following
selection
of their
letters.
LETTERS.
To Mrs.
M. WILLIAMS.
Boston
.
RESPECTED AND DEAR MADAM,
Conformably
to my
promise
, when
I left your abode, the
first
efforts of my pen are
dedicated to you. The
pleasure
which
arises
from the recollection of your more than
maternal
kindness
to me,
especially
your unwearied
endeavours
to refine and
embellish
my mind, and to
lay the foundation of right principles and
practices
,
is interwoven with my
existence
; and no
time or
circumstances
can
erase
my gratitude.
I arrived
last
evening
safely
; and was
affectionately
received by my honored parents, and
beloved brothers and
sisters
. The emotions of
regret which I felt in the morning, at the painful
separation
from you and my dear
school
-mates,
with whom I have lived
so
happily, had not
wholly
subsided
. I could not help
listening
, now and
then, for
some
judicious
observation
from my
Preceptress
; and frequently
cast
my eyes around
in
search
of
some
of the amiable companions,
among whom I had been
used
to unbend every
thought.
The
splendor
of the apartments gave me ideas
of
restraint
that were painful; and I looked
abroad for the green, where we were wont to
gambol, and the lawn where we
so
often held our
twilight
sports
, and
almost
fancied that we
sometimes
caught a
glimpse
of the attendant Sylphs
who played around us; but in vain. Stately
domes, crowded
streets
, rattling carriages, and
all the
noise
and
confusion
of a commercial city
were
substituted
. I retired to bed, and was
awaked in the night by the riotous mirth of a
number of Bachanalians, reeling from the haunts
of intemperance and
excess
.
Alas!
said
I, this is not the olian harp that
used
to
soothe
our
slumbers
at the boarding
school
.
I
composed
myself
again; but awoke at the
accustomed
hour of five. I
arose
; and, having
praised
my Maker for the
preservations
of the
night, walked down. Not a living creature was
stirring
in the
house
.
I took a turn in the garden. Here art
seemed
to reign
so
perfectly
mistress
, that I was
apprehensive
lest
I
should
injure her charms by
viewing
them.
I accordingly retired to the
summer
-
house
, and,
having a book in my hand,
sat
down and read
till the clock
struck
seven
. I then thought it
must
be
breakfast
time, and returned to the
house
;
but was much
disappointed
to find none of the
family up, except one man-
servant
and the
housemaid
,
who had
just
crept down.
They appeared perfectly
astonished
to
see
me
come in from abroad; and the girl
respectfully
inquired if
indisposition
had
occasioned
my
rising
so
early. I told her no; that the
wish
to
preserve
my health had called me up two hours
before. Well, rejoined
she
, you will not find any
body to keep you company here, for two hours
to come. I was chagrined at the information,
and
asked
her for a bowl of milk, it being
past
my
usual
breakfast
time. The milk man had
just
arrived, and I drank
some
; but it had
lost
its
flavour on the road. It was not like that which
was
served
us at Harmony-Grove. I
stepped
to
the
harpsichord
, and having
sung
and played a
morning hymn, returned to my chamber, where,
taking my work, I
sat
down by the window to
view the
listless
tribe of yawning mortals who
were beginning to thicken in the
streets
. One
half of
these
appeared to be dragged forth by
necessity
,
rather than any inclination to enjoy the
beauties of a fine morning.
At nine, I was
summoned
into the parlour to
breakfast
. My
sisters
gently chid me for
disturbing
their
repose
with my
music
. I
excused
myself
by alleging that I had been
so
long
accustomed
to early
rising
that I
should
find it difficult
to alter the habit.
Here, madam, you have an account of my
first
night and morning's occupation. Were I to
proceed
with every new occurrence, through the
year, and
subjoin
my own remarks, I
must
write
volumes
instead
of letters.
Please
to communicate this
scroll
to your
amiable
daughters, and remind them of their
promise
to write.
A line from Harmony-Grove would be a
luxury
to me:
Meanwhile, permit me
still
to
subscribe
myself
,
with the
utmost
respect
, your grateful pupil,
HARRIOT HENLY.
To
Miss
MATILDA FIELDING.
Boston
.
DEAR MATILDA,
I DID not intend, when we parted at the
boarding
school
, that a whole month
should
have
elapsed
without bearing you
some
testimony
of
my continued
friendship
and affection; but
so
numerous have been my avocations, and
so
various
my engagements, that I have
scarcely
called
a moment my own
since
I returned home.
Having been from town a year, I was
considered
as too antique to appear in company abroad, till
I had been perfectly
metamorphosed
. Every part
of my habit has undergone a complete change, in
conformity to the
present
fashion
. It was with
extreme regret that I parted with the
neatness
and
simplicity
of my country
dress
; which,
according
to my ideas of
modesty
, was more
becoming
.
But, I
trust
, this alteration of
appearance
will have no tendency to alienate
those
sentiments
from my heart, which I imbibed
under the tuition of Mrs. Williams.
I went,
last
evening, to the
assembly
; but
though dazzled, I was by no means charmed, by
the glare of finery and
tinselled
decorations that
were
displayed
.
There were
some
ladies,
whose
gentility and
fashionable
dress
were evidently the product of
a correct
taste
; but others were
so
disguised
by
tawdry gewgaws, as to
disgust
me exceedingly.
Mrs. Williams
used
to
say
, that the
dress
was
indicative of the mind. If this
observation
be
just
, what opinion am I to form of the gay
multitudes
who trip along the
streets
, and throng the
places of public
resort
in this metropolis; the
lightness
and
gaudiness
of
whose
appearance,
bespeak
a
sickly
taste
, to
say
no more!
I am
furnished
with feathers, flowers, and
ribbons, in
profusion
. I
shall
, however,
use
them very
sparingly
; and though I would not
be entirely
singular
, yet I
must
insist
on
consulting
my own fancy a little, and cannot willingly
sacrifice
my own opinion to the capricious whims
of
fashion
, and her devotees. My aunt Laurence,
who, you know, is extravagantly genteel, is
making us a
visit
. She laughs very heartily at
my
silly
notions, as
she
calls them, and
styles
me
a novice in the ways of the world; but hopes,
notwithstanding
, that I
shall
acquire a better
taste
, when I am more acquainted with
fashionable
life. That I may be much improved by a
more
extensive
knowledge of the world, I doubt
not; yet may I never be corrupted by that levity
and folly, which are too prevalent among a part
of my
sex
.
I will not, however,
censure
and condemn
others; but attend to
myself
and be humble.
Adieu.
LAURA GUILFORD.
To
Miss
MATILDA FIELDING.
Harmony-Grove
.
DEAR MATILDA,
The
tear of regret for your departure is
scarcely
dried from the cheek of your Maria;
and the
pleasing
remembrance of the
happiness
I have enjoyed in your
society
is accompanied
with a
sigh
, whenever I reflect that it
exists
no more.
My mamma has often
observed
, that
those
friendships
which are formed in youth, provided
they be well founded, are the
most
sincere
, lively,
and durable. I am
sure
that the ardency of mine
can never abate; my affectionate regards for you
can never decay.
We have another
class
of boarders; but you
and your amiable companions had
so
entirely
engrossed
my confidence and
esteem
, that I
shall
find it difficult to transfer them, in any degree,
to others. The
sensations
of Anna are very
different, though
she
is capable of the
most
refined
friendship
. The natural vivacity, and, as
I tell her, the volatility of her
disposition
, renders
a variety of
associates
pleasing
to her.
In order to recal your ideas to the
exercises
of Harmony-Grove, I
enclose
the
sallies
of my
pen for this morning, fully
assured
of your
candour
and
generosity
in the
perusal
.
L
Pray omit no opportunity of writing, and
favour
me with your
observations
on the polite
world. I
shall
receive every line as a pledge of
your continued love to your
MARIA WILLIAMS.
An
ODE on SPRING.
Enclosed
in the preceding Letter
.
Hail
, delight-
restoring
Spring!
Balmy
pleasures
with thee bring;
Aromatic gales
dispense
,
Misty
vapours
banish
hence.
Blithe the jocund hinds appear,
Joy
supports
returning care,
Mirth the ready hand attends,
Pleasing
hope the toil befriends.
Hark! the
shady
groves
resound
,
Love and
praise
re-echo round;
Music
floats in every gale,
Peace and harmony prevail.
Here no
stormy
passions
rise
;
Here no feuds impede our joys;
Here ambition never roams,
Pride or envy never comes.
Come, Matilda; ruddy morn
Tempts us o'er the
spacious
lawn;
Spring's reviving charms invite
Every
sense
to
taste
delight.
Such delights as never cloy,
Health and innocence enjoy.
Youth's the
spring
-time of our years,
Short the rapid
scene
appears:
Let's improve the fleeting hours!
Virtue's
noblest
fruits be ours.
To
Miss
CAROLINE LITTLETON.
Boston

You
have leftyou have
forsaken
me,
Caroline! But I will haunt you with my
letters
;
obtrude
myself
upon your remembrance;
and extort from you the continuance of your
friendship
!
What do I
say
? Obtrude and extort! Can
these
harsh
words be
used
when I am
addressing
the generous and faithful Caroline?
But you have often encouraged my
eccentricities
by your
smile
, and
must
therefore
still
indulge
them.
Nature has
furnished
me with a gay
disposition
;
and happy is it for me, that a lax
education
has not
strengthened
the folly too commonly
arising
from it.
Mrs. Williams's
instructions
were very
seasonably
interposed
to
impress
my mind with a
sense
of virtue and propriety. I
trust
they have had
the
desired
effect; and that they will prove the
guardian of my youth, and the directory of
maturer
age. How often has the dear, good
woman
taken me into her chamber, and reminded
me of indecorums of which I was
unconscious
at the time; but thankful afterwards that they
had not
escaped
her judicious eye; as her
observations
tended to rectify my errors, and render
me more cautious and
circumspct
in future.
How
salutary
is advice like her's; conveyed, not
with the dogmatic air of
supercilious
wisdom
;
but with the
condescending
ease
and
soothing
kindness
of an affectionate parent,
anxiously
concerned for the
best
good of
those
under her
care!
I was very happy at Harmony-Grove; and
the
result
of that
happiness
, I hope, will
accompany
me through life.
Yet I find the gaiety of the town adapted to
my
taste
; nor does even Mrs. Williams condemn
the enjoyment of its
pleasures
.
I was,
last
evening, at a ball; and I
assure
you, the attention I gained, and the gallantry
displayed
to attract my notice and approbation,
were very flattering to my vanity; though I
could not forbear inwardly
smiling
at the futile
arts of the pretty fellows who exhibited them.
Their
speeches
appeared to have been
so
long
practised
, that I was on the point of
advising
them to
exercise
their genius, if they had any,
in the invention of
something
new. But a
polite
conformity to the
ton
restrained
my
satire
,
Adieu.

To
Miss
CLEORA PARTRIDGE.
Newbury-Port
.
I AM
disappointed
and
displeased
, Cleora!
I have long been anxious to procure the
Marchioness
de Sevign's letters, having often heard
them mentioned as
standards
of
taste
and
elegance
in the
epistolary
way. This excited my
curiosity
, and
raised
my hopes of finding a rich
entertainment of wit and
sentiment
. I have
perused
, and
perused
in vain; for they
answer
not my ideas of either. They are replete with
local
circumstances
, which, to indifferent
readers
,
are neither
amusing
nor
interesting
. True,
the
style
is
easy
and
sprightly
; but they are
chiefly
composed
of family matters,
such
as
relate
to her own movements and
those
of her
daughter; many of which are of too trifling a
nature to be ranked in the
class
of elegant
writing
.
I own
myself
, however, not a competent
judge of their merit as a whole, even in my own
estimation
; for I have read the two
first
volumes
only.
That letters ought to be written with the
familiarity
of
personal
conversation
, I allow; yet
many
such
conversations
, even between
persons
of
taste
and refinement, are unworthy the public
attention.
Equal was my chagrin, not long
since
, on
reading Pope's letters. He,
said
I to
myself
,
who bears the palm from all contemporary
poets
,
and who is
so
consummate
a
master
of this
divine art,
must
surely
furnish
a
source
of
superior
entertainment, when he
descends
to
friendly
and
social
communications.
Indeed, there are good
sentiments
and
judicious
observations
,
interspersed
in his letters;
but the greater part of them have little other
merit than what
arises
from the
style
.
Perhaps you will charge me with arrogance,
for
presuming
to
criticise
, much more to
condemn
,
publications which have
so
long been
sanctioned
by general approbation. Independent in
opinion, I write it without
reserve
, and
censure
not any one who thinks differently. Give me
your
sentiments
with the
same
freedom upon the
books which you honor with a
perusal
, and you
will oblige your affectionate
CAROLINE LITTLETON.
To
Miss
CAROLINE LITTLETON.
Salem
.
DEAR CAROLINE,
I RECEIVED your's with
those
lively
sensations
of
pleasure
which your favours always afford.
As I was
perusing
it, my papa came into the
room. He took it out of my hand, and read it;
then returning it with the
smile
of approbation;
I think,
said
he, that your
correspondent
has
played the critic very well. Has
she
played it
justly
,
Sir?
said
I. Why, it is a long time,
said
he,
since
I read the
Marchioness
de Sevign's letters.
I am not, therefore, a judge of their merit.
But, with regard to Pope, I blame not the
sex
for retaliating upon him; for he always treated
them
satirically
I believe revenge was no part
of my friend's plan,
said
I. She is far
superior
to
so
malignant a
passion
; though, were
she
capable
of
seeking
it, it would be in behalf of her
sex
.
Company now coming in, the
conversation
shifted
.
I have often
smiled
at the pitiful wit of
those
satirists
and
essayifts
who
lavish
abundant
eloquence
on trifling foibles, the mere whims of a
day; and of no
consequence
to the body
natural
,
moral, or political. The
extension
of a
hoop, the contraction of the
waist
, or the
elevation
of the head-
dress
, frequently afford matter
for pages of elaborate
discussion
.
These
reformers
,
too, always aim at the good of our
sex
! I
think it a great pity they do not lop off
some
of
their own exuberant follies; though, perhaps,
they
wish
us to exchange labours; and, in
return
for their benevolent exertions, that we
endeavour
to
expose
and correct their errors. I
have
sometimes
thought their
satire
to be
tinctured
with malice; and that the
cause
of their
disaffection
may generally be found in
personal
resentment
. Had Pope and his coadjutors been
favourites with the ladies, I doubt not but they
would have found more excellencies in them
than they have ever yet allowed.
I have lately been reading the generous and
polite
Fitzosborne
's letters; and I need not tell
you how much I was
pleased
and charmed with
them.
The
justness
of his
sentiments
, and the
ease
and elegance of his diction are at once
interesting
and improving. His letter and ode to his
wife on the
anniversary
of their marriage,
surpass
any thing of the kind I have ever read.
I verily think, that, had I the offer of a heart
capable of dicting
such
manly
tenderness
of
expression
, and
such
pathetic energy of generous
love, I
should
be willing to give my hand in
return
,
and affent to
those
solemn
words, love,
honor, and(I had
almost
said
) obey. Adieu.
CLEORA PARTRIDGE.
To
Miss
CLEORA PARTRIDGE.
Newbury-Port
.
DEAR CLEORA,
I AGREE with you, that the habits of the
weak and vain are too
insignificant
to employ
the pens of
those
,
whose
literary talents might
produce great and good effects in the political,
moral, and religious
state
of things. Were
absurd
fashions
adopted only by
those
whose
frivolity
renders them the dupes of folly, and
whose
example can have no effect on the
considerate
and judicious part of the community, I
should
think them below the attention of
statesmen
,
philosophers
, and divines: but this is not the
case
. The votaries and the inventors of the
most
fantastical
fashions
are found in the ranks
of, what is called, refined and
polished
society
;
from whom we might hope for examples of
elegance
and propriety, both in
dress
and behaviour.
By
these
, luxury and extravagance are
sanctioned
.
Their influence upon the poorer
class
is
increased
; who, emulous of imitating their
superiors
,
think
that
the
most
eligible appearance,
(however beyond their income, or
unsuitable
to
their
circumstances
and condition in life) which
is preferred and countenanced by their
wealthier
neighbours.
Absurd
and
expensive
fashions
, then, are
injurious
to
society
at large, and require
some
check; and why is not
satire
levelled
against
them, laudable in its
design
, and likely to
produce
a good effect? Adieu.
CAROLINE LITTLETON.
To
Miss
MATILDA FIELDING.
Harmony-Grove
.
DEAR MATILDA,
Notwithstanding
the
coldness
of
the
season
, every heart
seems
to be enlivened, and
every mind exhilarated by the
anniversary
of the
new year. Why this day is
so
peculiarly
marked
out for congratulations, I
shall
not now
inquire
;
but in compliance with the prevailing
custom
of
expressing
good
wishes
on the
occasion
,
send
you mine in a
scribble
.
Early I greet the opening year,
While
friendship
bids the
muse
appear,
To
wish
Matilda
bless
'd.
The
muse
, devoid of
selfish
art,
Obeys the dictates of a heart,
Which warms a friendly
breast
.
The rolling earth again has run
Her annual circuit round the
sun
,
And whirl'd the year away:
She now her wonted
course
renews,
Her orbit's track again
pursues
;
Nor feels the
least
decay.
How
soon
the fleeting hours are gone!
The rapid wheels of time glide on,
Which bring the
seasons
round.
Winter
disrobes
the
smiling
plain,
But
spring
restores
its charms again,
And decks the fertile ground.
The
sweet
returns of cheerful May
Come with a vivifying ray,
Inspring
new delight:
Beclad with every various charm
To
please
the eye, the fancy warm,
And animate the
sight
.
But youth no kind renewal knows;
Swiftly the blooming
season
goes,
And brings the
frost
of age!
No more the vernal
sun
appears,
To gild the painful round of years,
And wintry damps affuage!
With rapid
haste
the moments fly
Which you and I, my friend, enjoy;
And they return no more!
Then let us
wisely
now improve
The downy moments, as they rove,
Which nature can't
restore
.
O Source of
wisdom
! we implore
Thy aid to guide us
safely
o'er
The
slippery
paths of youth:
O deign to lend a
steady
ray
To point the
sure
, the certain way
To honor and to truth!
Let thy unerring influence
shed
Its
blessings
on Matilda's head,
While piety and peace,
M
Thy genuine offspring, round her wait,
And guard her thro' this
transient
state
,
To joys that never
cease
!
May
constant
health its charms extend,
And fortune every
blessing
lend,
To crown each
passing
day:
May
pleasures
in
succession
shine
,
And every heart-felt
bliss
be thine,
Without the
least
allay.
MARIA WILLIAMS.
To
Miss
CLEORA PARTRIDGE.
Boston
.
DEAR CLEORA,
I HAVE this week engaged in the
celebration
of the nuptials of my friend, Amanda South.
A
splendid
wedding, a gay company, an elegant
supper
, and a magnificent ball, were the
sum
of
our entertainment.
I imagine
such
exhilarating
scenes
designed
to
dispel
the anxiety and
thoughtfulness
, which
every
reflecting
person
must
feel on this
solemn
occasion
. This untried
state
presents
to the
apprehensive
mind
such
a variety of new cares and
duties, that
cheerfulness
,
festivity
, and hilarity
seem
necessary
to
banish
the thought of them,
so
far as to render a delicate and
sensible
female
sufficiently
composed
to conduct with propriety.
But I
must
confess
, that, were I called to the
trial, I
should
choose
to retire from the
observation
of
those
indifferent and unfeeling
spectators
,
to whom the
blushing
modesty
of a bride is often
a
pastime
.
Indeed, Cleora, when we look around the
world and
observe
the great number of unhappy
marriages, which were contracted with the
brightest
prospects
, yet, from
some
unsoreseen
cause
,
have involved the parties in
wretchedness
for life,
we may well indulge a diffidence of our own
abilities to
discharge
the duties of the
station
, and
be
solicitous
that our future companion
should
in all
respects
be qualified to
assist
in bearing the
burdens of the conjugal
state
.
Experience only can determine how far we
are right in the judgment we form of
ourselves
,
and of the
person
of our choice. So many are
the deceptions which love and
courtship
impose
upon their votaries, that I believe it very difficult
for the parties concerned to judge impartially, or
to
discern
faults, where they look only for virtues.
Hence they are
so
frequently
misled
in their
opinions
,
and find, too late, the errors into which they
have been betrayed.
When do you come to
Boston
, Cleora? I am
impatient for your
society
;
because
your
friendship
is void of flattery, and your
sincerity
and
cheerfulness
are always agreeable and
advantageous
.
Adieu.
HARRIOT HENLY.
To
Miss
HARRIOT HENLY.
Salem
.
Indeed
, Harriot, I open your letters with
as much gravity as I would a
sermon
; you have
such
a knack of moralizing upon every event!
What mortal
else
would feel
serious
and
sentimental
at a wedding?
Positively
, you
shall
not
come to mine. Your
presence
, I fear, would
put
such
a
restraint
upon me, as to render me
quite
foolish
and awkward in my appearance.
However, I
must
acknowledge it a weighty
affair
;
and what you
say
has, perhaps, too much
truth in it to be
jested
with. I believe,
therefore
,
we had better
resolve
not to
risk
the
consequences
of a wrong choice, or imprudent
conduct
;
but
wisely
devote
ourselves
to celibacy.
I am
sure
we
should
make a couple of very
clever
old maids. If you agree to this
proposition
,
we will begin in
season
to
accustom
ourselves
to
the virtues and habits of a
single
life. By
observing
what is
amiss
in the conduct of others in
the
same
state
, and avoiding their errors, I doubt
not but we may bring even the title into repute.
In this way we
shall
be
useful
to many of our
own
sex
, though I am aware it would be a
most
grievous
dispensation
to a couple of the other;
but no matter for that.
M 2
The world needs
some
such
examples as we
might become; and if we can be
instrumental
of retrieving
old-
maidism
from the imputation of
ill-nature, oddity, and many other mortifying
charges, which are now brought
against
it, I
believe we
shall
save
many a good girl from an
unequal and unhappy marriage. It might have
a
salutary
effect on the other
sex
too. Finding
the ladies independent in
sentiment
, they would
be impelled to greater
circumspection
of conduct
to merit their favour.
You
see
that my benevolence is
extensive
. I
wish
to become a general reformer. What
say
you to my plan, Harriot? If you approve it,
dismiss
your long train of admirers immediately,
and act not the part of a coquette, by retaining
them out of pride or vanity. We
must
rise
above
such
narrow views, and let the world
know that we act from principle, if we mean to
do good by our example. I
shall
continue to
receive the
addresses
of this
same
Junius, till I
hear that you have acceded to my
proposal
;
and then,
display
my fortitude by renouncing a
connexion which
must
be doubtful as to the
issue
, and will certainly
expose
me to the
mortification
of being looked at, when I am married.
Farewell.
CLEORA PARTRIDGE.
To
Miss
CAROLINE LITTLETON.
Boston
.
DEAR CAROLINE,
I HAVE
just
returned from a rural
excursion
,
where, in the thicket of a grove, I enjoyed
all the luxury of
solitude
. The
sun
had nearly
finished
his diurnal
course
, and was leaving our
hemisphere
to illuminate the other with his
cheering rays.
The
sprightly
songsters
had retired to their
bowers, and were
distending
their little throats
with a tribute of
instinctive
gratitude and
praise
.
The vocal
strains
re-echoed from tree to tree,
and invited me to join the
responsive
notes. My
heart expanded with devotion and benevolence.
I
wished
the whole human kind to
share
the
feelings
and the
happiness
which I enjoyed; while
the inanimate creation around
seemed
to partake
of my
satisfaction
! Methought the fields
assumed
a livelier verdure; and the zephyrs were
unusually
officious in wafting the fragrance of
aromatic gales. I
surveyed
the
surrounding
scenery
with rapturous admiration; and my
heart glowed with
inexpressible
delight at the
lovely appearance of nature, and the
diffusive
bounties of its almighty Author!
Let others,
said
I, exult in
stately
domes, and
the
superfluities
of pomp;
immerse
themselves
in the
splendid
novelties of
fashion
, and a
promiscuous
crowd of giddy
amusements
! I envy
them not.
Give me a mind to range the
sylvan
scene
,
And
taste
the
blessings
of the vernal day;
While
social
joys, and friendly, intervene
To
chase
the gloomy cares of life away.
I
wish
not to abandon
society
, nor to
resign
the
pleasures
which it affords; but it is a
select
number of friends, not a
promiscuous
crowd,
which I
preser
.
When the mind is much
engrossed
by
dissipating
pleasures
, it is apt to forget
itself
, and
neglect
its own dignity and improvement. It is
necessary
often to retreat from the
noise
and
bustle
of the world, and commune with our own hearts.
By this mean we
shall
be the better qualified
both to
discharge
the duties and participate the
enjoyments of life.
Solitude affords a nearer and more
distinct
view of the works of creation; elevates the
mind, and purifies its
passions
and affections.
O Solitude! in thee the
boundless
mind
Expands
itself
, and revels unconfin'd;
From thee, each vain, each grov'lling
passion
slies
And all the virtues of the
soul
arise
!
Adieu.

MY DEAR LAURA,
Rambling
in the garden, I have
picked
a
nosegay
, which I
transmit
to you as a token
of my remembrance. Though the poetical
bagatelle
which accompanies it is not equal to the
elegance of the
subject
; yet I confide in your
candour to
excuse
its futility, and give a
favourable
interpretation to its
design

Laura, this little gift approve,
Pluck'd by the hand of cordial love!
With
nicest
care the wreath I've
dress
'd,
Fit to adorn your friendly
breast
.
The
rose
and lilly are combin'd,
As emblems of your virtuous mind!
Pure as the
first
is
seen
in thee
Sweet
blushing
sensibility
.
Carnations here their charms
display
,
And nature
shines
in rich array,
Od'rous, as virtue's accents
sweet
,
From Laura's lips with wit replete.
The myrtle with the laurel bound,
And purple amaranthus crown'd,
Within this little knot unite,
Like Laura's charms, to give delight!
Fair, fragrant,
soft
, like beauty
dress
'd;
So
she
unrivall'd
stands
confess
'd;
While blending
still
each
finish
'd grace,
Her virtues in her mien we trace;
Virtues, which far all tints
outshine
,
And, verdant, brave the
frost
of time.
I am, &c.
SOPHIA MANCHESTER.
To
Miss
MARIA WILLIAMS.
Boston
.
DEAR SISTER,
I AM not
so
far engaged by the new
scenes
of
fashionable
gaiety which
surround
me, as to
forget you and the other dear friends, whom I
left at Harmony-Grove. Yet
so
great is the
novelty which I find in this crowded metropolis,
that you cannot wonder if my attention is very
much
engrossed
. Mr. and Mrs. Henly, with
their amiable daughters, are extremely polite and
attentive to me; and have taken every method
to contribute to my
amusement
. I went,
yesterday
,
in their company, to Commencement at
Cambridge; and was very much entertained with
the exhibition. I pretend not to be a judge of
the talents
displayed
by the young gentlemen
who took an active part; or of the proficiency
they had made in
science
. I have an opinion of
my own,
notwithstanding
; and can tell how far
my eye and ear were gratified.
I never knew before that
dress
was a
classical
study
; which I now conclude it
must
be, or it
would not have
exercised
the genius of
some
of
the principal
speakers
on this public
occasion
!
The female garb too,
seemed
to claim
particular
attention. The
bon ton
,
taste
, and
fashions
of
our
sex
, afforded a
subject
of declamation to the
orator and of entertainment to the audience,
composed
, in part, of our
legislators
, politicians,
and divines! I could not but think that
those
scholars
who employ their time in
studying
,
investigating
,
and
criticising
the ladies'
dresses
, might
as well be occupied in the
business
of a frizeur
or the man-millener; either of which would
afford
them more frequent opportunities for the
display
of their abilities, and render their labours
more
extensively
useful
to the
sex
. Others might
then improve the time, which
they
thus
frivolously
engrossed
on this
anniversary
, in contributing to
the entertainment of the
literati
, who
doubtless
expect to be gratified by the exertions of genius,
and an apparent
progress
in
those
studies
, which
are
designed
to qualify the
rising
youth of
America
for important
stations
both in church and
state
.
The
assembly
was extremely brilliant; the
ladies
seemed
to vie with each other in magnificent
decorations. So much
loveliness
was
visible
in
their native charms, that, without any hint from
the
speakers
of the day, I
should
have thought it
a pity to add
those
foreign ornaments, which
rather
obscure
than aid them.
I was a little
displeased
by the unbecoming
levity of
some
of my
sex
; and
apprehensive
left
it might induce misjudging and
censorious
people
to imagine that they were led thither more by
the vanity of attracting notice, than to receive
any mental entertainment.
Without our
consent
, we ran a race back to
town, which endangered our necks. The
avaricious
hackman,
desirous
of returning for another
freight, had no mercy on his
passengers
or
horses
.
However, we arrived
safely
, though much
fatigued
by the
pleasure
of the day.
Pleasure
carried to
excess
degenerates into pain.
This I actually experienced; and fighed for the
tranquil enjoyments of Harmony-Grove, to which
I
propose
soon
to return, and convince you how
affectionately I am your's.
ANNA WILLIAMS.
N
To
Miss
ANNA WILLIAMS.
Harmony-Grove
.
DEAR ANNA,
Your
enlivening letter
restored
us, in
some
measure
, to your
society
; or at
least
alleviated
the pain of your
absence
.
I am glad you attended Commencement. It
was a new
scene
, and
consequently
extended
your ideas. I think you rather
severe
on the
classical
gentlemen. We
simple
country-folks
must
not
presume
to arraign
their
taste
,
whose
learning and abilities render them
conspicuous
on the literary
stage
. They,
doubtless
, write on
subjects
best
adapted to their capacities. As for
the follies of
fashion
, I think the gentlemen are
under obligations to the ladies for adopting them;
since
it gives
exercise
to their genius and pens.
You were tired, you
say
, with
pleasure
. I
believe
those
dissipating
scenes
, which greatly
exhilarate
the
spirits
, call for the whole attention, and
oblige us to exert every power, are always
fatiguing
.
Pleasures
of a calmer kind, which are
moderately
enjoyed, which enliven rather than
exhaust
,
and which yield a
serenity
of mind on reflection,
are the
most
durable, rational, and
satisfying
.
Pleasure
is the
most
alluring object which is
presented
to the view of the young and
inexperienced
.
Under various forms it courts our
attention
;
but, while we are
still
eager in the
pursuit
,
it eludes our
grasp
. Its
fascinating
charms
deceive
the imagination, and create a bower of
bliss
in every
distant
object. But let us be careful not
to
six
our affections on any thing which bears
this name,
unless
it be founded on virtue, and
will endure the
severest
scrutiny
of examination.
Our honored mamma, and all your friends
here, are impatient for your return. They
unitedly
long to embrace, and bid you welcome to
these
seats
of
simplicity
and
ease
: but none more
ardently, than your affectionate
sister
,
MARIA WILLIAMS.
To
Miss
MATILDA FIELDING.
Boston
.
DEAR MATILDA,
Anxious
to make the
best
possible
use
of the education I have received; and fully
impressed
with the idea, that the human mind is
capable of continual improvements, it is my
constant
endeavour to extract honey from every
flower which falls in my way, or, to
speak
without
a figure, to derive advantage from every
incident
.
Pursuant
to the advice of our excellent
Preceptress
, I keep this perpetually in view;
and am therefore
disappointed
when defeated in
the attempt.
This afternoon I have been in company with
three ladies, celebrated for their beauty and wit.
One of them, I think, may
justly
claim the
reputation
of beauty. To a
finished
form, a fair
complexion, and an engaging, animating
countenance
are added. Yet a
consciousness
of
superior
charms was apparent in her deportment;
and a
supercilious
air counteracted the effects of
her
personal
accomplishments
. The two others
were evidently more indebted to art than to
nature
for their appearance. It might
easily
be
discovered
that paint
constituted
all the delicacy
of their complexion!
What a pity, that
so
many are deceived in their
ideas of beauty! Certain it is, that artificial
additions
serve
rather to impair than
increase
its
power. Who can paint like nature? What
hand is
skilful
enough to
supply
her defects?
Do not
those
who attempt it always fail, and
render
themselves
disgusting
? Do they not really
injure what they
strive
to mend; and make it
more indifferent than
usual
, when.
divested
of its
temporary
embellishments
? Beauty cannot
possibly
maintain its
sway
over its
most
obsequious
votaries,
unless
the manners and the mind
unitedly
contribute to
secure
it. How vain then is
this
subterfuge
! It may deceive the eye, and
gain the flattery of the prattling coxcomb; but
accumulated neglect and mortification inevitably
await
those
who
trust
in the wretched
alternative
.
From their good
sense
, I had been led to
expect the
greatest
entertainment. I therefore
waited impatiently till the
first
compliments were
over, and
conversation
commenced.
But, to my extreme regret, I found it to
consist
of ludicrous
insinuations
hackneyed
jests
, and
satirical
remarks upon others of their
acquaintance
who were
absent
. The pretty fellows of
the town were
criticised
; and their own
adventures
in
shopping
were related with
so
much
minuteness
,
hilarity, and glee, that I
blushed
for the
frivolous levity of
those
of my
sex
, who could
N 2
substitute
buffoonery for wit, and the
effusions
of
a perverted imagination for that refined and
improving
conversation
, which a well cultivated
mind and a correct
taste
are calculated to
afford
!
If,
said
I to
myself
, this be the beauty and
the wit of
polished
society
,
restore
me again to
the native
simplicity
and
sincerity
of
Harmony-Grove
!
I took my leave as
soon
as
politeness
would
allow; and left them to animadvert upon me.
Independent for
happiness
on the
praise
or
censure
of
superficial
minds, let me ever be
conscious
of meriting approbation, and I
shall
rest
contented
in the certain
prospect
of receiving it.
Adieu.
SOPHIA MANCHESTER.
To
Miss
SOPHIA MANCHESTER.
Beverly
.
I SYMPATHIZE with you, my dear
Sophia, in the
disappointment
you received in
your expectations from beauty and wit.
You may
nevertheless
derive advantage from
it. Your refined and delicate ideas
raise
you too
far above the
scenes
of common life. They paint
the defects of your inferiors in
such
lively
colours, that the greater part of the community
must
be
displeasing
to you. Few, you
should
remember, have had the advantages which you
have enjoyed; and
still
fewer have your
penetrating
eye, correct
taste
, and quick
sensibility
. Let
charity then draw a veil over the foibles of
others
,
and candour induce you to look on the
best
and
brightest
side
.
It is both our duty and
interest
to enjoy life,
as far as integrity and innocence allow; and, in
order to this, we
must
not
soar
above, but
accommodate
ourselves
to
its ordinary
state
. We
cannot
stem
the torrent of folly and vanity; but
we can
step
aside
and
see
it roll on, without
suffering
ourselves
to be borne down by the
stream
.
Empty
conversation
must
be
disgusting
to
every
rational and thinking mind; yet, when it
partakes not of malignity, it is
harmless
in its
effects
,
as the vapour which floats over the mead in
a
summer
's eve. But, when malice and envy
join to give
scope
to detraction, we ought to
avoid their contagion, and decidedly condemn
the
effusions
of the ill-natured merriment which
they
inspire
.
Our
sex
have been taxed as
desamers
. I am
convinced, however, that they are not
exclusively
guilty; yet, for want of more
substantial
matter
of
conversation
, I fear they too often give
occasion
for the
accusation
! A mind properly
cultivated
,
and
stored
with
useful
knowledge, will
despise
a
pastime
which
must
be
supported
at the
expense
of others. Hence only the
superficial
and the giddy are reduced to the
necessity
of
filling the time in which they
associate
together,
with the degrading and injurious
subjects
of
slander
. But I
trust
that our improved
country-women
are
rising
far
superior
to this
necessity
,
and are able to convince the world, that the
American fair are enlightened, generous, and
liberal. The
false
notions of
sexual
disparity
, in
point of
understanding
and capacity, are
justly
exploded; and each branch of
society
is uniting
to
raise
the virtues and
polish
the manners of
the whole.
I am, &c.
MATILDA FIELDING.
To
Miss
JULIA GREENFIELD.
Salem
.
DEAR JULIA,
From
your recommendation of Mrs.
Chapone's
letters; and, what is
still
more, from the
character given them by Mrs. Williams, I was
anxious to
possess
the book; but, not being able
to procure it here, my clerical brother, who was
fortunately going to
Boston
, bought and
presented
it to me.
I am much gratified by the perufal and flatter
myself
that I
shall
derive
lasting
benefit from it.
So intricate is the path of youth, and
so
many
temptations lurk around to beguile our feet
astray
,
that we really need
some
skilful
pilot to guide us
through the
delusive
maze. To an attentive and
docile mind, publications of this
sort
may afford
much
instruction
and aid. They ought,
therefore
,
to be carefully collected, and diligently
perused
.
Anxious to make my brother
some
acknowledgment
for his
present
, I wrought and
sent
him
a
purse
, accompanied with a dedication which I
thought might
amuse
some
of his
solitary
moments
;
and which, for that
purpose
, I here
transcribe
and convey to you.
THE
enclosed
, with zeal and with reverence due,
Implor'd my
permission
to wait upon you;
And begg'd that the
muse
would her favour extend,
To briefty her worth and her
service
commend.
The
muse
, who by dear-bought experience had known
How little her
use
to the clergy had grown,
With officious advice thus attack'd the poor
purse
:
Why, you novice! 'tis plain that you cannot do
worse
!
If the end of your being you would ever attain,
And honor,
preserment
, and influence gain,
Go quick to the pocket of
some
noble knave,
Whose
merit is wealth, and his
person
its
slave
:
Or enter the
mansion
, where
splendour
appears,
And pomp and eclat are the habit
she
wears:
Or hie to the court, where
so
well you are known,
So highly
esteem
'd and
so
confident grown,
That without your
assistance
and recommendation,
None claims any merit, or fills any
station
!
Seek either of
these
; and with joy you'll behold
Yourself
crown'd with honor, and filled with gold.
But to wait on a
priest
! How
absurd
is the
scheme
:
His reward's in
reversion
; the future's his theme.
Will
these
, for the
present
, your cravings
supply
;
Or
soften
the din of
necessity
's cry?
Of hunger and want the loud clamours repel;
Or
crush
the poor moth that would on you revel?
For poets and prophets, the world has decreed,
On fame and on faith may
luxuriously
feed!
Here the
purse
interpos'd with a
strut
and a
stare
,
Pray, good madam
muse
, your
suggestions
forbear!
On virtue and worth I'm
resolv
'd to attend,
A
firm
, if I am not a
plentiful
friend.
Tho not
swell
'd with gold, and with metal extended,
What little I have
shall
be rightly expended:
And a trifle, by
justice
and
wisdom
obtain'd,
Is better than millions
dishonestly
gain'd!
Yet I hope and
presume
, that I never
shall
be
Excluded his pocket for the lack of a fee!
Thus the
muse
and the
purse
till I took the direction,
And
destin
'd the latter to your kind protection.
My
wishes
attend her, with fervour
express
'd,
That in yellow or white
she
may always be
dress
'd;
And e'er have the power each dull care to beguile;
Make the
summer
more gay, and the bleak winter
smile
!
But if Fortune be blind; or
should
she
not favour
These
wishes
of mine, you
must
scorn
the deceiver;
And,
rising
superior
to all
she
can do,
Find a
bliss
more
substantial
than
she
can
bestow
!

DEAR LAURA,
I have
spent
a very agreeable
summer
in
the country; but am now preparing to return
to town. I anticipate, with
pleasure
, a
restoration
to your
society
, and that of my other friends
there. I
should
, however, quit
these
rural
scenes
with reluctance, were it not that they are giving
place to the chilling harbingers of approaching
winter. They have afforded charms to me,
which the giddy round of
fashionable
amusements
can never equal. Many, however, think
life
insupportable
, except in the
bustle
and
diffipation
of a city. Of this number is the volatile
Amelia Parr, whom you know as well as I. So
extreme is her gaiety, that the good qualities of
her mind are
suffered
to lie dormant; while the
most
restless
passions
are indulged without
restraint
.
I have
just
received a letter from her,
which you will
see
to be
characteristic
of her
disposition
. I
enclose
that, and my
answer
to it
for your
perusal
. Read both with candour; and
believe me ever your's.

Boston

Where
are you, Harriot; and what
are you doing? Six long months
absent
from
the town! What can you find to beguile the
tedious hours? Life
must
be a burden to you!
How can you employ
yourself
? Employ, did I
say
? Pho! I will not
use
so
vulgar a term! I
meant
amuse
!
Amusement
surely
is the prime
end of our
existence
! You have no plays, no
card-parties, nor
assemblies
that are worth
mentioning
!
Intolerably heavy
must
the lagging
wheels of time roll on! How
shall
I accelerate
them for you? A new novel may do
something
towards it! I accordingly
send
you one,
imported
in the
last
ships
. Foreign, to be
sure
;
else
it would not be worth attention. They have
attained to a far greater degree of refinement in
the old world, than we have in the new; and
are
so
perfectly acquainted with the
passions
,
that there is
something
extremely
amusing
and
interesting
in their plots and counter-plots,
operating in various ways, till the dear
creatures
are jumbled into matrimony in the
prettiest
manner that can be conceived!
We
, in this country, are too much in a
state
of nature to write good novels yet. An
American
O
novel is
such
a moral,
sentimental
thing,
that it is enough to give any body the vapours to
read one. Pray come to town as
soon
as
possible
,
and not dream away your
best
days in
obscurity
and
insignificance
.
But this boarding
school
; this
Harmony-Grove
,
where you formerly
resided
, has given
you
strange
ideas of the world. With what
raptures I have heard you relate the dull
scenes
in which you were concerned there! I am
afraid that your
diseased
taste
has now come to a
crisis
, and you have commenced prude in
earnest
!
But return to your city friends; and we will
lend our charitable
assistance
, in
restoring
you
to gaiety and
pleasure
.
AMELIA PARR.
The
Answer

Worcester
.
DEAR AMELIA,
Your
letteryour rattle, rather, came
to hand
yesterday
. I could not avoid
smiling
at
your erroneous opinions; and, in my turn, beg
leave to
express
my wonder at your
entertainments
in town. True, we have no plays. We
are not obliged by
fashion
to
sit
, half
suffocated
in a crowd, for the greater part of the night, to
hear the rantings, and
see
the extravagant actions
of the
buskin
heroes, (and
those
not always
consistent
with female
modesty
to
witness
!) We
have no card-parties, avowedly formed for the
purpose
of
killing time!
But we have an
agreeable
neighbourhood; among which we can
easily
collect a
social
circle; and
persons
of
taste
,
politeness
and information
compose
it. Here
we enjoy a rational and enlivening
conversation
,
which is at once refined and improving. We
have no
assemblies
,
composed
of a
promiscuous
crowd of gaudy belles and beaux; many of
whom we
should
despise
in a private company,
and deem unworthy our notice. But we have
genteel balls, the company of which is
select
,
none being admitted but
such
as do honor to
themselves
and each other. The
amusement
is
not protracted till the yawning
listlessness
of the
company proclaims their incapacity for
enjoyment
;
but we retire at a
seasonable
hour, and
add to the
pleasure
of the evening that of
undisturbed
rest
through the night. Of
course
, we
can
rise
with the fun, and
sip
the nectarious
dews,
wasted
in the aromatic gale. We
breakfast
before the heat of the day has brought on
a languor, and deprived us of appetite; after
which, we
amuse
ourselves
with our needles,
books, or
music
; recline on the
sofa
, or ramble
in the grove, as fancy or convenience directs.
In the
shady
bower we enjoy either the luxury
of
solitude
, or the
pleasures
of
society
; while
you are, the whole time, in the
midst
of hurry
and
bustle
. Eager in the
chase
,
you
fly from
one
scene
of
dissipation
to another; but the
fatigue
of this
ceaseless
round, and the exertion of
spirits
necessary
to
support
it, render the objects
of
pursuit
tasteless
and
insipid
.
Which mode of life, yours or mine, do you
now think the
most
rational, and productive of
the
greatest
happiness
? The boarding
school
,
which you affect to
despise
, has, it is true,
formed
my
taste
; and I flatter
myself
that I
shall
never
wish
it altered.
I
shall
soon
return to town; but not for
pleasure
.
It is not in crowds that I
seek
it. Adieu.
HARRIOT HENLY.
To
Miss
SOPHIA MANCHESTER.
Concord
.
DEAR SOPHIA,
Having
been with my aunt Burchel
for a fortnight
past
, I have indulged
myself
in
reading novels; with which her library is well
supplied
.
Richardson
's works have occupied a large
portion
of the time. What a
surprising
command
has this great
master
of the
passions
over our
feelings! It is happy for his own and
succeeding
ages, that he embarked in the
cause
of virtue.
For his influence on the affections of his readers
is
so
great, that it
must
have proved very
pernicious
,
had he
enlisted
on the
side
of vice. Though
I am not much of a novel reader, yet his pen
has operated like magic on my fancy; and
so
extremely
was I
interested
, that I could have
dispensed
with
sleep
or food for the
pleasure
I
found in reading him.
By this
circumstance
I am more than ever
convinced of the great caution which ought to
be
used
in
perusing
writings of the kind. How
secretly
, and how
insidiously
may they undermine
the fabric of virtue, by painting vice and folly in
the alluring colours, and with the lively
style
of
O 2
this ingenious author. The mind
should
be well
informed, and the judgment properly matured,
before young people indulge
themselves
in the
unrestrained
perusal
of them.
The examples of virtue and noble qualities,
exhibited by the author I have mentioned, are
truly
useful
; but every writer of novels is not a
Richardson
: and what dreadful effects might the
specious
manners of a Lovelace have on the
inexperienced
mind, were they not detected by a
just
exhibition of his vices!
The noble conduct of Clementina and
Miss
Byron are worthy of imitation; while the
indifcretion
of
Clarissa
, in putting
herself
under the
protection of a libertine, is a warning to every
fair. But both examples are often overlooked.
While the ear is charmed with the
style
, and
the fancy riots on the luxuriance of
description
,
which
so
intimately blend the charms of virtue
and the
fascinations
of vice; they are not
readily
distinguished
by all.
I am not equally
pleased
with all
Richardson
's
writings; yet
so
multifarious are his excellencies,
that his faults appear but
specks
, which
serve
as
soils
to
display
his beauties to better
advantage
.
Before I went from home I was engaged in
reading a
course
of
history
; but I fear I
shall
not return from this flowery field to the dry and
less
pleasing
path of more laborious
studies
.
This is one
disadvantage
of novel reading. It
dissipates
the ideas, relaxes the mind, and renders
it inattentive to the more
solid
and
useful
branches
of literature. Adieu.
LAURA GUILFORD.
To Mrs.
WILLIAMS.
Boston
.
DEAR MADAM,
Neither
change of place nor
situation
can alienate my affections from you, or obliterate
my grateful remembrance of your
kindness
.
Your admonitions and
counsels
have been the
guide of my youth. The many advantages
which I have already received from them, and
the
condescending
readiness
with which they
were always
administered
, embolden me to
solicit
your direction and advice in a
still
more
important
sphere
. The recommendation of my
parents and friends,
seconded
by my own
inclination
,
have induced me to yield my heart and
engage my hand to Mr. Sylvanus Farmington,
with
whose
character you are not unacquainted.
Next
Thursday
is the era fixed for our union.
O madam, how greatly
shall
I need a monitor
like you!
Sensible
of my own
impersections
, I
look forward with diffidence and
apprehension
,
blended with
pleasing
hopes, to this new and
untried
state
!
Your experienced pen can teach me how to
discharge
the duties, divide the cares, and enjoy
the
pleasures
, peculiar to the
station
on which I
am entering. Pray extend your benevolence,
and communicate your
sentiments
on female
deportment
in the connubial relation.
Practising
upon
such
a model, I may
still
be worthy the
appellation, which it will ever be my ambition
to
deserve
, of your affectionate friend and pupil,
HARRIOT HENLY.
To
Miss
HARRIOT HENLY.
Harmony-Grove
.
Indeed
, my dear Harriot, you are making
an important change of
situation
; a change
interesting
to you and your friends; a change
which involves, not only your own
happiness
,
but the
happiness
of the worthy man whom you
have
chosen
, of the family, over which you are
to
preside
, and perhaps, too, of that with which
you are to be connected.
I rejoice to hear that this connexion, on which
so
much depends, is not
hastily
formed; but
that it is the
result
of long acquaintance, is
founded on merit, and
consolidated
by
esteem
.
From characters like yours, mutually
deserving
and excellent, brilliant examples of conjugal
virtue
and felicity may be expected. Yet as
human
nature is imperfect, liable to errors, and apt
to deviate from the line of rectitude and
propriety
,
a monitorial guide may be expedient and
useful
. Your partiality has led you to
request
this
boon
of me; but diffidence of my own
abilities
compels me to decline the arduous
task
.
Nevertheless
, I have it happily in my power to
recommend an abler
instructor
, who has written
professedly
upon the
subject
. The
American
Spectator
, or
Matrimonial Preceptor
,
lately
published
by Mr. David
West
, of
Boston
,
contains all you can
wish
. The judicious
compiler
has collected and arranged his materials
with admirable
skill
and
address
.
Peruse
this
book, and you will be at no
loss
for
counsels
to
direct, and cautions to guard you through the
intricate cares and duties of the connubial life.
The
essays
are, chiefly, extracted from the
most
approved
English
writers. The productions of
so
many able pens, properly
disposed
, and
exhibited
in a new and agreeable light,
must
not
only be entertaining, but
useful
to every reader
of
taste
and judgment. I
wish
this publication
to be
considered
as a
necessary
piece of
furniture
by every
housekeeper
. The editor has
certainly
deserved
well of his country; and Hymen
should
crown him with unfading garlands.
I
shall
visit
you, my dear Harriot, after the
happy knot (for
such
I flatter
myself
it will
prove) is tied. In the mean time, I
subscribe
myself
, with the
most
ardent
wishes
for your
prosperity
and
happiness
, your
sincere
friend,
MARY WILLIAMS.
To
Miss
CLEORA PARTRIDGE.
Newbury-Port
.
What
think you of wit, Cleora? If you
estimate
it by the worth of your own, you think
it an invaluable jewel. But this jewel is
variously
set
. Yours is in the pure
sterling
gold of
good
sense
: yet, as
displayed
by
some
, it
glistens
on the mere
tinsel
of gaiety, which will not bear
the
scrutinizing
eye of judgment.
Yesterday
I received a
visit
from a young lady,
lately moved into this neighbourhood, who is
reputed
a wit. Her
conversation
reminded me of
Pope's
satirical
remark:
There are, whom Heaven has
bless
'd with
store
of wit;
But want as much again to manage it.
I found her's to
consist
in
smart
sayings
, lively
repartees, and ludicrous
allusions
.
So
strong
was her
propensity
to
display
this
talent, that
she
could not
resist
any temptation
which offered, though it led her to offend
against
the rules of
politeness
and
generosity
. As
some
persons
of real genius were
present
, topics of
literature and morality were
discussed
. Upon
these
she
was mute as a
statue
; but whenever
the
playfulness
of her fancy could find a
subject
,
she
was extremely loquacious. This induced me
to
suspect
that the brilliance of her imagination
had dazzled her
understanding
, and rendered her
negligent of the more
solid
and
useful
acquisitions
of the mind.
Is it not often the
case
, that
those
who are
distinguished
by any
superior
endowment,
whether
personal
or mental, are too much elated by the
consciousness
of their pre-eminence, and think it
sufficient
to counterbalance every deficiency?
This, Mrs. Williams
used
to
say
, is owing to
the want of
self
-knowledge; which, if once
possessed
,
will enable us properly to
estimate
our
own characters, and to
ascertain
with
precision
wherein we are defective, as well as wherein we
excel. But it is the misfortune of
us
, young
people, that we
seldom
attain this valuable
science
,
till we have experienced many of the ills
which
result
from the want of it. Ambition,
vanity, flattery, or
some
such
dazzling meteor,
engrosses
our attention, and renders us blind to
more important qualifications.
But to return to this
same
wit, of which I
was
speaking
. It is certainly a very dangerous
talent, when imprudently managed. None that
we can
possess
tends
so
directly to excite enmity,
or
destroy
friendship
.
An ill-natured wit is of all characters the
most
universally
dreaded. People of this
description
are always feared, but rarely loved. Humanity
and benevolence are
essentially
necessary
to
render
P
wit agreeable. Accompanied by
these
, it
cannot fail to
please
and entertain.
Wit, how delicious to man's dainty
taste
!
'Tis precious as the vehicle of
sense
;
But as its
substitute
, a dire
disease
!
Pernicious talent!
slatter
'd by mankind,
Yet hated too.
Sense
is the diamond, weighty,
solid
,
sound
:
When cut by wit, it
casts
a brighter beam;
Yet, wit apart, it is a diamond
still
.
Wit, widow'd of good
sense
, is
worse
than nought;
It
hoists
more
sail
to run
against
a rock.
But I believe I cannot give a better proof of
my own wit, than to conclude this
seribble
before
your patience is quite
exhausted
by the
perusal
.
Adieu.

Miss
HARRIOT HENLY.
Harmony-Grove

DEAR HARRIOT,
The
first
moment which I have been able
to
snatch
from the affectionate embraces of my
honored mamma, and my dear
sister
Maria, is
devoted to you. Judging by the anxious
solicitude
of my own heart, I know you are impatient
to hear of my
safe
arrival. It is
needless
to tell
you how cordially I was received. You have
witnessed
the mutual
tenderness
which actuates
our
domestic
circle. Where this is the
governing
principle, it is peculiarly
interesting
to
sensibility
.
It is extremely exhilarating to the mind
to
revisit
, after the
shortest
absence
, the place of
our nativity and juvenile
happiness
. There is
something
so
seducing
in that
spot
, in which we
first
had our
existence
, that nothing but it can
please
. Whatever
vicissitudes
we experience in
life, however we toil, or
wheresoever
we
wander
,
our fatigued
wishes
still
recur to home for
tranquillity. We long to die in that
spot
which
gave us birth, and in that
pleasing
expectation
opiate every calamity.

Goldsmith
.
The
satisfaction
of returning home, however,
has not obliterated the
pleasure
which I enjoyed
on my
visit
to you. Does not a change of
scene
and
situation
contribute to the
happiness
of life?
The natural love of this variety
seems
wisely
implanted
in the human
breast
; for it enables us to
accommodate
ourselves
with facility to the
different
circumstances
in which we are placed. I
believe
that no
pleasures
make
so
deep an
impression
on the memory, as
those
of the
first
and
most
innocent period of our lives. With what apparent
delight do
persons
, advanced in years, re-trace
their puerile feats and
diversions
! The hoary
head looks back with a
smile
of complacency,
mixed
with regret, on the
season
when health glowed
on the cheek, when lively
spirits
warmed the heart,
and when toil
strung
the nerves with vigour.

The
pleasures
of childhood and youth, when
regulated by parental
wisdom
, and
sweetened
by
filial affection and obedience,
must
be grateful to
the recollection at any age: and for this plain
reason
,
because
innocence and
simplicity
are their
leading traits. How
soothing
, how animating,
then,
must
be reflection, at the evening of a life,
wholly
spent
in virtue and rectitude!
Pope
observes
that Every year is a critique
on the
last
. The man
despises
the boy, the
philosopher
the man, and the
Christian
all. Happy
are
those
who can take a
retrospect
of all, with
the
supporting
consciousness
, that each part has
been rightly performed! Adieu.
ANNA WILLIAMS.
To
Miss
MATILDA FIELDING.
Boston
.
I am
impatient for an opportunity of
returning
your civilities, my dear Matilda; and if
possible
, of repaying you
some
part of the
pleasure
,
which you
so
liberally afforded me, during
my late
visit
to your
hospitable
mansion
. For
this
purpose
, I
must
insist
on the performance of
your
promise
to
spend
the winter in town. It is
true that I cannot contribute to your
amusement
in kind. Yet, according to the generally received
opinion, that variety is
necessary
to the
enjoyment
of life, we may find
our's
mutually
heightened
by the exchange. Delightful rambles, and
hours of contemplative
solitude
, free from the
interruptions of formality and
fashion
, I cannot
insure
; but you may depend on all that
friendship
and
assiduity
can
substitute
; and while the
bleak winds are howling abroad, a cheerful
fireside
,
and a
social
circle, may
dispel
the gloom of
the
season
. The
pleasures
of our family are very
local. Few are
sought
, in which the
understanding
and affections can have no
share
. For this
reason
, a
select
, not a
promiscuous
acquaintance
is cultivated. And however
unfashionable
our
practice may be deemed, we can find
entertainment
,
even in the dull hours of winter, without
recourse
to cards.
Almost
every other
recreation
P 2
affords
some
exercise
and improvement to
the body or mind, or both; but from this
neither
can
result
. The whole attention is
absorbed
by the game.
Reason
lies dormant, and the
passions
only are awake. However little is
depending
,
the parties are frequently as much agitated
by hope and fear, as if their all were at
stake
.
It is difficult for the
vanquished
not to feel
chagrin
;
while the victors are gratified at the
expense
of their friends. But the principal objection
with me, is the utter
exclusion
of
conversation
;
a
source
of
pleasure
, and of profit too, for which
I can admit nothing as an equivalent. Winter
evenings are peculiarly adapted to this rational
and refined entertainment. Deprived of that
variety
of
scenery
, and
those
beauties of nature,
which the vernal and autumnal
seasons
exhibit,
we are obliged to have
recourse
to the fire-
side
for comfort. Here we have
leisure
to collect
our
scattered
ideas, and to improve, by
social
intercourse
, and the exertion of our mental
powers.
Our
sex
are often rallied on their volubility:
and, for
myself
, I frankly
confess
, that I am
so
averse
to taciturnity, and
so
highly prize the
advantages
of
society
and
friendship
, that I had
rather plead guilty to the charge than
relinquish
them.
Hast
thou no friend to
set
thy mind a-broach?
Good
sense
will
stagnate
. Thoughts
shut
up, want air,
And
spoil
, like bales unopen'd to the
sun
.
Had thought been all,
sweet
speech
had been deny'd;
Speech thought's canal! Speech, thought's criterion too.
Thought, in the mine, may come forth gold or
dross
;
When coin'd in word, we know its real worth:
If
sterling
,
store
it for thy future
use
;
Twill buy thee benefit, perhaps renown.
Thought, too, deliver'd, is the more
possess
'd;
Teaching, we learn; and giving, we retain
The births of intellect: when dumb, forgot.
Speech ventilates our intellectual fire;
Speech
burnishes
our mental magazine;
Brightens for ornament, and whets for
use
.
Come then, Matilda, participate the
pleasures
,
and accelerate the improvement, of your
affec-tionate
friend,
LAURA GUILFORD.
To
Miss
LAURA GUILFORD.
Beverly
.
DEAR LAURA,
Your
's of the 9th ult. has
just
come to
hand. It gave me renewed experience of the
truth of the
observation
, that next to the
personal
presence
and
conversation
, is the
epistolary
correspondence
of a friend. I am preparing,
with the
most
lively
sensations
of
pleasure
, to
gratify my own
wishes
, and comply with your
polite invitation. The romantic beauty of the
rural
scenes
has
forsaken
me; and what can
so
amply
compensate
for their
absence
, as the charms
you offer?
I envy you nothing which the town affords,
but the advantages you derive from the choice of
society
adapted to your own
taste
. Your
sentiments
of the
fashionable
diversion
of
card-playing
,
are, in my view, perfectly
just
. I believe
that many people join in it,
because
it is the
ton
,
rather than from any other motive. And as
such
persons
generally pay the
greatest
deference
to Lord
Chesterfield
's opinions and maxims, I
have often wondered how they happened to
overlook, or
disregard
his
animadversions
upon
this
subject
; and have felt a
strong
inclination
to tell them, that this
all-
accomplished
master
of
politeness
, and oracle of
pleasure
,
expressly
says
,
All
amusements
, where neither the
understanding
nor the
senses
can have the
least
share
,
I look upon as frivolous, and the
resources
of
little minds, who either do not think, or do not
love to think.
We had a pretty party here,
last
evening; and
a party it literally was; for it
consisted
entirely
of ladies. This
singular
circumstance
was
remarked
by one of the company, who, at
least
,
pretended to think it agreeable,
because
,
said
she
, we can now
speak
without
restraint
, or
the fear of
criticism
. I
confess
that I was not
prude enough to
acquiesce
in her opinion.
Ladies of delicacy and refinement will not
countenance or
support
a
conversation
, which
gentlemen of
sense
and
sentiment
can
disapprove
.
As each were formed for
social
beings, and
depend
on the other for
social
happiness
, I imagine
that
society
receives its
greatest
charm from a
mutual interchange of
sentiment
and knowledge.
Both
sexes
are reciprocal
instruments
of each
other's improvement. The rough
spirit
of the
one is tempered by the
gentleness
of the other,
which has
likewise
its obligations to that
spirit
.
Men's
sentiments
contract a milder turn in the
company of women, who, on the other hand,
find their volatility abated in that of the men.
Their different qualities, intermingling, form a
happy
symphony
. From their intimate
conjunction
,
their real advantages
must
be common and
inseparable
; and as for
those
ridiculous
wranglings
about
superiority
, they may be reckoned
insults
to nature, and betray a want of a due
sense
of its
wise
and gracious
dispensations
.

The Ladies' Friend.
Many ladies affect to think it
inconsistent
with
female
reserve
, to acknowledge
themselves
pleased
with the company of the other
sex
; but while
such
are the objects and advantages of a mixed
society
, I
blush
not to own
myself
desirous
of its
custivation
. Adieu.
MATILDA FIELDING.
To
Miss
CAROLINE LITTLETON.
Boston
.
DEAR CAROLINE,
I take
the liberty to
send
you Bennet's
Letters. When my mamma put them into my
hand, Sophia,
said
she
, I recommend this book
to your attentive
perusal
. It highly
deserves
it,
and will richly reward your labour. You have,
indeed, completed your
school
education; but
you have much yet to learn. Improvements
in knowledge are
necessarily
progressive
. The
human mind is naturally active and eager in
pursuit
of information; which we have various
and continual means of accumulating: but never
will
you
have a more favourable opportunity for
the cultivation of your mind, than you now
enjoy. You are now free from
those
domestic
cares and avocations, which may hereafter fall
to your lot, and occupy
most
of your time.
Speculation
must
then give place to practice.
Be affiduous, therefore, to
increase
the
sund
, that
it may yield you a competent
interest
, and afford
you a
constant
resource
of
support
and
enjoyment
.
With
these
words
she
withdrew, while I was
still
listening
to the
sweet
accents of maternal
tenderness
and
discretion
, which vibrated on my
ear, even after her departure.
I find it worthy the recommendation of
so
good a judge. As a moral writer, the precepts
and
observations
of its author are excellent; as a
religious one, his piety is exemplary, and his
instructions
improving. His
selection
of books,
which he deems
most
proper for our
sex
, though
too numerous, perhaps, may,
notwithstanding
,
assist
and direct the young, in their
course
of
reading.
Who would not imitate his
Louisa
? In her
he has forcibly
displayed
the beauties of an
amiable
disposition
, and the advantages which
even
that
may derive from a virtuous and
religious education.
These
letters are not
scholastic
and elaborate
dissertations
; they are
addressed
to the heart;
they are the native language of affection: and
they can hardly fail to
instil
the love of virtue
into every mind
susceptible
of its charms.
If you have not read them, I will venture to
predict that they will afford you entertainment,
as well as
instruction
; and if you
have
, they will
bear a
second
perusal
. Indeed, every valuable
book
should
be re-
perused
. On a
first
reading,
our
curiosity
to know
something
of all it contains,
hurries us forward with a rapidity which
out-strips
both the memory and judgment.
When this predominant
passion
is gratified, an
attentive review will commonly
furnish
many
useful
and important
lessons
, which had nearly
or quite
escaped
our notice before.
This, by
some
, is deemed too laborious a
task
.
They prefer company and
conversation
to
reading
of any kind; and allege, in defence of their
opinion, that a knowledge of the world, and of
human nature, together with that
ease
and
gracefulness
of manners, which are of the
utmost
consequence
to all who would make a
respectable
figure in life, are much better obtained in this
way, than by the cold and
unimpassioned
perusal
of books.
But is not every
acquisition
of this
sort
merely
superficial
? Need we not a guide,
superior
to
our own judgment and experience, to point out
the line of duty and propriety, in the various
conditions and relations of our
existence
?
Our acquaintance with living characters and
manners can afford us but a very limited view of
mankind, in the different periods and
stages
of
society
. The
inquisitive
mind labours to extend
its knowledge to the
most
distant
climes and
remote
antiquity; and craves other materials for
the
exercise
of its reflecting powers, than can be
derived from
occasional
and
desultory
conversation
.
Now, by what means can this laudable
curiosity
be
so
effectually
satisfied
, as by the
perusal
of judicious and well
chosen
books? Not
that I would depreciate the value of good
company
(for I
esteem
it highly;) but add its many
Q
advantages to
those
which reading affords. This
combination
must
have a happy tendency to give
us
possession
, both of the virtues and graces;
and to render our attainments at once
solid
and
ornamental.
What think you, Caroline? Do you agree
with me in opinion? Let me hear from you
by the
first
opportunity; and believe me your's
most
sincerely
.
SOPHIA MANCHESTER.
To
Miss
SOPHIA MANCHESTER.
Newbury-Port
.
I thank
you, my dear friend, for the
book you were
so
obliging as to
send
me; and
for the letter which accompanied it. The book
I had read; but, as you
justly
observe
, I
must
be a gainer by a
second
perusal
.
Upon the
subject
of reading, I perfectly
accord
with you in
sentiment
. It is an
amusement
,
of which I was always
enthusiastically
fond.
Mrs. Williams regulated my
taste
; and, by
directing
and maturing my judgment, taught me
to make it a
source
of refined and
substantial
pleasure
. I do not
wish
to
pursue
study
as a
profession
, nor to become a learned lady; but I
would pay
so
much attention to it, as to
taste
the
delights of literature, and be qualified to bear a
part in rational and improving
conversation
.
Indeed, I would
treasure
up
such
a fund of
useful
knowledge, as may properly direct my
course
through life, and prove an antidote
against
the
vexations and
disappointments
of the world. I
think, Sophia, that our
sex
stand
in
special
need
of
such
a
resource
to beguile the
solitary
hours
which a
domestic
station
commonly
imposes
. Is
it not for want of this that
some
females
furnish
a pretext for the
accusation
(which is illiberally
brought
against
all) of having
recourse
to
scandal
,
and the
sallies
of indelicate mirth?
Conversation
requires a perpetual
supply
of materials
from the mind: and, accordingly as the mind has
been cultivated or neglected, dignified or
degrading
subjects
will be introduced.
I received a letter,
yesterday
, from our lively
and lovely friend, Anna Williams. How
delightfully
blended in this charming girl, are vivacity
and
sentiment
,
ease
and propriety. Adieu.
CAROLINE LITTLETON.
To
Miss
MARIA WILLIAMS.
Boston
.
So
often, my dear Maria, has the pen of the
divine, the
moralist
, and the
novelist
been
employed
on the
subject
of female frailty and
seduction
;
and
so
pathetically has each
described
the
folly and
misery
of the fatal
delusion
which
involves
many in
disgrace
, that I am
astonished
when I
see
those
, who have the
best
means of
information
,
heedlessly
sacrificing
their reputation,
peace and
happiness
, to the
specious
arts of the
libertine! In this
case
, it is common for our
sex
to rail
against
the other, and endeavour to excite
the pity of the world by painting the advantage
which has been taken of their credulity and
weakness
. But are we not
sufficiently
apprised
of the enemies we have to encounter? And have
we not adequate motives to
circumspection
and
firmness
?
I am generally an advocate for my own
sex
;
but when they
suffer
themselves
to fall a prey to
seducers
, their
pusillanimity
admits no
excuse
. I
am bold to affirm that every woman, by behaving
with propriety on all
occasions
, may not only
resist
temptation, but repel the
first
attempts upon
her honor and virtue.
That levity of deportment, which invites and
encourages
designers
, ought
studiously
to be
Q 2
avoided. Flattery and vanity are two of the
most
dangerous foes to the
sex
. A
fondness
for
admiration
insensibly
throws them off their guard,
and leads them to
listen
and give credit to the
prosessions
of
those
who lie in wait to deceive.
The following remarks, though
severe
,
perhaps
,
can hardly be deemed
inconsistent
with the
character which their author
assumes
.
[5]
[5]
The Ladies' Friend.
Women
would do well to forbear their declamations
against
the
falsity
and
wickedness
of men; the
fault is theirs, to fall into
such
coarse
-
spun
snares
as are laid for them.
That
servile
obsequiousness
which women
should
immediately look upon as the mark of fraud,
and which
should
make them apprehend a
surprise
,
is the very thing which allures them, and renders
them
soon
the victims of perjury and
inconstancy
;
the
just
punishment
of a
disposition
which
fixes their inclinations on
superficial
qualities. It
is this
disposition
which draws after them a crowd
of empty fops, who, if they have any meaning at
all, it is only to deceive. Something
pleasing
in
a man's
person
, a giddy air, a perpetual levity,
supply
the place of valuable endowments.
A recent, and
singular
adventure has rendered
observations
of this
sort
peculiarly
striking
to
my mind; which may account for the
subject
and the length of this letter.
I will give you a detail of it, though I
must
conceal the real names of the parties concerned.
Yesterday
, the weather being very fine, and
the
sleighing
excellent,
several
of our family,
with two or three friends, were induced to make
an
excursion
a few miles into the country. We
stopped
at a
house
which had formerly been a
tavern, and in which we had often been well
entertained
on
similar
occasions
. As we were in
haste
to receive the benefit of a good fire, we
did not notice the removal of the
sign
, nor advert
to the
possibility
of its being converted to a
private
mansion
. Being very cold, I
stepped
first
out of the
sleigh
, and ran
hastily
in; leaving the
gentlemen to
exercise
their gallantry with the
other ladies. The room I entered had no fire.
I therefore opened the door which led to the
next apartment, when I beheld the beautiful and
admired Clarinda
sitting
in an
easy
chair, pale
and wan, with an infant in her arms! I
stood
mute and
motionless
, till the woman of the
house
appeared to conduct me to another room.
Confusion
and
shame
were
visibly
depicted in
Clarinda's
countenance; and, unable to meet my
eye,
she
threw her handkerchief over her face,
and fell back in her chair.
I followed the good woman, and, apologizing
for my
intrusion
, told her the
cause
. She
recollected
my having been there before, and
readily
excused
my freedom.
By this time the
rest
of the company, who
had been
shown
into a decent parlour, were
inquiring
for me; and I could
scarcely
find
opportunity
to
request
my
conductress
to
ask
Clarinda's
forgiveness
in my name, and to
assure
her of my
silence
, before I had joined them. I
assumed
an
appearance of
cheerfulness
very foreign to the
feelings of my heart, and related my
mistake
without any mention of the melancholy
discovery
I had made. We prevailed on the woman
to accommodate us with tea and coffee, as we
wished
to ride no further. While preparations
were making,
she
came in to lay the table, and
as
she
withdrew gave me a token to follow her;
when
she
informed me that Clarinda had been
extremely overcome by my detecting her
situation
;
but being
somewhat
recovered,
desired
a
private interview. I accordingly repaired to her
apartment, where I found her bathed in tears.
Pity operated in my
breast
, and with an air of
tenderness
I offered her my hand; but
she
withheld
her's, exclaiming in broken accents, O no!
I am pollutedI have forfeited your
friendship
I am unworthy even of your
compassion
!
I begged her to be calm, and
promised
her
that
she
should
suffer
no inconvenience from my
knowledge of her condition.
She thanked me for my
assurances
, and
subjoined
that,
since
she
knew the candour and
generosity
of my
disposition
,
she
would
entrust
me
with every
circumstance
relative to her
shameful
fall; when, after a
considerable
pause
,
she
proceeded
nearly in the following words.
Though our acquaintance has been for
some
time
suspended
, and though we have lived in
different parts of the town, yet common
same
has
doubtless
informed you that I was
addressed
by the gay, and to me, too charming Florimel!
To the
most
captivating form, he
superadded
the winning graces of
politeness
, and all
those
insinuating
arts which imperceptibly engage the
female heart.
His flattering attentions, and apparent ardour
of affection were to my inexperienced and
susceptible
mind proofs of his
sincerity
; and the
effusions
of the
most
lively
passion
were returned
with
unsuspecting
confidence.
My father,
strict
in his principles, and
watchful
for my real welfare,
disapproved
his
suit
;
alleging
that although Florimel was calculated to
please
in the gayer moments of life, he was
nevertheless
destitute
of
those
sentiments
of religion
and virtue, which are
essentially
requisite
to
durable
felicity. But I could not be
persuaded
that he lacked any perfection which maturer
years would not give him; and therefore finding
my attachment unconquerable, my father
reluctantly
acquiesced
in the
proposed
connexion.
My ill-judged partiality for this ungenerous man
absorbed
every other
passion
and
pursuit
; while
he took advantage of my yielding
fondness
, and
assumed
liberties which I knew to be
inconsistent
with delicacy, but had not
resolution
to repel.
One encroachment
succeeded
another, and every
concession
was claimed and granted as a proof of
love, till at length he became
absolute
master
of
my will and my
person
! Shame and
remorse
soon
roused
me to a
sense
of my guilt, and I
demanded
an immediate performance of his
promise
of marriage. This, under one pretext or
another
,
he
constantly
evaded. His
visits
daily
became
less
frequent, and his attentions
less
assiduous
;
while the
most
poignant
anguish
of mind
deprived me of every comfort. I found
myself
reduced to the humiliating alternative of
entreating
my
seducer
to
screen
me from infamy by the
name of wife, though he
should
never
consider
or treat me as
such
. To this he
insultingly
replied
,
that my
situation
must
necessarily
detect
our illicit commerce; and his pride could never
brook the reputation of having a wife
whose
chastity
had been
sacrificed
. As
soon
as rage
and
resentment
, which at
first
took from me the
power of utterance, would permit, Wretch!
exclaimed
I, is it not to you the
sacrifice
has been
made? Who but you has triumphed over my
virtue, and
subjected
me to the
disgrace
and
wretchedness
I now
suffer
? Was it not in token
of my regard for you that I yielded to your
solicitations
?
And is this the requital I am to
receive
?
Base
, ungrateful man! I
despise
your
meanness
! I
detest
the ungenerous
disposition
you betray, and henceforth reject all
intercourse
and
society
with you! I will throw
myself
on
the mercy of my injured parents, and renounce
you forever.
Seeing me
almost
frantic, he endeavoured to
soothe
and
appease
me. He apologized for the
harshness
of his language, and even made
professions
of unabated affection; but gave as a
reason
for deferring the conjugal union, at
present
,
that commercial affairs obliged him to
sail
immediately
for Europe;
assuring
me at the
same
time that on his return he would not fail to
renew
and
consummate
the connexion. To this I
gave no credit, and therefore made no reply.
He then
requested
me to accept a
purse
to
defray
my
expenses
, during his
absence
, which I
rejected with
disdain
; and he departed. The
distress
and
despair
of my mind were
inexpressible
.
For
some
days, I
resigned
myself
entirely
to the agonizing pangs of grief. My parents
imputed my dejection to Florimel's departure,
and
strove
to
console
me. It was not long,
however, before my mother
discovered
the real
cause
. In her,
resentment
gave place to
compassion
;
but the anger of my father could not
be
appeased
. He
absolutely
forbad me his
presence
for
some
time; but my mother at length
prevailed on him to
see
, and
assure
me of
forgiveness
and
restoration
to favour, if I would
consent
to renounce and
disown
my child; to
which, not then knowing the force of maternal
affection, I readily
consented
. This place was
privately procured for me, and hither, under
pretence of
spending
a month or two with a
friend in the country, I retired. To-morrow my
dear babe is to be taken from me! It is to be
put to
nurse
, I know not where! All I am told
is, that it
shall
be well taken care of!
Constantly
will its moans haunt my imagination, while I
am deprived even of the hope of
ministering
to
its wants; but
must
leave it to execrate the hour
which gave it birth, and deprived it of a parent's
attention and
kindness
.
As
soon
as
possible
, I
shall
return to my
father's
house
; and as I am unknown here, and
you are the only
person
, out of our family, who
shares
the dreadful
secret
, I flatter
myself
that my
crime may
still
be concealed from the world.
The reproaches of my own mind I can never
escape
.
Conscious
guilt will give the
aspect
of
accusation
to every eye that beholds me; and
however policy may compel me to wear the
mask
of gaiety and
ease
, my heart will be wrung
with
inexpressible
anguish
by the remembrance
of my folly, and always alive to the
distressing
sensations
of
remorse
and
shame
! Oh Julia!
you have
witnessed
my
disgrace
! pity and
forgive
me! Perhaps I once appeared as virtuous
and
respectable
, as you now do; but how
changed! how fallen! how
debased
! Learn
from my fate to
despise
the flattery of the
worthless
coxcomb, and the arts of the abandoned
libertine.
By this time I was
summoned
to tea; when,
giving all the
consolation
in my power to the
unhappy Clarinda, I rejoined my company; and
to prevent their
inquisitiveness
about my
absence
,
told them I had been with a
sick
woman,
upon whom I accidentally intruded when I
first
came in; and that
she
had detained me, all this
time, by a recital of her complaints and
misfortunes
.
This account
satisfied
their
curiosity
;
but the melancholy into which my mind had
been thrown was not
easily
dissipated
; nor could
I, without doing violence to my feelings, put on
the appearance of my
usual
cheerfulness
and
case
.
Here, my dear Maria, is a picture of the
frailty
and
weakness
of our
sex
! How much
reason
have we then to watch and pray that we enter
not into temptation!
With affectionate regards to your mamma and
sister
, I
subscribe
myself
your's
most
sincerely
,
JULIA GREENFIELD.
R
To
Miss
JULIA GREENFIELD.
Harmony-Gaovz

MY DEAR FRIEND,
I was
much affected by the woe-fraught
tale which you gave me in your
last
. We
cannot
too much regret that
such
instances
of
duplicity
and folly are ever exhibited. They are
alike
disgraceful
to both
sexes
, and
demonstrate
the
debasing
and fatal tendency of the
passions
,
when
suffered
to predominate.
Your
observations
upon our
sex
I believe to be
just
, though many would probably deem them
severe
. However, I think it not much to the
honor of the
masculine
character, which the God
of nature
designed
for a defence and
safeguard
to female virtue and
happiness
, to take advantage
of the tender affection of the
unsuspecting
and
too credulous fair; and, in return for her love
and confidence,
perfidiously
to
destroy
her peace
of mind, and deprive her of that reputation,
which might have rendered her a
useful
and
ornamental
member of
society
. True, we ought
to take warning by
such
examples of treachery
and deceit; yet, how much more conducive to
the honor and
happiness
of our
species
, were
there no
occasion
to apprehend
such
ungenerous
requitals of our
sincerity
and
frankness
!
Yesterday
, my mamma took the liberty to read
that part of your letter, which contains the
story
of Clarinda, to her pupils, and to make
such
comments upon it as the
subject
suggested
;
during
which we could not but
observe
the extreme
emotion of one of the miffes, a
most
amiable
girl of about
sixteen
. When the paragraph
respecting
Clarinda's
disowning
her child was read,
she
hastily
rose
, and in broken accents begged
leave to withdraw. This was granted, without
any inquiry into the
cause
; though our
curiosity
,
as you may well
suppose
, was much excited.
After we were
dismissed
, my mamma prevailed
on her to tell the
reason
of her agitation.
I am,
said
she
, the illegitimate offspring
of parents, whom I am told are people of fortune
and
fashion
. The fear of
disgrace
overcame
the dictates of natural affection, and induced my
mother to abandon me in my infancy. She
accordingly
gave me away, with a large
sum
of money,
which
she
vainly imagined would procure me
kind and good treatment. But, unhappily for
me, the people to whom I was
consigned
,
availing
themselves
of their
security
from
inspection
and inquiry,
abused
the
trust
reposed
in them,
and
exposed
me to the
greatest
hardships
. As
they were
persons
of vulgar minds and unfeeling
hearts, they did not
commiserate
my
friendless
condition. My quick
sensibility
incurred their
displeasure
or
derision
. I was often
insultingly
reproached with the misfortune of my birth;
while the tears which
these
ungenerous
reflections
extorted from me, were either mocked or
punished
. I had a
thirst
for knowledge; but
they allowed me no time for acquiring it,
alleging
that they could not
support
me in
idleness
,
but that I
must
earn my living, as they did their's,
by hard labour.
Oppressed
by
these
insults
, I
bore the galling yoke of their authority with the
utmost
impatience. When
screened
from
observation
,
my tears
slowed
without
restraint
; and
the idea of my parents' cruelty, in thus
subjecting
me to infamy and
wretchedness
, continually
haunted my imagination. Sometimes I fancied
my mother in view, and,
exposing
my tattered
raiment,
expostulated
with her concerning the
indignities I
suffered
, and the
unreasonable
hardship
of leaving me to bear all the
punishment
of
my guilty birth! At other times I painted to
myself
a father, in
some
gentleman of
pleasing
aspect
; and fondly indulged the momentary
transport
of throwing
myself
at the feet of one, whom
I could call by that venerable and endearing
name! Too
soon
, however, did the
reverse
of
parental
tenderness
awake me from my
delusive
reveries.
In this manner I lingered away my
existence
,
till I was twelve years old; when going,
one day, to the
house
of a gentleman in the
neighbourhood, to which I was often
sent
to
sell
herbs, and other trifles, I was directed into the
parlour, where the
most
beautiful
sight
in nature
opened to my view; while the
contrast
between
my own
situation
, and that of children
blessed
with affectionate parents, gave me the
most
painful
sensations
. The lady of the
house
was
surrounded
by her four
sons
, the
eldest
of whom
was reading
lessons
, which
she
most
pathetically
inculcated upon all. As the door was open, I
stood
some
minutes
unobserved
; and was
so
delighted
with the tender accents in which her
instructions
were imparted, and the cheerful
obedience
with which they were received, that I had
no
disposition
to interrupt them.
At length I was
seen
, and bid to come in.
But, when
questioned
about my errand, I was
so
absorbed
in the contemplation of maternal and
filial love, exhibited in this happy group, that my
tongue
refused
utterance, and I
burst
into tears.
The children gathered around, and inquired what
ailed the poor little girl? But when the lady
took me by the hand, and kindly
asked
what
was the matter, I could not
restrain
or conceal
my feelings. When my tears had relieved me, I
related the
cause
of my grief;
describing
my
own
situation
, and the effect which its
contrast
had produced on my mind.
She was affected by my
story
, and
seemed
pleased
with my
sensibility
; while the children
lamented my misfortunes, and
artlessly
requested
R 2
their mamma to let me come and live with
them.
Little did I then expect
so
great a favour;
but to my
surprise
, as well as joy, Mrs. ,
the lady of whom I have been
speaking
, and by
whom I am put under your care, came, a few
days after, and
asked
the people where I lived, if
they were willing to part with me. By their
consent
she
took me home, and has ever
since
treated me like a child.
I am now happy beyond
expression
. My
gratitude to my
benefactress
, who, guided by a
wife and good Providence, has
snatched
me from
obscurity
and
misery
, and given me
so
many
advantages
for improvement, is unbounded.
But the idea that any
helpless
innocent
should
be unnaturally
exposed
to the
sufferings
which I
have experienced, is
insupportably
distressing
to
my imagination.
Let my
story
, if
possible
, be told to Clarinda,
that
she
may be induced to have
compassion
upon
her
defenceless
offspring.
You are at liberty, therefore, my dear Julia,
to make what
use
you
please
of this letter. I
shall
make no comments upon the
subject
of it,
nor add any thing more to its length, but that I
am affectionately your's.
MARIA WILLIAMS.
To
Miss
ANNA WILLIAMS.
Salem
.
DEAR ANNA,
My
contemplated
visit
to Harmony-Grove
must
be deferred. A
severe
illness
has lately
confined
my mamma to her chamber. This claimed
all my time and attention, and called me to a new
scene
of care; that of a family, which I was
obliged
to
superintend
during her
indisposition
. Her
recovery has, at length,
restored
tranquillity and
joy to our abode; but
she
has not yet
resumed
the
direction of her
household
affairs. To this,
she
tells me,
she
is reconciled by the hope, that
experience
may render me an adept in
domestic
economy
.
Indeed, Anna, I think this an
essential
branch of female education; and I
question
whether it can be acquired by mere
speculation
.
To me it is plain, that every lady ought
to have
some
practice in the management of a
family, before
she
takes upon
herself
the
important
trust
.
Do not many of the
mistakes
and infelicities of
life
arise
from a deficiency in this point?
Young ladies of
fashion
are not obliged to the
task
, and have too
seldom
any inclination to
perform
duties which require
so
much time and
attention
;
and with which, perhaps, they have
injudiciously
been taught to connect the idea of
fervility. Hence it is, that when called to
preside
over families, they commit many errors, during
their novitiate, at
least
, which are alike
detrimental
to their
interest
and
happiness
. How
necessary
is it, then, to avoid this complication of evils
by a
seasonable
application to
those
offices of
housewifery
, which may one day become our
province.
Early
rising
, I find a great
assistance
in my
present
occupation. It is
almost
incredible how
much may be gained by a diligent improvement
of
those
hours which are but too commonly
lost
in
sleep
. I
arose
this morning with the dawn.
The
serenity
of the
sky
and the fragrance of the
air invited me abroad. The
calmness
which
universally
prevailed
served
to tranquillize my mind,
while the receding
shades
of night, and the
rising
beams of day formed a
contrasted
assemblage
of
the beautiful, the
splendid
, the
solemn
n, and the
sublime
. The
silence
which pervaded the
surrounding
scenery
was interrupted only by the
melody of the feathered
songsters
, who
seemed
to
rejoice in this
undisturbed
opportunity of
praifing
their Maker. My heart expanded with
gratitude
and love to the all-bountiful Author of
nature
;
and
so
absorbed
was I in the
most
delightful
meditations, that I
saw
with regret the hour
approaching which
must
again call me to the
active
duties of
domestic
and
social
life.
These
,
however
,
are objects of real moment, and cannot
innocently
be
disregarded
. They give a
relish
to
amusement
, and even to devotion, which
neither
the
dissipated
nor the
recluse
can know.
Adieu.
CLEORA PARTRIDGE.
To
Miss
HARRIOT HENLY.
Beverly
.
DEAR HARRIOT,
I SINCERELY thank you for your
affectionate
letter, by the
last
post
, and for the book
with which it was accompanied. The very title
is
sufficient
to
rouse
the feelings and attract
the attention of the patriotic mind. Beacon-Hill
claims a
conspicuous
place in the
history
of our
country. The
subject
of this poem
must
be
highly
interesting
to every true American; while
the genius it
displays
cannot fail to gratify every
poetical
taste
. Philenia's talents
justly
entitle
her to a rank among the literary ornaments of
Columbia.
I have been reviewing Millot's Elements of
Ancient
and Modern
History
; and recommend it to
your re-
perusal
. It is undoubtedly the
most
useful
compendium extant. The tedious
minuteness
and prolix details of
sieges
and battles,
negociations
and treaties, which fatigue the reader
and
oppress
the memory, in
most
works of the
kind, are happily avoided in this; while the
elegance
,
simplicity
,
conciseness
and
perspicuity
of
the
style
, render it intelligible to every capacity,
and
pleasing
to every
taste
. To
those
who have
a
relish
for
history
, but want
leisure
to give it
full
scope
, Millot is well calculated to afford both
information and entertainment. It is an
objection
,
commonly made by our
sex
to
studies
of
this nature, that they are dry and elaborate; that
they yield little or no
exercise
to the more
sprightly
faculties of the mind; that the attention is
confined to an
uninteresting
and barren detail of
facts, while the imagination pants in vain for the
flowery wreaths of decoration.
This is a
plausible
excuse
for
those
who read
only for
amusement
, and are willing to
sacrifice
reason
, and the enlargement of their minds, to
the gaudy phantom of a day; but it can never
be
satisfactory
to the
person
, who
wishes
to
combine utility with
pleasure
, and dignity with
relaxation.
History
improves the
understanding
,
and
furnishes
a knowledge of human nature and
human events, which may be
useful
, as well as
ornamental, through life.
History
,
says
the
late celebrated Ganganelli, brings together all
ages and all mankind into one point of view.
Presenting
a charming
landscape
to the mental
eye, it gives colour to the thoughts,
soul
to the
actions, and life to the dead; and brings them
again upon the
stage
of the world, as if they were
again living; but with this difference, that it is
not to flatter, but to judge them.
The duties and avocations of our
sex
will not
often admit of a
close
and connected
course
of
reading. Yet a general knowledge of the
most
necessary
subjects
may undoubtedly be gained,
even in our
leisure
hours; provided we
bestow
them not on works of mere
taste
and fancy, but
on the
perusal
of books calculated to enrich the
understanding
with durable
acquisitions
.
The
sincerest
wishes
for your health and
happiness
glow in the
breast
of your affectionate
MATILDA FIELDING.
To
Miss
MARIA WILLIAMS.
Boston
.
MY DEAR MARIA,
Since
I wrote you
last
, I have made an
agreeable
visit
to my good friend, Sylvia Star.
After rambling in the fields and gardens till we
were fatigued, we went into her brother's library.
He was in a
studious
attitude, but gave us a
polite
reception. We are come to
solicit
a portion
of your
repast
, Amintor,
said
I. Be
so
kind as
to
furnish
us with
some
instructive
page, which
combines entertainment and utility; and while it
informs the mind, delights the imagination. I
am not happy enough to know your
taste
respecting
books,
said
he; and, therefore, may not make
a proper
selection
. Here, however, is an author
highly
spoken
of by a lady, who has lately added
to the number of literary publications; handing
me Sterne's Sentimental Journey. I
closed
and
returned the book. You have indeed
mistaken
my
taste
,
said
I. Wit, blended with indelicacy,
never meets my approbation. While the fancy
is allured, and the
passions
awakened, by this
pathetic
humourist
, the foundations of virtue are
insidiously
undermined, and
modest
dignity
insensibly
betrayed. Well,
said
he,
similing
, perhaps
you are
seriously
inclined. If
so
, this volume of
sermons
may
possibly
please
you. Still
less
,
rejoined
S
I. The
serious
mind
must
turn with
disgust
from the levity which pervades
these
discourses
,
and from the indecent flow of mirth and
humour, which converts even the
sacred
writings
,
and the
most
solemn
subjects
of religion,
into frolic and buffoonery. Since
such
is your
opinion of this celebrated writer,
said
he, I will
not
insult
your feelings by offering you his
Tristram
Shandy. But here is another wit, famous
for his
purity
. Yes,
said
I, if
obscene
and
vulgar
ideas, if ill-natured remarks and filthy
allusions
be purity, Swift undoubtedly bears the palm
from all his contemporaries. As far as
grammatical
correctness
and
simplicity
of language can
deserve
the epithet, his advocates may enjoy their
sentiments
unmolested
; but, in any other
sense
of the word, he has certainly no claim to
purity
.
I conceive his works,
notwithstanding
, to be
much
less
pernicious in their tendency, than
those
of Sterne. They are not
so
enchanting in
their nature, nor
so
subtle
in their effects. In the
one, the noxious
insinuations
of licentious wit
are concealed under the artful
blandishments
of
sympathetic
sensibility
; while we at once recoil
from the rude affault which is made upon our
delicacy, by the
roughness
and vulgarity of the
other.
Choose
then,
said
Amintor, for
yourself
. I
availed
myself
of his offer, and
soon
fixed my
eyes upon Doctor Belknap's
History
of
New-Hampshire
,
and American Biography; both of
which I have
since
read with the
greatest
satisfaction
.
By this judicious and impartial
historian
, we
are led, from its
first
settlement
, to trace the
progress
of the infant colony. We accompany
its inhabitants in their enterprizes, their dangers,
their toils, and their
successes
. We take an
interest
in their
prosperity
; and we tremble at the
dreadful outrages of the barbarous foe. Our
imagination
is again recalled to the gradual advance
of population and agriculture. We behold the
wilderness
blooming as the
rose
, and the haunts
of
savage
beasts
, and more
savage
men,
converted
into fruitful fields and
pleasant
habitations.
The arts and
sciences
flourish
; peace and
harmony
are
restored
; and we are
astonished
at
the amazing
contrast
, produced in little more
than a
single
century!
When we turn to the American Biography,
gratitude glows in our
bosoms
towards
those
intrepid
and active adventurers, who
traversed
a
trackless
ocean, explored an unknown region,
and laid the foundation of empire and
independence
in this
western
hemisphere
. The
undaunted
resolution
, and cool, determined
wisdom
of
Columbus, fill us with profound admiration. We
are
constrained
to pay a tribute of
just
applause
to the
generosity
of a female mind, exemplified
in
Isabella
, who, to
surmount
every
obstacle
, no
bly
consented
to
sacrifice
even her
personal
ornaments
to the
success
of this glorious expedition.
The daring
spirit
of Captain Smith, and the
prudence, policy, and magnanimity of his
conduct
to the treacherous natives, and to his
equally
treacherous and ungrateful countrymen,
exhibit
an example of
patriotism
and moderation,
which at once commands our
applause
, and
interests
our feelings. While we tremble and
recoil
at his dreadful
situation
, when bending his
neck to receive the murderous
stroke
of death,
the native virtues of our
sex
suddenly
reanimate
our frame; and, with
sensations
of rapture, we
behold
compassion
, benevolence, and humanity
triumphant even in a
savage
breast
; and
conspicuously
displayed
in the conduct of the
amiable
,
though uncivilized Pocahontas! Nor are
the other characters in this work
uninteresting
:
and I am happy to find that the
same
masterly
pen is
still
industriously
employed for the public
good;
[6]
[6]
How vain are our expectations! While the types were
setting
for this very page, Dr. Belknap
suddenly
expired in
a fit.
and that a
second
volume of American
Biography is now in the
press
.
In reviewing this letter, I am
astonished
at my
own
presumption
, in undertaking to play the
critic. My imagination has
outstripped
my
judgment; but I will
arrest
its career, and
subscribe
myself
most
affectionately your's.
SOPHIA MANCHESTER.
To
Miss
ANNA WILLIAMS.
Boston
.
DEAR ANNA,
I retired
, after
breakfast
this morning,
determined to indulge
myself
in my favourite
amusement
, and write you a long letter. I had
just
mended my pen and folded my paper, when
I was informed that three ladies waited for me
in the parlour. I
stepped
down and found
Lucinda
P, Fulvia F, and Delia S.
They were gaily
dressed
, and
still
more gaily
disposed
.
We called,
said
they, to invite you,
Miss
Maria, to join our party for a
shopping
tour. Loath to have the ideas
dissipated
, which
I had collected in my pericranium, for the
purpose
of
transmitting
to a beloved
sister
, I
declined
accepting their invitation; alleging that I had
no
occasion
to
purchase
any thing to-day; and
therefore begged to be
excused
from
accompanying
them. They laughed at my
reason
for not
engaging in the expedition. Buying,
said
their
principal
speaker
, is no
considerable
part of our
plan, I
assure
you.
Amusement
is what we are
after. We frankly acknowledge it a delightful
gratification of our vanity, to
traverse
Cornhill,
to receive the
obsequious
congees, and to call
forth the gallantry and activity of the beaux
behind
the counter; who, you
must
know, are
extremely
S 2
alert when we belles appear. The
waving
of our feathers, and the attractive airs we
assume
,
command the
profoundest
attention, both
of
master
and apprentices; who, duped by our
appearance,
suffer
less
brilliant
customers
to wait,
or even to depart without notice, till we have
tumbled over and
refused
half the goods in the
shop
. We then bid a very civil adieu;
express
our regret at having given
so
much trouble; are
assured
, in return, that it has been rather a
pleasure
;
and leave them their labour for their pains.
A
most
insignificant
amusement
this,
said
I
to
myself
I How little can it redound to the
honor and
happiness
of
these
unthinking girls,
thus to
squander
their time in folly's giddy
maze! They undoubtedly
wish
to attract eclat;
but they would do well to remember
those
words
of the
satirist
, which, with the alteration of a
single
term, may be applied to them:
Columbia's
daughters, much more fair than nice.
Too fond of admiration,
lose
their price;
Worn in the public eye, give cheap delight
To throngs, and
tarnish
to the
sated
sight
.
Viewing their conduct in this light, I
withstood
their
solicitations
, though I palliated my
refusal
in
such
a manner as to give no umbrage.
Of all expedients to kill time, this appears to
me, as I know it will to you, the
most
ridiculous
and
absurd
.
What
possible
satisfaction
can
result
from
such
a practice? It certainly fatigues the body; and
is it any advantage to the mind? Does it enlarge
the
understanding
,
inspire
useful
ideas, or
furnish
a
source
of
pleasing
reflection? True, it may
gratify a vitiated imagination, and exhilarate a
light and trifling mind. But
these
ought to be
restrained
and regulated by
reason
and judgment,
rather than indulged.
I
wish
those
ladies, who make
pleasure
the
supreme
object of their
pursuit
, and argue in
vindication
of their conduct, that
Pleasure
is good, and
they
for
pleasure
made,
would confine
themselves
to that
species
which
Neither
blushes
, nor expires.
The
domestic
virtues, if duly cultivated, might
certainly occupy
those
hours, which they are now
solicitous
to diffipate, both with profit and delight:
But it is time enough to be
domesticated
,
say
they, when we are placed at the head of
families
,
and
necessarily
confined to care and labour.
Should not the mind, however, be
seasonably
inured to the
sphere
of life which Providence
affigns us?
To guide the pencil, turn th'
instructive
page;
To lend new flavour to the fruitful year,
And heighten nature's dainties; in their race
To rear their graces into
second
life;
To give
society
its
highest
taste
;
Well-ordered home man's
best
delight to make;
And, by
submissive
wisdom
,
modest
skill
,
With every gentle care-cluding art,
To
raise
the virtues, animate the
bliss
,
And
sweeten
all the toils of human life:
This be the female dignity and
praise
.
A proper attention to
these
necessary
duties
and
embellishments
would not only correct this
rambling
disposition
, but happily leave neither
leisure
nor temptation for its indulgence.
I intended to have given you
some
account of
my agreeable
visit
here; but the
chit-chat
of the
ladies I have mentioned, has occupied a large
portion of my time this morning, and an
engagement
to dine abroad claims the
rest
.
I hope
soon
to embrace you in our beloved
retirement
,
and again to enjoy the
sweets
of my
native home.
Had I the choice of
sublunary
good,
What could I
wish
that I
possess
not there?
Health,
leisure
, means t' improve it,
friendship
, peace.
My
most
dutiful affections await mamma; and
my kind regards attend the young ladies
residing
with her. How great a
share
of my ardent love
is at your command need not be renewedly
testified
by
MARIA WILLIAMS.
To
Miss
SOPHIA MANCHESTER.
Newbury-Port
.
The
extracts which you
transmitted
to
me in your
last
kind letter, my dear Sophia, from
your favourite author, Doctor Young,
corresponded
exactly with the
solemnity
infused
into
my mind by the funeral of a neighbour, from
which I had
just
returned.
I agree with you, that the Night-Thoughts are
good devotional
exercises
. It is
impossible
to
read them with that degree of attention which
they merit, without being affected by the
important
and awful
subjects
on which they treat.
But Young, after all, is always too
abstruse
, and
in many
instances
, too gloomy for me. The
most
elaborate application is
necessary
to the
comprehension
of his meaning and
design
;
which, when
discovered
, often tend rather to
depress
than to elevate the
spirits
.
Thompson
is much better adapted to my
taste
. Sentiment, elegance,
perspicuity
, and
sublimity
are all combined in his
Seasons
. What
an inimitable painter! How admirably he
describes
the infinitely variegated beauties and
operations
of nature! To the feeling and
susceptible
heart they are
presented
in the
strongest
light. Nor is the energy of his language
less
perceivable, when he
describes
the Deity riding
on the wings of the wind, and directing the
stormy
tempest
.
How chang'd the
scene
! In blazing height of noon,
The
sun
,
oppress
'd, is plung'd in
thickest
gloom;
Still horror reigns, a
dismal
twilight round,
Of
struggling
night and day malignant mix'd.
Far to the hot equator crowding
fast
,
Where, highly rarefy'd, the yielding air
Admits their
stream
,
incessant
vapours roll,
Amazing clouds on clouds continual heap'd;
Or whirl'd
tempestuous
by the
gusty
wind,
Or
silent
, borne along, heavy and
slow
,
With the big
stores
of
streaming
oceans charg'd.
Meantime, amid
these
upper
seas
,
condens
'd
Around the cold arial mountain's brow,
And by conflicting winds together
dash
'd,
The thunder holds his black tremendous throne.
From cloud to cloud the rending lightnings rage;
Till, in the furious elemental war
Dissolv
'd, the whole precipitated
mass
Unbroken floods and torrents pours.
Conscious
of our own
weakness
and
dependence
,
we can hardly fail to adore and to fear
that Divine Power,
whose
agency this imagery
exhibits to our minds. Nor are the devout
affections
of our hearts
less
excited, when we
behold
the
same
glorious Being arrayed in love,
and accommodating the regular
succession
of
summer
and winter,
seed
-time and
harvest
to our
convenience and comfort. When nature,
obedient
to his command, revives the vegetable
world, and
diffuses
alacrity and joy throughout
the animal, and even rational creation, we
involuntarily
exclaim with the poet,
Hail, Source of Being! Universal Soul
Of heaven and earth!
Essential Presence
, hail!
To
Thee
I bend the knee; to
Thee
my thoughts
Continual climb; who, with a
master
hand,
Hast
the great whole into perfection touch'd.
By
Thee
the various vegetative tribes,
Wrapt in a filmy net, and clad with leaves,
Draw the live ether, and imbibe the dew.
By
Thee
,
dispos
'd into congenial
soils
,
Stands each attractive plant, and
sucks
, and
swells
The juicy tide; a twining
mass
of tubes.
At
Thy
command, the vernal fun awakes
The torpid
sap
, detruded to the root
By wintry winds; which now in fluent dance,
And lively fermentation, mounting,
spreads
All this innumerous-colour'd
scene
of things.
Aided in our
observations
by this pathetic and
pious writer, our hearts beat
responfive
to the
sentiments
of gratitude, which he indirectly, yet
most
forcibly inculcates in that devout
address
to
the Supreme Parent:
Were every faultering tongue of man,
Almighty Father
!
silent
in thy
praise
,
Thy works
themselves
would
raise
a general voice,
Even in the depth of
solitary
woods,
By human foot untrod; proclaim thy power,
And to the quire
celestial
Thee
resound
,
Th' eternal
Cause
, Support, and End of all!
By this beautiful poem we are allured to the
study
of nature, and to the contemplation of
nature's
God. Our hearts glow with devotion and
love to the
sovereign
Lord and Benefactor of the
universe
; and we are drawn, by the innumerable
displays
of his
goodness
, to the practice of virtue
and religion.
You may,
possibly
, call me an
enthusiast
.
Be it
so
. Yet I contend for the honor, but
especially
for the privilege, of being a cheerful one.
For I think we
dishonor
our heavenly Father by
attaching any thing gloomy or forbidding to his
character. In the participation of divine
blessings
,
let us rather
exercise
a thankful, and
contented
disposition
.
I remain your's
most
affectionately.
CAROLINE LITTLETON.
To Mrs.
WILLIAMS.
Boston
.
DEAR MADAM,
By
her
desire
, in conjunction with my own
inclination, I inform you that Harriot Henly is
no more
Yesterday
she
gave her hand, and
renounced her name together; threw
aside
the
sprightly
girl we have been
so
long
accustomed
to admire, and
substituted
in her place the
dignified
and
respectable
head of a family, in Mrs.
Farmington.
Have I not
lost
my amiable friend and
associate
?
Will not her change of
situation
tend to
lessen
our
intercourse
, and to alienate our
affections
?
When I contemplate the
social
circle,
so
firmly
cemented in the bands of
friendship
, at the
boarding
school
, where the
most
perfect
harmony
,
ease
and
satisfaction
presided
, I recoil at
the idea of becoming
less
dear,
less
interesting
,
and
less
necessary
to each other. It is with the
utmost
reluctance that I admit the idea of rivals
to that affection and benevolence which we have,
so
long, and
so
sincerely
interchanged.
The charm however is broken. Harriot is
already
married; and my friends are extremely
solicitous
that I
should
follow her example. But
in a connexion which requires
so
many
precautions
T
before it is formed, and
such
uninterrupted
circumspection
and prudence afterwards;
the great uncertainty of the event
inspires
me
with timidity and
apprehension
.
Harriot put into my hands, and I read with
pleasure
, the book which you recommended to
her on the
subject
. But
still
we
wished
for your
instruction
and advice. The
sentiments
of a
person
so
dear and
interesting
to us, are
particularly
calculated to engage our attention, and
influence
our conduct. Relying, too, on your
judgment and experience, your forming pen may
render us more worthy objects of attachment.
We, however, unite in
assuring
you of our
gratitude for all
past
favours; and in
presenting
our
sincere
regards to the young ladies.
I am, with great
respect
, your affectionate
and grateful
LAURA GUILFORD.
To
Miss
LAURA GUILFORD.
Harmony-Grove
.
DEAR LAURA,
The
obligations under which you lay me,
by your generous confidence, and affectionate
expressions
of regard, induce me again to
assume
the
Preceptress
towards you, and to gratify your
wishes
, by imparting my
sentiments
on your
present
situation
and
prospects
.
I am told by my daughter, who had the honor
of bearing your letter, that you are, what I
always
expected you would be, an object of
general
admiration. Yet, I
trust
, your good
sense
will enable you duly to
distinguish
and treat the
several
candidates for your favour.
It is, indeed, my young friend, a matter of the
most
serious
consequence
, which lies upon your
mind, and awakens your anxiety. Your friends
are
studious
of your welfare, and kindly concerned
that the important die on which the
happiness
of
your life depends,
should
be
judiciously
cast
. You
doubtless
remember, that I
discoursed
upon this
subject
in my concluding
lessons
to your
class
.
Disparity
of tempers, among other things which
were then
suggested
, and which you will
doubtless
recollect, was
represented
, as tending to render
life uncomfortable. But there are other
disparities
which may be equally
hostile
to your peace.
Disparity
of years is very apt to
occasion
the
indulgence of
passions
destructive
of conjugal
felicity
.
The great difference between the
sprightly
fancy, vivacity, and enterprize of youth, and
the deliberate caution, phlegmatic
coldness
, and
sententious
wisdom
of age, render them very
unpleasant
companions to each other. Marriage
between
persons
of
these
opposite
descriptions
is
commonly the
result
of pecuniary motives, with
one party, at
least
: the
suspicion
of this, in the
other,
must
necessarily
produce
discontent
,
uneasiness
,
and
disaffection
.
Age is naturally jealous of
respect
, and
apprehensive
of being
slighted
. The
most
trifling and
unmeaning inattentions will therefore be
construed
amiss
. For an
excessive
desire
of being objects
of
supreme
regard is
almost
invariably
accompanied
with a
strong
persuasion
of being the
reverse
.
Hence
accusations
, reproaches, and
restraints
, on
the one
side
, produce
disgust
,
resentment
and
alienation
on the other, till mutual and
unceasing
wretchedness
ensue
. Indeed, where
interest
alone, without this inequality of years, is the
principal inducement, marriage is
seldom
happy.
Esteem
and love are independent of wealth and
its appendages. They are not to be fold or
bought. The conjugal relation is
so
near and
interesting
;
the mind, as well as the
person
, is
so
intimately concerned in it, that
something
more
substantial
and engaging than gold is
requisite
to
make it a
blessing
.
Marriage, being the commencement of a
domestic
life,
beside
the many agreeable
circumstances
attending it, has its peculiar cares and
troubles, which require the
solace
of a
companion
actuated by better principles, and
possessed
of
more amiable endowments than outward
splendour
and magnificence can afford. In the hour
of
sickness
and
distress
, riches, it is true, can
bestow
bodily comforts and cordials; but can they
be made an equivalent for the tender
sympathy
,
the endearing
kindness
, and the alleviating
attention
of a
bosom
friend, kindly
assiduous
to
ease
our pains, animate our
prospects
, and beguile the
languid moments which elude all other
consolations
?
The
sorrows
as well as the joys of a
family
state
, are often
such
as none but a
bosom
friend can participate. The heart
must
be
engaged
before it can
repose
with
ease
and confidence.
To a lady of
sensibility
, the confinement of the
body, without the
consent
and union of
according
minds,
must
be a
state
of
inexpressible
wretchedness
.
Another
situation
, not
less
to be deplored, is a
connexion with the immoral and profane.
How
shocking
must
it be, to hear that
sacred
NAME, which you revere and love,
constantly
treated with levity and irreverence! And how
painful the
necessity
of being
constrained
, for the
T 2
sake
of peace, to
witness
in
silence
, and without
even the appearance of
disapprobation
, the
most
shameful
outrages upon religion and virtue! May
you never
taste
the
bitterness
of this evil!
Intemperance is a vice, which one would
imagine
no lady would overlook in a
suitor
. But,
strange
to tell! there are
those
, even among our
own
sex
, who think and
speak
of inebriation in
the other, at the jovial and well-
furnished
board,
as a mark of conviviality and good
fellowship
!
What, then, is the
distinguishing
badge of
humanity
?
Can that
reason
, which alone
raises
us
superior
to the brute creation, be wantonly
sacrificed
with impunity; yea, with reputation?
How degrading and how dreadful
must
this
enormity appear to an
interested
, affectionate,
and virtuous wife! What agonizing pangs of
mortification and
anguish
must
she
endure, when
she
meets him, in
whose
society
she
delights,
whose
return
she
has anticipated with impatience, and
whose
happiness
and honor are the moving
springs
of her life, intoxicated with wine; the powers of
his mind
suspended
by the
poisonous
cup, and
every faculty
absorbed
in the deadly draught!
What a perpetual
source
of dread and
apprehension
must
hence
arise
; and how often
must
the
blush
of indignant virtue and wounded delicacy
be called forth!
The
gamester
is an equally dangerous
companion
.
His family is robbed, not only of his company
and his talents, but of that property, to the
benefit
of which they have an
indisputable
claim.
His earnings are
squandered
among
worthless
and
profligate
associates
abroad; while the faithful
partner of his life, and perhaps, too, a
rising
offspring
,
languish
at home for want of bread!
How fatal is the tendency of
such
examples!
How can that father inculcate the duties of
piety
,
virtue and decency, who exhibits the
reverse
of each in his own conduct? And under what
an
unspeakable
disadvantage
must
that mother
labour, in the
instruction
and education of her
children,
whose
admonitions,
counsels
, and
directions
are practically counteracted by him who
ought to bear an equal
share
of the burden!
The government and
superintendence
of a
family
are objects of
such
magnitude and
importance
,
that the union and co-operation of its
heads are
indispensably
necessary
. It is a little
commonwealth; and if internal feuds and
dissensions
arise
, anarchy and
confusion
must
ensue
.
Domestic
happiness
is the foundation of every
other
species
. At times, indeed, we may enjoy
ourselves
abroad, among our friends; but a good
heart will return home, as to the
seat
of felicity.
Home is the
resort
Of love, of joy, of peace and plenty, where,
Supporting and
supported
,
polish
'd friends
And dear relations mingle into
bliss
.
Since
so
much, then, depends upon a judicious
choice, how important is it, that you examine
well before you decide; and that you
dispense
with no quality in the man to whom you
shall
give your hand, which is
essential
to the virtue
and
happiness
of your life. For this
purpose
,
consult
your judgment, rather than your fancy;
and
suffer
not
superficial
accomplishments
, but
solid
merit to preponderate.
I have now endeavoured to point out the
most
apparent and threatening dangers to which
you may be
exposed
. But though
these
are
avoided, many
unforeseen
accidents will
doubtless
occur to cloud your
sanguine
hopes.
These
,
when there are no vices to produce them, may
arise
from follies, and from the indulgence of
erroneous
expectations. Little
misunderstandings
sometimes
occasion
disagreements
which
terminate
in
coldness
and
disaffection
, and plant a
root of
bitterness
which can hardly be eradicated.
Let prudence, therefore, be your pole-
star
,
when you enter the married
state
. Watch with
the
greatest
circumspection
over
yourself
; and
always
exercise
the
tenderest
affection, the
most
unwearied patience, and the
most
cheerful
acquiescence
in the treatment of your companion.
Guard
especially
against
being affected by
those
little inattentions and foibles, which too often
give pain and umbrage without
design
; and
produce
those
remonstrances
, criminations, and
retorts, which are the great inlets of
strife
, and
bane of love.
You
must
bear, with
calmness
, every thing that
the
sincerest
desire
of peace can dictate; and
studiously
avoid every
expression
, and even look,
which may irritate and offend. Your own
happiness
,
you will
consider
so
intimately connected
with that of your
husband
, as to be
inseparable
;
and
consequently
, that all your hopes of comfort
in this life, and perhaps, too, in the next, depend
upon your conducting with propriety and
wisdom
towards him.
I take the liberty, through you, to convey my
congratulations to Mrs. Farmington. May her
change of condition be happy, to the full extent
of our
most
sanguine
expectations, and
benevolent
wishes
. I fully intended writing her on
the
subject
, but have unwarily
bestowed
so
much
time upon you, that for the
present
, I
must
fore-go
the
pleasure
. Some things in this letter,
which you will
doubtless
communicate, are
applicable
to her
case
.
These
she
will receive as
friendly hints from me; and I am confident that
her known
discretion
will continue to
shed
a
benign
and engaging influence upon her whole
deportment
,
and render her uniformly
respected
and beloved.
The bearer is waiting, and I can only add,
that I remain your
sincere
and affectionate friend.
MARY WILLIAMS.
To
Miss
CLEORA PARTRIDGE.
Boston
.
DEAR CLEORA,
The
pleasing
hope with which you
inspired
me, when we parted
last
, of receiving a
visit
from you in town, has been
constantly
cherished
. I have anticipated your arrival with
the
utmost
impatience; but have endeavoured,
notwithstanding
, to beguile the
slow
-paced hours
by a
useful
and
pleasing
occupation; the
revision
of my geographical
studies
.
My papa has kindly procured me Doctor
Morse
's
last
, and much improved edition of
Universal
Geography, which, with the
assistance
of
a pair of globes he
possessed
, has afforded me the
most
delightful entertainment. When at
school
,
I thought this the
most
agreeable
study
allotted
me; never deeming it a
task
, but an
amusement
.
It affords me, as it
must
every true American,
the
sincerest
pleasure
to be
furnished
with the
means of acquiring this favourite
science
, by my
own countryman; and the
spirit
of Columbian
independence exults in my
bosom
, at the idea of
being able to gain an accurate acquaintance with
my own and other countries, without
recourse
to
the labours of foreigners.
I think the
present
generation under
special
obligations to the active
industry
of Dr.
Morse
,
in providing us with that
necessary
and rich fund
of information, which his Geography and
Gazetteer
contain. From
these
sources
we may
derive
a
sufficient
knowledge of the world we
inhabit
,
without departing from our
domestic
sphere
.
Come, then, my dear Cleora, and without
fatigue
or
expense
, we will make the tour of the
globe together. After
investigating
the local
situation
of different and
distant
climes, we will
turn to the
historic
page, and examine the
manners
,
government, character, and improvements
of their inhabitants. We will
traverse
the frozen
wastes
of the frigid zones, and the burning
sands
of the equatorial region; then return and
bless
the temperate and happy medium in which we
are placed; and,
casting
an eye around, exult in
our peculiar advantages of
soil
and
situation
,
peace and good government, virtue and religion.
The fine mornings of this
season
afford many
delightful hours, before the heat of the day
relaxes
the mind and enervates the body. Come,
then, enjoy and improve
these
, in concert with
your faithful and affectionate friend,
JULIA GREENFIELD.
To
Miss
MATILDA FIELDING.
Harmony-Grove
.
DEAR MATILDA,
Last
Thursday
, after having concluded
the
usual
occupations and
sedentary
amusements
of the day, I walked out, towards evening, to
enjoy the benefit of a cool and fragrant air, and
the
serenity
and beauty of
those
rural
scenes
which have a powerful tendency to
soothe
and
tranquillize the mind. When I had rambled in
the fields, to a
considerable
distance
, I
crossed
into the road, to return home free from the
inconvenience
of the dew, which had begun to fall.
I had not proceeded far, when I
observed
a
female, who had the appearance of youth and
misfortune,
sitting
by the wall in a
pensive
attitude
,
with an infant in her lap. When I
approached
her,
she
arose
, and in the
most
humble
and pathetic accents,
besought
me to direct her
to
some
shelter
, where
she
might
repose
her
weary limbs for the night. The
aspect
and
language
of
distress
awakened my
compassion
. To
know
she
really needed charity, was a
sufficient
inducement with me to
bestow
it, without
scrupulously
inquiring whether
she
deserved
it or
not. I therefore told her to follow me, and I
would conduct her to a lodging.
As we walked on, I
questioned
her
respecting
the place of her nativity, her parentage, and the
reason
of her being reduced to the
situation
in
which I had found her. She informed me that
she
was born in Ireland; that her parents
brought her into this country, before her
remembrance
;
that while
she
was very young, they
both died, and left her to the protection and
mercy of
strangers
; that
she
was bandied from
one to another, in the village where Providence
had
cast
her lot, till
she
was able to earn her
own living: and
since
that time,
said
she
, I
believe the character of an
honest
and
industrious
girl will not be
refused
me. How then,
said
I, came you by this incumbrance? pointing
to the child. In that, replied
she
, I am
verily guilty. Brought up in ignorance of
those
principles of decency, virtue and religion, which
have kept
you
innocent, Madam, I was ruined by
a deceitful man, who, under the
mask
of love,
and with the
most
solemn
promises
of
marriage
,
betrayed my confidence, and left me to
reap the bitter fruits of my credulity. The
woman where I lived, when
she
discovered
my
situation
, ordered me to leave her
house
immediately
.
It was no matter,
said
she
, how much I
suffered
, or what became of me. On my own
head,
she
told me, my iniquity
should
fall;
she
would not lighten the burden, if it were in her
power.
Some of the neighbours informed me, that
she
had
reason
to be
severe
upon my fault, being
once in the
same
condemnation
herself
.
U
Having no friend who could
assist
me, I
applied
to the
selection
of the town, who provided
for me till I was able to work, and then told me
I
must
shift
for
myself
; offering, however, to
keep the child, which I
refused
, being determined
it
should
never
suffer
for want of a mother's care,
while I had life.
I am now wandering in
pursuit
of
employment
,
that the labour of my hands may
support
myself
and little one. This has been often
denied
me, either for fear my child
should
be
troublesome
, or
because
my character was
suspected
.
I have
sometimes
suffered
so
much
from fatigue and want, that I have
despaired
of
relief, and heartily
wished
both
myself
and my
babe in the grave.
On examination, I found her knowledge
confined
entirely to
domestic
drudgery; that
she
had
never been taught either to read or write. She
appears,
notwithstanding
, to have good natural
sense
; and a
quickness
of
apprehension
, and
readiness
of
expression
,
seldom
equalled in her
sphere
of life.
I conducted her into the kitchen, and
desired
she
might have
supper
, and a bed provided for
her. My mamma,
whose
benevolent heart and
liberal hand are always ready to relieve the
necessitous
,
was
pleased
to approve my conduct; and
having kept her through the next day, and
observed
her
disposition
and behaviour, hired her as
a
servant
; and we have
reason
to believe, from
her apparent fidelity and grateful exertions, that
our
kindness
will be well repaid. I have even
extended my charity further, and undertaken to
teach her to read. She is very tractable; and I
expect to be amply rewarded for my labour, by
her improvements.
Indeed, Matilda, it is melancholy to
see
our
fellow-creatures reared up, like the brute
creation
;
neither
instructed
how to live above their
animal appetites, nor how to die as
Christians
,
when they have
finished
their
toilsome
career!
This girl is only
seventeen
. Her age,
therefore
,
as well as her docility and
submissiveness
,
encourage the
pleasing
hope of
restoring
her to
the paths of rectitude and peace. I
shall
endeavour
,
as opportunity offers, to
instil
into her
susceptible
mind, the principles of virtue and
religion
;
and, perhaps, I may lead her to the love
and practice of both, and render her a
useful
member of
society
. Her fate
impresses
, more
forcibly than ever, on my mind, the importance
of a good education, and the obligations it
confers
.
Had you or I been
subjected
to the
same
ignorance, and the
same
temptations, who can
say
that we
should
have conducted better? How
many fall for want of the directing hand of that
parental love and
friendship
, with which we are
blessed
!
Contrasting
our
situation
with her's,
how much have
we
to account for, and how
inexcusable
shall
we
be, if we violate our duty, and
forfeit our dignity, as
reasonable
creatures!
That extreme
bitterness
and acrimony, which
is
sometimes
indulged,
against
persons
who are
unhappily
seduced
from the way of virtue, may
operate as a
discouragement
to all
designs
and
endeavours
to regain it: whereas, the
soothing
voice of
forgiveness
, and the
consequent
prospect
of being
restored
to reputation and
usefulness
,
might
rouse
the attention, and call forth the
exertions
of
some
, at
least
, who, through
despair
of
retrieving their characters, abandon
themselves
to vice, and adopt a
course
, alike
disgraceful
to
their
sex
, and to human nature.
But, though I advocate the principles of
philanthropy
and
Christian
charity, as extending to
some
very
special
cases
, I am far from
supposing
this fault generally capable of the
least
extenuation
.
Whatever allowance may be made for
those
,
whose
ignorance
occasions
their ruin, no
excuse
can be offered for others,
whose
education,
and opportunities for knowing the world and
themselves
, have taught them a better
lesson
.
I need not, however, be at the pains to enforce
this truth upon you: and, as my head is
so
full
of the
subject
, that I have no
disposition
to write
upon any thing
else
, I will put an end to this
incoherent
scroll
, by annexing the name of your
sincere
and faithful friend,
MARIA WILLIAMS.
To
Miss
CAROLINE LITTLETON.
Boston
.
DEAR CAROLINE,
Happening
to be in my chamber, this
morning, the maid came running up
stairs
in
such
violent
haste
, as to put
herself
fairly out of breath.
Will you be
so
kind,
Miss
Sophia,
said
she
, as to
lend me a quarter of a dollar? I put my hand
into my pocket, and found I had no
small
change.
I have nothing
less
than a dollar,
Susan
,
said
I;
but, if it is a matter of
consequence
to you, I
will go to my mamma, and procure it for you.
She was loath to give me that trouble; but, if I
would, it would really oblige her very much
indeed
.
Her
solicitude
excited my
curiosity
. Will
you inform me what you want it for?
said
I.
O yes;
she
believed it was no harmBut there
was a woman in the wood-
house
, who told
fortunes
;
and
she
wished
to know her's, but could
not without the money. A woman who tells
fortunes!
said
I. What fortunes? the
past
, or
the future? The future, to be
sure
, Ma'am,
rejoined
she
. Ay, how does
she
know them?
said
I. Has
she
been let into the
secret
designs
of
Providence? or can
she
divine the
mysteries
of
fate? She tells fortunes by cards, Ma'am,
said
she
; and I really believe
she
tells true. Can you
imagine,
said
I, that a knowledge of your
destiny
in life, is to be gained from any
possible
arrangement
U 2
of a pack of cards? Why not, Ma'am?
Many people have been told exactly what was to
happen. You may depend on it,
Susan
,
said
I,
you are deceived. The Almighty, who
disposes
all events according to his
sovereign
pleasure
,
does not unveil futurity to mortals,
especially
to
such
mortals, who, by an idle vicious
course
of
life, counteract his laws, and
disregard
his
authority
.
I would willingly give you the money,
twice told, if you needed it; but I cannot
consent
to your being
imposed
on, by this
worthless
vagrant, who has no other
design
than to pick
your pocket.
The girl departed at
these
words; and, though
I felt an emotion of regret at
refusing
to gratify
her, yet my
reason
and
conscience
forbad my
being
accessary
to the fraud.
This
curiosity
to explore the hidden
counsels
of
the
Most
High, prevails not only among
servants
,
but even many, from whom better things might
be expected, are under its infatuating influence.
The Supreme Being has, for
wise
and
benevolent
reasons
, concealed from us the future
incidents
of our lives. A humble reliance on his
power and
goodness
, accompanied with a cheerful
submission
to the
dispensations
of his providence,
is what the Lord our God requireth of us.
I have heard my mamma relate an anecdote of
a particular friend of her's, who was
imposed
on
very
seriously
in this way.
A gentleman, whom I
shall
call Sylvander, was
very deeply in love with her; but his
person
,
and, much more, his
disposition
and manners,
were extremely
difgusting
to her.
Averse
to the
very idea of a connexion with him,
she
accordingly
refused
his
addresses
. Yet he had art
fussicient
to
interest
her friends in his behalf; who,
pitying his
situation
, endeavoured to
soften
the
heart of the obdurate fair. But in vain they
strove
to conciliate her affections.
In defiance of all
opposition
, however, he
incessantly
obtruded his
visits
, till
she
reluctantly
admitted them; and being
somewhat
coquettish
,
she
at times received him more benignly; which
flattered his hopes of ultimately
accomplishing
his
wishes
. Finding his ardent
suit
of but little
avail, and perceiving that he made but
small
progress
towards gaining her favour, he had
recourse
to art.
Surprising
her, one day, in
close
confabulation with a fortune-teller, the idea
immediately
struck
him, that he might effect, through
this mean, what all his
assiduity
and
solicitations
could never
insure
. He communicated his plan
to a female friend, who was equally the
confident
of both parties. Directed by him,
she
converfed
with Sylvia on the
subject
;
professed
her
belief in the
skill
of
these
jugglers; and appeared
desirous
of taking this
measure
to learn her fate.
Sylvia joined in her opinion and
wishes
; and
away they tripped together on the important
errand
.
Meanwhile, Sylvander had been to the
fellow who was to reveal their
destinies
; and,
bribing him to favour the
design
, left him,
instructed
what
answers
to make to their
interrogations
.
They arrived, and
proposed
their
business
. The
mediums of information, a pack of cards, were
brought forth, and
mystcriously
arranged.
Sylvia's
curiosity
was on tip-toe. She
listened
with
profound attention to his oracular
wisdom
; and
believed him really
inspired
, when he told her,
that her former lover, for whom
she
had a great
regard, was gone to a foreign country. This
she
knew to be true, and therefore gave him full
credence
,
when he added, that he would never live
to return; and when he proceeded
still
further
to
observe
, that another gentleman of great merit
now courted her; that
she
was not fond of his
addresses
, but would
soon
see
his worth and her
own error; give him her hand, and be happy.
In
short
, he
so
artfully blended the
past
and
present
, which
she
knew, with the future which
Sylvander
wished
, and had therefore dictated,
that
she
was firmly
persuaded
he dealt with
some
invisible
power, and that fate had, indeed,
predestined
her to the arms of Sylvander.
Convinced
of this,
she
attended to his overtures more
placidly, contemplated his
person
and
endowments
with
less
aversion
, and endeavoured to
reconcile
herself
to the unavoidable event.
This
she
effected; and not long after, he
obtained
her in marriage, and triumphed in the
success
of his duplicity.
In
process
of time, her other lover returned.
Disappointment
and
despair
presided
in his
breast
. He
saw
Sylvia, upbraided her with her
inconstancy
, and declared
himself
utterly ruined.
Pity and returning love operated in her mind,
and rendered her completely wretched. She
most
severely
condemned her own folly, in
liftening
to the dictates of a
misguided
curiosity
;
and acknowledged
herself
justly
punished
, for
presuming
to pry into the
secret
designs
of
Heaven.
These
strolling
pretenders to foreknowledge
are peculiarly dangerous to the weak-minded and
credulous part of the community; and how it
happens that they are ever encouraged, is to me
inconceivable. Did they actually give the
information
they
promise
, how much
reason
should
we have to avoid them! How many
sources
of
grief would be opened, by the anticipation of
future evils, of which, now, we have no
apprehension
!
and how often
should
we be deprived
of the
consolatory
hope of a
speedy
deliverance
from
present
sufferings
!
With every
sentiment
of
respect
and affection,
I am
most
sincerely
your's.
SOPHIA MANCHESTER.
To
Miss
ANNA WILLIAMS.
Boston
.
DEAR ANNA,
A MOST melancholy and
distressing
event
has
spread
a gloom over the face of the
metropolis
.
Every heart heaves the
sympathetic
sigh
,
and every eye drops the tear of regret. The
very
sudden
death of Doctor Clarke, who was
seized
with an apoplectic fit, in the
midst
of his
sermon
,
yesterday
afternoon, and expired this
morning, is a
subject
of
universal
lamentation.
Not only we, who had the
happiness
to
sit
under
his
ministry
, and to enjoy his particular
friendship
and attention, but the whole town;
and, indeed, the public at large have
sustained
a
great
loss
in his departure. Amiable in his
disposition
,
engaging in his manners, and
benevolent
in his whole deportment, he conciliated the
affections of every
class
. His talents as a
scholar
,
philosopher
, and divine, commanded the
respect
of the
most
judicious and learned; while the
elegance,
perspicuity
and delicacy of his
style
,
joined with the
undissembled
seriousness
of his
manner, rendered him uniformly acceptable to the
devout. In every condition and relation of life,
he was exemplary as a
Christian
; and as a
preacher, an air of
persuasion
invariably
accompanied
him, which
arrested
the attention of the
most
heedless
auditors.
By him, in
strains
as
sweet
As angels
use
, the
gospel
whisper
'd peace.
Grave,
simple
and
sincere
; in language plain;
And plain in manner. Decent,
solemn
,
chaste
,
And natural in
gesture
. Much
impress
'd
Himself
, as
conscious
of his awful charge,
And anxious mainly that the flock he
sed
Might feel it too. Affectionate in look,
And tender in
address
, as well becomes
A
messenger
of grace to guilty men.
He was particularly attractive to young people.
While he charmed their ear, he convinced their
understanding
, and excited them to the love and
practice of virtue.
A
striking
example of this occurred
some
years
ago, which I will take the liberty to relate. He
preached in a neighbouring church on
these
words,
She that liveth in
pleasure
is dead while
she
liveth.
[7]
[7]
I Timothy, v. 6.
In this
discourse
he painted
those
allurements
of
pleasure
which
surround
the young
and gay; more
especially
of our
sex
, in the
most
just
and lively colours. He
represented
, in
pathetic, engaging and refined language, the
snares
to which they are
exposed
, and the
most
probable
means of
escaping
them. He exhibited, with all
their attractions, the native charms of virtue, and
pourtrayed vice in its true deformity. He
described
,
in the
most
animating terms, the
respectability
,
usefulness
, and
happiness
of
those
who
undeviatingly adhere to the path of rectitude
and innocence; and, with the
most
energetic
and affectionate
tenderness
, warned the youth to
avoid the devious walks of vice and
dissipation
.
A number of young ladies, who had been his
hearers, happening to be together in the evening,
united in the
wish
to
express
their gratitude to
him; but not having a
personal
acquaintance
with him, could
devise
no better method than
writing
.
The following anonymous letter was
accordingly
penned by one of the company, and
privately
conveyed to the Doctor, at the
request
of all.
Boston
.
REVEREND SIR,
The
well known candour of your
disposition
,
and your apparent zeal for the promotion
of religion and virtue, embolden us to flatter
ourselves
, that you will pardon this method of
conveying to you our
sincere
and united thanks
for your very
seasonable
, judicious, and
useful
discourse
, delivered
last
Sunday morning, at our
meeting.
It is much to be lamented, that the depravity
of the age is
such
, as to render
sermons
of this
nature
just
and
necessary
; and it is
almost
matter
of equal regret, that we have
so
seldom
opportunities
of being benefited by them.
That we oftener hear than receive
instruction
,
is a truth which can neither be denied, nor
evaded; and can only be accounted for, by that
passionate
fondness
for
pleasure
, which prevails
to
such
a degree of
enthusiasm
, as to precipitate
its votaries into whatever
presents
itself
under
this deluding
aspect
, without
considering
whether
it be durable, or fleeting.
It is certainly a
most
humiliating reflection,
that our
sex
(which is the female)
should
ever take
more pains to gain the qualifications of agreeable
triflers than of rational friends; or be more
anxious to become
amufing
, than
useful
companions
.
But, Sir, does not
such
conduct in
ladies
too often receive the
most
flattering
encouragement
from the gentlemen? How
seldom
is
intrinsic
merit
distinguished
; and the
serious
,
prudent female
preserred
, even by
those
who
style
themselves
men of
sense
and penetration,
to the airy flaunting coquette!
The
constant
attention which is paid to
those
who make the
gayest
appearance, and the
applause
which is
lavished
upon her who has the
largest
portion of external graces and
fashionable
embellishments
, induce many who entertain the
good-natured
desire
of
pleasing
, to
bestow
more
of their time and care on the cultivation of
those
supersicial
accomplishments
, which they find
necessary
to render them acceptable to
most
circles
into which they fall, than upon the
acquisition
of
those
substantial
virtues, which they daily
see
neglected and ridiculed; though, at the
same
time, perhaps, they are convinced of the
superior
satisfaction
which the latter would afford.
W
But it is
needless
for one
sex
to criminate the
other. We allow, that, generally
speaking
, they
are equally to blame. In this
instance
, however,
as the male
assume
the prerogative of
superior
judgment and intellectual abilities, they ought
to prove the
justice
of their claim by
setting
nobler
examples, and by endeavouring to reform
whatever tends to vitiate the
taste
and corrupt
the morals of
society
.
Yet, after all, the evil cannot be effectually
remedied, but by the concurrent exertions of both:
and we are humbly of opinion, that if this
reformation
were more frequently inculcated from the
pulpit, in the delicate, engaging, and pious
manner
of the
discourse
which now excites our
gratitude
to you, and our
resolutions
to conduct
accordingly
,
it would be efficacious in bringing
about
so
desirable
an event.
We entreat your pardon, Reverend Sir, for
the freedom, prolixity, and errors of this
epistle
.
Though
personally
unknown to you, we
doubt not you will readily grant it, when we
assure
you, that we are actuated by a
sincere
regard to the
interests
of religion and morality, and by a
grateful
sense
of your exertions in the glorious
cause
.
The united
sentiments
of a number of young
ladies, who heard and admired your
sermon
,
last
Sunday morning, are
expressed
above.
Rev.
John Clarke
.
It is much to be regretted, that Dr. Clarke did
not
publish
more of his literary labours.
The
universal
approbation
bestowed
upon
those
,
which he
suffered
to
see
the light, is an unequivocal
evidence of his merit, as an author. His
Letters
to a Student in the
University
of Cambridge,
are written in a
most
pleasing
style
, and contain
instruction
and advice, of which no
person
in
pursuit
of a public education ought to be ignorant.
His
Answer
to the
question
, Why are you a
Christian
? which has already had three editions in
Boston
, and three in England, is one of the
best
compendiums of the external and internal
evidences
of our holy religion, extant. It is plain
and intelligible to the
lowest
capacity, and may
enable every one without much
study
, to give a
reason
for the hope that is in him.
From
these
specimens
we may form an opinion
of what the world has
lost
by his early exit.
I
shall
make no other apology for the length
of this letter, than the
interest
which I feel in
the
subject
; and this, I am
persuaded
, you will
deem
sufficient
.
My affectionate regards wait on your mamma
and
sister
, while I
subscribe
myself
your's
most
sincerely
,
JULIA GREENFIELD.
To
Miss
CLEORA PARTRIDGE.
Beverly
.
DEAR CLEORA,
The
shortness
of time is a very common
subject
of complaint; but I think the
misuse
of
it, a much more
just
one. Its value is certainly
under-rated by
those
who indulge
themselves
in
morning
sloth
.
Sweet, indeed, is the breath of morn; and
after
the body has been
refreshed
by the
restoring
power of
sleep
, it is peculiarly prepared to
procure
and participate the
pleasures
of the mind.
The jarring
passions
are then
composed
, and the
calm operations of
reason
succeed
of
course
; while
Gentle gales,
Fanning their odoriferous wings,
dispense
Native perfumes, and
whisper
whence they
stole
These
balmy
spoils
.
The morning is undoubtedly a
season
, of all
others
,
most
favourable to
useful
exertions.
Those
,
therefore, who
lose
three or four hours of it, in
slumbering
inaction, make a voluntary
sacrifice
of
the
best
part of their
existence
. I
rose
to-day,
not with the
sun
, but with the dawn; and after
taking a few turns in the garden, retired to the
summer
-
house
. This, you know, is a favourite
hour with me.
To me be nature's volume broad
display
'd;
And to
peruse
its all-
instructing
page,
Or, haply catching
inspiration
thence,
Some
easy
passage
, raptur'd, to
translate
,
My
sole
delight; as thro' the falling glooms
Pensive
I
stray
, or with the rifing dawn
On fancy's eagle-wing
excursive
soar
.
Having a memorandum-book and pencil in my
pocket, I
descended
from the lofty heights to
which the immortal bard, my beloved
Thompson
,
had
insensibly
raised
my imagination, to the
humble
strains
of
simple
rhyme, in order to
communicate
my
sensations
to you.
These
I
enclose
,
without attempting to tell you, either in
prose
or
verse
, how affectionately I am your's.
MATILDA FIELDING.
THE morning dawns, the
russet
grey
Slowly avoids the opening day:
Receding from the gazing eye,
The
misty
shades
of twilight fly.
The ruddy
streaks
of light appear,
To guide our
western
hemisphere
;
While tuneful choirs
responsive
join
To
praise
the gracious Pow'r Divine,
Whose
mighty hand, with
sov
'reign
sway
,
Restores
, alternate, night and day.
Hail, opening morn! thy
sober
rays
Demand the contemplative gaze;
W 2
Unnumber'd beauties
please
the
sight
,
And give the mental eye delight.
O dawn! thy
sombre
shades
I love;
With thee in
solitude
I'll rove;
While health
expansive
gives the mind
To
taste
thy
pleasures
unconfin'd.
Here, free from
fashions
artful forms,
Benevolence the
bosom
warms;
Persuasive
virtue charms the
soul
,
And
reason
's laws alone control.
Let others,
lost
in
sloth
, forego
The joys thy early hours
bestow
;
Thy zephyrs far more
sweets
dispense
,
Than
Somnus
yields to
drowsy
sense
!
Mild as thy beams of radiance
shine
,
May piety my powers refine;
Pure as thy mimic pearls, that
spread
Their liquid beauties o'er the mead;
And, like you
rising
orb of day,
May
wisdom
guide my dubious way.
To
Miss
MATILDA FIELDING.
Harmony-Grove
.
DEAR MATILDA,
I WAS,
last
week, at
Boston
; and, having
occasion
for a new hat,
stepped
into a milliner's
shop
to inquire the mode. The milliner
replied
,
that it was not yet in her power to
answer
my
question
. The
spring
ships
,
said
she
are
later
than common; but their arrival is hourly
expected
,
when we
shall
be
furnished
with
memorandum-books
which will
ascertain
and
determine
the
fashion
for the
season
. What
she
meant by memorandum-books, I could not
conceive
.
I had always
supposed
them blanks,
designed
for noting whatever occurred, without
inconvenience
.
Unwilling, however, to be thought
a
simple
country-girl, totally unacquainted with
the world, I
sought
no explanation from her;
but repaired to a particular friend for
instruction
.
From whom I learned that the chief value of
these
same
memorandum-books
consists
in their
containing imported cuts of ladies' head-
dresses
,
hats, and other habiliments, which are always
sure
to be admired and imitated, as the perfection
of
taste
and propriety!
This
discovery
mortified me exceedingly. It
justified
, beyond any thing which I had ever
suspected
to
exist
as a fact, what I once heard a
European
affert, that Americans had neither
character
nor opinion of their own.
With due deference to
those
better judges, who
despise
the
simplicity
of our
ancestors
, and labour
to introduce the corrupt manners and
customs
of
the old world into our country, I cannot but
think it extremely ridiculous for an independent
nation, which
diseards
all foreign influence,
glories
in its freedom, and
boasts
of its genius and
taste
,
servilely
to ape exotic
fashions
, even in
articles
of
dress
and fanciful ornaments.
Have not the daughters of Columbia
sufficient
powers of invention to decorate
themselve
?
Must
we depend upon the winds and waves for
the form, as well as the materials of our garb?
Why may we not follow our own inclination;
and not be deemed finical or
prudish
in our
appearance
,
merely
because
our habit is not exactly
correspondent
with the pretty pictures in the
memorandum-books,
last
imported?
It is
sincerely
to be regretted that this
subject
is viewed in
so
important a light. It occupies
too much of the time, and
engrosses
too much
of the
conversation
of our
sex
. For one, I have
serious
thoughts of declaring independence.
ANNA WILLIAMS.
To
Miss
CAROLINE LITTLETON.
[
On the Death of her Mother
.]
Harmony-Grove
.
MY DEAR CAROLINE,
TO tell you that I am
sorry
for your
loss
,
or that I
sympathize
with you in your affliction,
would be but the language you daily hear; and
often, perhaps, from the unfeeling and
indifferent
.
But, you will do me the
justice
to believe,
that I take a particular
interest
in your concerns,
and really
share
your grief. A holy Providence
has wounded you by a
stroke
, which is extremely
painful and fevere. Your
best
friend is
shrounded
in the grave. In the maternal
breast
, your
fondest
affections, and
most
unsuspecting
confidence
have hitherto concentred; and who can provide
you with an equivalent
substitute
? To the
almighty
Father and Friend of creation, it becomes
you to repair for comfort and
support
.
The dying advice and
counsel
of your dear
mamma, which, you inform me, were pathetic,
instructive
and
consolatory
, will be a guide to
your feet. Often realize the
solemn
scene
, and
remember, that, though dead,
she
yet
speaketh
.
You have great
cause
of
thankfulness
, that
she
was
spared
to direct you
so
far through the
intricate
and dangerous path of youth; to complete
your education; to teach you, by her example,
how to acquit
yourself
with
usefulness
and honor;
and, above all, to
furnish
you with that important
knowledge, to which every thing
else
should
be
made
subservient
how to die!
An era of your life has now commenced,
which is no
less
important than affecting. That
assisting
hand, which formerly led you, is now cold
and
lifeless
!
Those
lips, from which you have
been
accustomed
to receive information and
advice
,
are
sealed
in perpetual
silence
! And that
heart, which always glowed with the
warmest
solicitude
for your
happiness
, has
ceased
to palpitate!
You
must
now think and act for yourself. As
the
eldest
daughter, you will be placed at the
head of your father's family. You
must
,
therefore
,
adopt a plan of conduct, conducive to its
harmony, regularity, and
interest
.
Filial duty to your
surviving
parent, more
tenderly
inculcated by your participation of his
heavy bereavement, will lead you to
consult
his
inclination, and
sedulously
contribute all in your
power to lighten the burden of
domestic
arrangements
devolved upon him. While he laments
the death of a prudent, affectionate, and beloved
wife, give him
reason
to rejoice, that he is
blessed
with a daughter, capable of
soothing
the pains,
alleviating the cares, and heightening the
enjoyments
of his life.
Your brothers and
sisters
will look up to you
as the guide of their tender years. While their
weeping eyes and pathetic accents are directed
towards you, let
kindness
,
discretion
, and patience,
characterize your deportment, and engage their
confidence and love.
Having mentioned your duty to others, I
cannot
dismiss
the
subject
without dropping a few
hints for your direction, in regard to your
personal
behaviour.
A very important charge is committed to you,
as well in the duties which you owe to
yourself
,
as in the
superintendence
of your father's family.
The
sovereign
Disposer
of all things has, at an
early age, made you, in a
measure
, your own
guardian. Your father's
business
calls him much
abroad. With you, therefore, he is obliged to
entrust
, not only his
domestic
concerns; but, what
is
still
more dear to his heart, the care of your
own
person
and mind; of your own reputation
and
happiness
.
Circumstanced
as you are, company has the
most
powerful charms. Your's is now the
prerogative
of receiving and returning
visits
in your
own name. At home, you are
sole
mistress
of
ceremonies. This is extremely alluring to the
sprightly
fancy of youth. But time, you will
remember, is too important a
blessing
to be
sacrificed
to a
promiscuous
crowd of unimproving
companions.
Besides
, the character of a young
lady will
necessarily
be
sullied
by the imputation
of being
constantly
engaged in parties of
pleasure
,
and exhilarating
amusement
. Flattery often
avails
itself
of the unguarded moments of gaiety;
and,
insinuating
its
insidious
charms into the
heedless
and
susceptible
mind, inflates it with
pride and vanity, and produces an affectation and
air of
self
-importance, which are peculiarly
difgusting
,
because
easily
distinguished
from that
true dignity of manners, which
results
from
conscious
rectitude. Genuine merit is always
modest
and
unassuming
; diffident of
itself
, and
respectful
to others.
Your father has a right to your unlimited
confidence
.
You will, therefore, make him your
chief friend and
counsellor
. Though he may not
possess
all the winning
softness
of a mother, he
doubtless
has as ardent an affection for you, and
as
sincere
a
desire
to promote your welfare.
Hence you may
safely
repose
your
dearest
concerns
in his paternal
breast
, and receive, with the
utmost
deference, his kind
instruction
and advice.
Let his judgment have an entire
ascendency
over
your mind and actions,
especially
in your
intercourse
and
society
with the other
sex
.
Consider
him as better acquainted with their merit,
circumstances
,
and views, than you can be; and,
should
you contemplate a connexion for life, let
his opinion determine your choice.
Watch over your dear little
sisters
, with all the
tenderness
of fraternal affection; be their
protecttor
and friend;
instil
into their minds the
principles
of virtue and religion; arm them
against
the
snares
and temptations by which they will
be
surrounded
; and lead them, by your own
conduct, in the way of truth and peace.
When you have
leisure
and inclination to
write, the
effusions
of your pen will always be
acceptable to your
sincere
and faithful friend,
MARY WILLIAMS.
THE END.
