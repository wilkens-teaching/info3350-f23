THE LIFE OF A DOUBLE DUTCHMAN.
SECTION I.
Brothers have been
Betrayed by brothers, in that very kind.
No tie so near,
No band so sacred, but the cursed hunger
Of gold has broke it; and made wretched men
To fly from nature, mock religion,
And trample under feet the holiest laws.
The Old Couple

On the north eastern extremity of the island of
Manahadoes
,
or New-York, lies a small track of flatland backed
by a hilly country, and bordered by a narrow river, which
seems to have taken its rise from the rapid current of the
sound, flowing between the two shallow channels formed
by the shores of the lesser Barn islands and the mainland.

or symbol of the deliberations of its owners) affirmeth to the fact,
as he doth by multitudinous other facts, which from such
affirmation

relates that the gallant
Hendrick
Hudson, on his second expedition to the mighty
waters
that now bear his name, in the year sixteen hundred
and ten, by order of the Dutch East India Company, in
whose service he sailed, landed and marked out the plan
of a small settlement, which, in honour to a favourite
officer
of the Half Moon, (which was the name of the stout
and gallant bark in which the discoverer voyaged) who
had derived his birth in the famous town of Harlm in the
Low Countries, he called after that place; it was not long,
however, before the disadvantage of forming the colony in
this spot was experienced by the adventurers, who, though
they at that early period could scarcely be supposed to
have dreamt of the gigantic city and immense
commerce
which was to spring from the desert and desolate
strand, whereon the roving spirit of enterprize, and the
daring cupidity for wealth and possession, had induced
them to cope with the wild salvage in his wilderness,
and the piercing arrows of the northern frost; yet they
soon found great inconvenience from the lowness of the
water that formed their haven, for the larger supply ships
which in the season following their first embarkation,
arrived
from Holland, were not able to be brought to the
landing beneath the small palisade which had been
erected
to preserve the colonists from the irruptions of the
fierce Maquaas, as the Indian nation who held their hunting
grounds adjacent, were termed: it became therefore,
absolutely
necessary for the company's agent to select a new
site for building the intended capital of the stadholder's
dominions in the western world, which should possess a
harbour for receiving and preserving, during the rigours of
the winter, the vessels freighted with stores and other
necessaries for the hardy settlers. The Dutchman is ever
constitutionally slow at motion;it was, therefore, with
many sighs for the favourite spot they were leaving,
which, with its low marshy plain and beautiful prospect of
water, so much reminded them of the dykes and the
blooming fields of the Hague, that the adventurers
removed
to the south-western point of the island, which,
projecting
in a spacious bay formed by the confluence of the
Hudson river and the streight or oost vloed
[9]

Now called the East River.
between the
Long Island and the northern shore, afforded them every
convenience for a noble haven. They here laid the
foundation
of a fort, which was called Amsterdamand
erected
a few log huts: in a short period, however, these hardy
Netherlanders, being undisturbed by the native owners of
the soil, the warlike tribes of savages who dwelt near
them, conquered the stubborn difficulties that nature had
cast in their path of labour. As the new village grew,
the old one decayed; and in a little time, Harlm had
nearly resumed the appearance of its nativity, ere the
arrival
of the fearless navigator and his crew. No voice
broke the gloomy solemnity of neglect that enveloped it;
the sharp hiss of the rattlesnake, and the baying of the
brindled wolf, reigned once more, where so lately, yet for
so short a time, the echoes of civilized life had usurped
the long scream of the monarch eagle as he sailed through
the earth-shadowing clouds towards his mountain throne,
amid the lofty solitude of the towering Kaatskill, stole
on the sleep of midnight that lay upon this scarce trodden
strand; its airy reverberations unbroken by the startling
shout of the hunter, or the shot of the arquebuse: the
mullien stalk and the dock weed grew in the pathways,
while the green and slender creeper climbed up the walls
of the crumbling blockhouse, and the wild sumach shook
its scarlet berries to the wind, where the bright standard
of their high mightinesses the states-general, had first
been unfurled, and floated in the breezes of the new
continent
.
Years stole away, and glided in the mass of time: the
new city prospered: governors came from the mother
country gifted with powers to reward the deserving, and
to give laws to the new found province: commerce with
the neighbouring settlements of England and Sweden,
opened doors of wealth to the growing colony, which,
like a blooming and healthful child upon its mother's
bosom
,
glowed with gathering strength and happiness: the
dark and mocassined forester brought his richest furs,
and the fragrant spices of the western Indias found their
way to the rocky banks of the lordly Hudson: the smooth
hand of agriculture and unceasing industry, soon changed
the giant mountain to the smiling garden: the brown and
antlered deer tossed up his head, and springing from his
leafy covert, fled before the face of the European: the
harsh whoop of the Indian, was more seldom heard from
the pinnacle of the spiring crag, or the howl of the fierce
and bloody panther, from the dark pine forest: where the
herds of roaming buffalo had grazed, the jocund harvest
laughed: the white sails of the schuit, like light clouds
upon the bosom of the waters, were now seen daily
hovering
o'er the broad expanse of the river of Mountains

miserable bad repute) prospered, and their city spread; by

took their
place, and glistened beneath the joyous rays of the
golden
sun in Nieuw Amsterdam.
The evident prosperity of the new territory of the
United Provinces, however, unfortunately for that power,
opened the eyes of desire and envy to their European
neighbours, the English; large bodies of whom flying
from the iron hand of persecution, that religious
intolerance
had stretched over them in their native country,
had sought the freedom of worship in the boundless
deserts
of America; where, forgetful of the misfortunes and
the oppression they had suffered in their own land, (such
is the ungrateful nature of man) as their strength of
population increased, with unheard of cruelties, with fire
and sword, with murder and torture, they wrested the
country from the Indian, who in the hour of their
mourning
and distress, who in the bitterness of their exile, had
granted them a refuge and a home; who, when they
could have overpowered and massacred them to a man,
as easy as one might destroy a viper in its egg, held forth
the hand of peace to the destitute, and smoked the
calumet
of amity with the stranger;and the distressed were
succoured, and rested secure among the children of the
wilderness, unharmed by the red tomahawk of war
when in the country of civilization, they met not the
grasp of brotherhood, but the axe of death and the
embrace
of the loathsome prison house; they built their
altar on the wild shore, and its incense rose free as the
untrammelled elements: they planted their feet upon a
foreign strand which clung to their steps in friendship,
receiving them in its bosom like a parent doth its
weeping
offspring:and these men thus received, were the
venom darting snakes that hid amidst the verdant and
beautiful grass of the savanna, whose treacherous poison
concealed within the surrounding loveliness, is the first to
spread its death to the deceived and trusting traveller:
for, unmindful of the vast benefits bestowed in their hour
of nakedness, no sooner were they grown to strength,
than that country in which they were but guests, they
claimed as theirs by right: that spot on which they were
by sufferance, they haughtily deemed as owning by
chartered
dominion: the parchment deed of a monarch whose
empire was divided from it by a world, the deep and
turblous ocean, had given a title to the soil that his
predecessor
knew not existed in creationplacing their fellow
men merely because art had given a superiority that
virtue
wanted, upon the footing of the wild animals of the
woods:they hunted the red Indian from his hometore
up the olive stalk that he had planteddrove him from
his cedar wigwam, until at last, treachery, aided by the
deadly inventions of what is termed civilization, left him
not a rood of the land of his fathers; but like the birds,
driven by the approaching winter, he sought another
climate
and peace beyond the great lakes; so that in a few
years, throughout the vast country of New England, all
that remained of the wielders of the bow, was here and
there a green and flowery mound, within whose silent
bosom
mouldered the skeleton of some warrior, who,
happier
than his living brethren, crumbled to dust in the land
of his birth, though his
chichung

The shadow or spirit, which the Indians believe survives the
body, that it may rejoin its departed friends in an unknown country,
which they suppose is in the southwhere they are to enjoy every
kind of happiness; and what they believe will add much to their
pleasures is, that they should never become weary or satiated.

had gone southward to
the unknown paradise, where, never weary of the hunt,
the feast, and the dance, it sported in the shadowy revels
of its fellow heroes. With such lovers of encroachment,
and men so greedy of possession, it was not to be
supposed
that the unoffending Netherlanders would remain
long undisturbedno sooner did the wily puritan become
aware of his power, and see the weakness and the good
nature with which the Hollander bore his approaches, than
no barrier of existing peace, no legal right of boundary,
stopped his covetous advances; that selfish avarice that
lusts after the fruits which the toils of another hath
matured
,
was awakened, and little by little, by overreaching
cunning and dastard subtlety, was the country snatched
from its first settlers, until at last the mask being entirely
thrown off, the whole territory held by the Dutch, was
seized on by the English crown.
The inhabitants of Nova Belgia had all the peaceable
and substantial qualities, that characterized their
merchant
ancestors; the scion, though engrafted in another
soil, showed all the solid virtue of the parent stock
neither
had a climate of increased cold, nor the necessary
bustle attending the settlement of a new country, added
ought to their constitutional activity: their standing
maxim was still the samethat all matters must take
their required timefor that which is finished hastily, is
sure to be executed indifferently;No! things were not
done in our hurried flimsy wayfew men built their
houses in a week, as is proved by the stout dutch walls,
that give our modern improvers of building such trouble
to demolishhowever, a frequent breasting of the cold
northern storm, and the cutting winds, which gathered in
their rushing flight strength from the tops of the snowy
mountains, and the ice prisoned lagoons, may have given
to their native phlegm, a testiness of temper and
irascibility
in little matters, that is seldom enjoyed by their
fellow traders of the Scheldt,for in his contests with
the tempest, the New Amsterdamer had acquired a
necessary
length of breath or wind, that was aroused on the
slightest occasion, by a helping activity of tongue:and this
propensity hath descended to this ra in a most
admirable
degreefor it is now the mode, as well as then, to
make a great noise about nothing, and to take no notice
of concerns of moment; and indeed from this cause, it may
be that all public undertakings are begun by talking, and
therefore are accustomed to end in smoke: from hence
it is not to be wondered at, that after quietly submitting
to the change, the placable burghers of Nieuw
Nederland
remained, with slight variation, in passive subjection
to their new masters. It is true, there might have been
a noisy meddlesome fellow, who was out at the elbows,
and had a hungry eye for preferment, who, like the office
hunter at an election, blustered himself into a passion,
and strived to kick up a dust among peaceable people by
alarming them with a cry that the nation would be
ruinedbut as his wind was always spent, and his breath
shortened, as his own private object was attained, and it
was found that bread was not dearer, or stock

mature
deliberation, hath it been demonstrated to me, that there was

And it was not until the country had been many
years in the possession of the English at the opening
of this narration, that the seeds of disaffection took root
against the existing powerand doubtless many of those
dreadful convulsions that soon followed and shook the
province of New-York, (as it was now called) in 1689,
in favour of the Prince of Orange, who was then aiming
to ascend the throne of his father-in-law, the weak and
bigoted James the Second, of England, may be in part
attributed to the popish measures, and high hand used
by Sir Edmond Andross, who, about thirty years
before
the revolution in favour of William the Third, was
commissioned as governor of King James' (then Duke of
York) patent in America and is related by history to
have been a man perfectly devoted to the arbitrary views
of his tyrannical and misguided sovereignso much so,
as to have drawn down upon him the universal odium
and hatred of the people he governed. It was not,
however
,
until the spring of the year above named, that the
coals of discontent, which had every where been strewn
throughout the wide extent of colony, burst in a flame;
for finding the toleration of his religion, the shrines at
which his fathers had knelt, threatened, the Dutchman
roused him from his torpidity, and joined with the
English
follower of Calvin, to withstand the encroachments
of the Church of Rome, and the overbearing arrogance of
their papist rulers. However, even at this early period,
New-York was tainted with some of the corruption and
selfishness, that hath ever been its leading traitsthere
were then also, as now, men who were of that careful
principle
to know which was the strongest, and the party most
likely to conquer, before they made their choice or
espousal
no
matter whether the cause was just or holy
that hath ever been a minor considerationand as there
hath since been, men were not wanting who carried their
consciences in their pocket, and were ever ready to
change sides as it suited their own private interest; that
province, therefore, was not the first which roused and
turned the bold face of resistance to the advancing
oppressor
,
but for awhile stood apart as though weighing
its gain or loss in the opening contestwhile the free
spirit which the New Englander appears to have imbibed
from his birth, like a thing breathed for the vital air of
life, and the detestation which he seems to have ever
alike felt for any encroachment on the liberty of man,
here breathed itself forth; and like the field fire, caught
and spread in every place where it could find entrance
from the halls of the rich, to the naked and smoky
caverns
of the poorfrom the smiling circle round the
burgher's evening hearth, to the solitary heath, the
midnight
resting place of the belated hunter. Like the
majestic
tulip-tree, once the giant of the American forest,
towered the pervading flame above all lesser interest, the
deputed tyrant sunk like a stripling beneath the
vigorous
arm of manhood before it; he that had stretched
forth the hand of iron above his subject, as though men
were but created for his tyranny, he that had considered
those whom fate and the fragile wax of commission had
given a momentary sway and rule, but as the slaves of
his desires, the tools of his commandshe even in the
day of his grandeur, in the height of his power, quailed,
weak and shivering, before its advances. The
investments
of office, the privileges of station granted by the
sovereign, were but as atoms in the windthe dust of the
desert, the withered remnants of autumnal leaves before
the driving blast. The ruler found himself but as a reed,
the very breath of the people bent him to the earth
the crafty and overbearing Sir Edmund Andross, met the
due reward of his arrogance and artful machinations, in
a deserved and unpitied imprisonment, and soon found
himself fortunate, in being allowed without scath of life or
limb, to depart from the country where he so late had
been obeyed in terror and disgust, and return to the
superstitious
monarch, from whom he had derived his ill
used authority. At length after due interval, encouraged
by the boldness of this resolute and gallant conduct, the
citizen of New-York awoke to the call, which, like a
trumpet
clear and shrill, sounded in a note of thunder from
the grey shores of the Atlantic, to the lakesbut it was
as the wearied lion rousing him from his slumber at the
distant echoes of the chace; for at that time, early as it
was, the seed of disunion was rooted, which hath since
flourished to the disgrace of the present daythe rich
were too proud, as now, to mingle or follow even in a
good cause with the poorand these last were idle and
disunited; for in truth, most men are too selfish to
risk one atom of their convenience, to public safety
there are indeed but few persons, who do not admire to
be considered as the leaders in matters of importance, and
are vastly tickled as such, at reading their name in print
but they want all this without troubleand thus it hath
become the custom to thrust people in the public eye,
who make a great fuss for the newspapers; and then, go
home and set by their fires. At the period in question,
the vulgar were divided, abused and misled by the
senseless
arguments, and intrigues of designing knaves and busy
sharpers; who realized to their gaping listeners, the
ancient
fable of the dog and the shadow; for our own eyes
have proved to us, that none fatten on the advice of these
characters, except themselvesfor while they cajole
the greedy multitude with fine speeches, they, amid all
the disinterested patriotism, which is sure to be placed
uppermost in their sentiments, like froth upon the wave,
and always forms the garb of these deceivers, make out
to juggle them of every right and every gift of power,
from whence a shred may be gained.Indeed New-York
from such causes, presents a disgraceful spectacle, for
its extent, and population, and resourcesits offices of
trust and moment, are mostly held by those whose origin,
whose life, whose actions, befit them better for the
gallows
,
than the representatives of a majestic statefor if
by chance a man of worth attains station, a thousand
engines, mean and despicable as those who use them,
are set in play by the envious and malignant, to destroy
him, and in reality, such hath become the reputation
of the places, which are showered now alone on those
whom Cromwell hath designated as waiters upon
providence, the artful and corrupt office seekers of
the day, (for it is a rare and unprecedented thing to
bestow ought on honest men, who are not unblushing
dust-lickers and hypocrites) that the moral part of the
community, those who hold a pride in themselves of
conscious
integrity, have almost considered it a disgrace to
succeed as incumbentsand to take the situations of
those wretches who have concealed the rags and dirt of
their true standard in society, beneath accumulations
from the national purse; or to sit as Judges after men
who sacrifice justice, their consciencesif they ever
possessed
anyand their duty to honesty, to satisfy the
feelings
of some political partisan. After this detail, the
reader will not be surprised, that while the rich, the
powerful, and those whose province, it might have been
supposed from their situations in life, it was to step forward
as leaders in times of distress, turmoil and danger, held
aloof, prudently debating the odds and chances to
themselves
in case of success or defeat, and anxiously
watched
the aspect of affairs, that they might not be too late
to kiss the feet of the victor, and claim a reward for
services
they never performedthat there arose a champion
for the people in one Jacob Leisler; a man in the middle
order of life, though of considerable esteem, and having
a certain popularity attached to him from his descent,
from the Dutch portion of the populaceyet no being
(says history) could be more ill adapted to conduct and
guide a bold and hazardous enterprise, wherein aught of
management, mind or resolution, were requiredhis
fortune
was moderate, and he was destitute of every
qualification that could gain him adherents; for however
great his personal courage, he was proverbially ignorant,
and dependant on the guidance of othersyet with all
these imperfections, he succeeded in his most
extraordinary
attempt of overthrowing the established government
of greater part of the colonyfor fired at the same time
by ambition of power, and inflamed by revengefor
during
the administration of Andross in the province, he had
been an object of persecution, from his turbulence of spirit
to the governmenthe formed the perilous design of
seizing
the city for the aspiring William, who was now
contending
for the throne of his father-in-law. To
accomplish
this, Leisler, urged to haste by the success of the
eastern country, and aided by one Milbourne, an
Englishman
4*
related to him by marriage, brought over and armed
in his league, a small body of citizens, who had been
enrolled under his command, for the purpose of patroling
at night through the different out wards and skirts of the
town. At the head of these, by a sudden and unexpected
attack, he surprised the royal garrison who protected the
fortthe troops were easily overcome, making but a
slight defence, and without difficulty submitted to the
views of the insurgents, who, by this blow, found
themselves
undisputed masters of the counties of New-York
and East Chester. Accordingly, they lowered the
standard
of the Stuarts, and administered the oath of
allegiance
to their Protestant successor:and at the same
time, taking advantage of the ambiguous wording of a
despatch that arrived from England, Leisler assumed to
himself the title of Lieutenant Governor, and instituted a
council, the regular heads of authority having sought
safety
in flight; in the meanwhile he sent home an agent to
London, who might early on the succession of the
Stadtholder
,
claim the expected rewards and favours due to
the signal devotion that he had shown to his cause. But
Leisler's new dignity sat uneasy on himit has been
often seen that a rise to unbounded power, from
comparative
insignificance and dependence, is sure to bring
on a man's destructionit is not alone that he may act
indiscreetly, and bear with unbecoming pride his new
gotten consequenceyet he has more to fear from those
whom he trustsfrom those whom he heaps his friendship
on, his partisans, than the open hostility of his foes; the
flower that grows to perfection in a day, veins not the
earth with its rootsso on the very foundation on which
he hath risen, he will totter.The investiture of supreme
authority over the province, and the prospect of the
new king's approbation of his proceedings, could not but
excite the jealousy of those who had not joined in the
revolution, and hence, together with the impossibility to
satisfy the insatiable demands of needy adherents, arose
the aversion which was shown to the man and his
measures
by many individuals; however, finding it in vain at
first to stem the current of Leisler's influence, Nicholas
Bayard and Van Kortlandt, the late mayor of the city, who
were the leaders of the opposition, retired hastily to
Beverwyck
,
which is now called Albany, and urged the
rulers of that city to refuse communication with the
revolutionists, and with such industrious hatred and
animosity
,
fomented the misunderstanding, that the affairs
of the public became greatly embarrassed. The safety
of the country itself, was also extremely endangered by
the ill will and vexatious conduct of the rival parties,
who, occupied with their own jarring, respectively sought
to injure each other, until they came to open rupture of
armsof course, to this internal enemy of civil war, was
sacrificed the defences necessary by the convulsions of
the times, against a formidable and foreign adversary;
for while the one was inebriated by new and
unaccustomed
greatness, and the other could not brook, from their
former standing, submission to a man mean in his
abilities
,
and inferior in degree, the drum was sounding,
and the sword and spear were glittering on the
frontiers
.
France had taken the part of the dethroned and
exiled sovereign, and hostilities had commenced against
England:an officer of courage and talent, (the Count
De Frontenac,) well acquainted with the situation of
the disturbed and distracted province, held the command
of the Canadas; who, with an unceasing industry,
seeking
to add to the distress of the English, early in the
contest; contrived to stir up the savages against them;
for angered by numerous wrongs, they were ever ready
to wreak deserved vengeance on the white oppressors
of their fathers; all was in alarmthe tomahawk and
scalping knife found numerous victims, and the lily of
the Bourbons was crimsoned in blood. At the same
period, the broad seas were swarmed with rovers of the
most desperate character, whose whole thirst seemed
rapine and cruelty; and whose boldness and temerity
was much augmented, by the apparent insufficiency of
the authorities to suppress them:scarce a sail could
plough the waters, without her decks becoming the stage
of slaughter and of robberythe trade of the Indian
islands and the Spanish main, was nearly destroyed; and
such was the audacity of this maritime banditti, that
neither disparity of force daunted, nor laws human or
divine, restrained them from the most wicked and savage
atrocities. The numerous inlets and coves of shallow
water, where they could neither be pursued or attacked
to advantage, that line the Long Island and the entrances
of the New-York harbour, afforded these desperadoes
convenient concealment and lurking places for depositing
their plunder, or hiding their swift craft, when chaced by
a superior force, or while watching the departure of some
outward bound trader, who, from its rich cargo, was
worthy of making prize. The city itself, gave by its
countenance
to the buccaneers, an excellent market for the
disposal of the booty accumulated by their bloody
expeditions
it
is of indifference to most persons, so as they
gain by the bargain, how, or by what deed, he of whom
they purchased, became an owner; the honest
winkelier
cared not, so as he could dispose of them at three
times the rate of cost, to some vain and greedy damethat
the Spanish silk, the tissue, or the brocade, that adorned
his shelves, were not yet dry of the gore of their last
wearers,the klopliediew, as he gloated over treasures
of ingots and golden moidores that now swelled his
coffers
,
and as his daughter simpered as she hung to the
yellow beads that enchained her neck, the glittering
cross of silver that had adorned the soft bosom of some
Peruvian beauty, gave not a thought of the raging ball
that had been ruthlessly buried in the hearts of the

So far indeed did the evil extend, and such was the
weakness of the laws, which have not as yet been

as at present, the murderer, the robber and
the rogue, walked the streets without fear of

partyfor justice is not made for these; and many of
the principal inhabitants, were known to be in open
connexion
with this illicit trade. Every retailer of the laws,
was, as now, fearful of offending some powerful character,
or a sputtering and noisy partisan; and therefore, though
edict after edict was promulgated, the penalties were
scarcely enforcedfor they were but as Corporation

It appeareth most veritably unto my investigation, that this and
the like references in the narration, (albeit, there being as must be
perceived, many strange lucubrations therein, that applieth to
modern
times, as it would seem from a superficial acceptation thereof)
nathless their wording, designate in their true meaning some past
period, peradventure the era whereat the historie was indited;
howbeit, of the precise time thereof I am greatly in dubitation,
seeing that in the text there are divers digressions and
multifarious
insinuations that approximate unto matters and men, whereof
it strikes my imagination there hath been an existence in mine
own memorial of events. Nathless adverse to such conclusion
(and therefrom I am somewhat inclined to hesitate ere an ultimate
decision,) many circumstances detailed have the strongest
evidence
of an ancient origin, and must have happened perforce in the
very observance of the relater; yet assuredly from the style of the
text itself, where left by my erudite and learned friend (the editor)
in its pristine orthography, stubborn arguments might be drawn
as to the first supposition; and even from the words under
consideration
in this annotation, might be inferred an insuperable
convincement
thereof:for peradventure, understanding it that the
laws were dead letters at the time of the inditing of the narrative,
there would be an excellent agreement and association in the
particulars
thereof, with the height of civilization whereat our era hath
arrived; for the modern system of philanthropy (to which I am a
convert, detesting all barbarous customs wherein the infliction of
corporeal laceration or restriction is included,) abrogates and
abolishes
the exercise of the statutes, albeit when the application
thereof
tendeth to harm society. Whereby I mean to admit that
there existeth the letter of the law, but it is truly an inanimate and
dead letter, as the text expresseth it, for the spirit thereof is
construed
,
not the word. And peradventure this is right in penal laws,
for in the enactment thereof, the legislator intendeth of a surety
that the spirit should be taken, and not the words wherein he
expresseth
himself. Albeit the intention of penal laws goeth in these
times no further than to clear the country of useless population
poor pennyless vermin, who from want commit paltry depredations,
and are utterly inapplicable to people of consequence and wealth
who have by accident come within the jurisdiction thereof. And
to show this position to be sound, I will refer unto a late enactment

of the wise and accurate statesmen under whose rule we abide,
which condemns in case of the commission of certain trespasses
which the law reciteth, the directors of a certain hamlet, (therein
called the trustees of the village,) to be impounded in the
common pound; and before they can be loosed from such
confinement
,
they are doomed to pay the keeper and all costs. Now,
as there cometh to my knowledge no enforcement of the letter of this
law, I take it to be truly a dead letter, and only construed
according
to the spirit thereof; whereby stray cattle are impounded in the
place of the trustees. T. P.

echevin

assured the affair was very differently looked uponthe

it was a matter of too little consequence to trouble the
court withal, or it was a dangerous precedent to meddle
with persons of respectability, or as it was only the
fourth complaint, that he would speak with Mynheer, that
he might be warned for the future; or that he was too
busy in waiting the result of the election,

The colonial elections of New-York, particularly for members
of the Provincial Assemblies were carried on with uncommon
virulence
between the opposing factions of the day. Bands of partizans
with placards stuck in their hats, and armed with clubs, would
parade
the streets, and at intervals would shout and chant in Dutch and
English, the names of the candidates whose cause they espoused, as
Kruger, Van Dam, Phillipse,
Beekman, Morris, und Jacob Delancy.
and could not
spare time from public matters to attend to the business
at present, but would hereafter examine into the affair
or that the law did not exactly provide for the offence;
and remedy against such things, in future would be had
by application to the next assemblyor in final, that it
could not be expected, that his time was to be taken up
in listening to every body's malice; that as the person
who sought redress for the people was unknown, the
whole subject was unworthy of notice, and no
indictment
could be drawn without a flaw.But to resume my
subject:as it hath often appeared that a man can see
the mote in the eye of his neighbour, much quicker than
he can perceive the fault in his own, so it was in this
case,for the Spanish, backed by other friendly powers,
made heavy charges to the court at Whitehall, against
these frequent aggressions on their property, which were so
openly committed by the subjects of a nation then at peace
with them, and who pretended to maintain an amicable
intercourse and relation, while they were encouraging
despoilation; all this appeared to the citizens of
New-York
,
as very unreasonable, and a very impertinent
interference
in the government of a country, the riches of
whose inhabitants they were daily seizing on with the
strong hand; whose officers they were accustomed to
insult
,
in the very mouths of their cannon, with impunity;
and who, in short, they considered as their prey, from
their riches and indolence: and who, owing to
circumstances
,
was then the weakest power; and therefore,
without grumbling, it was thought they ought, as marks
of regard and deference for the strongest, allow
themselves
to be drubbed, robbed and bearded. As is
customary
on occasions of excitement, a self-formed
committee
of three, having all things cut and dried for fear
of a mistake in the performance, called a public meeting,
in the name of all the citizens, through the medium of
the Post-boy,

when one takes in mind the talents of the editor, was
not out of the way; seeing that once a week he
enlightened
his readers with an account of the secret plans and
the private thoughts of the cabinet of the great Cham

and who it was believed, was then about going to war;
and as the writer was also accustomed to cut up and
slap at a terrific rate, the policy of the king of the
Hottentots, who was very unpopular through these sharp
attacks, and no doubt must have felt extremely sore at
perusing them. However, the above mentioned

interested

eloquent specimen of modern oratory, as was announced
by the Post-boy next morning; the editor of which paper,
by the by, having received a corrected copy of the speech
a week before it was delivered, for publication: the
diminutive
speaker, after exhausting his lungs, storming
against the audacity of the lazy and haughty donsand
to the very top of his voice, calling on each honest man
present and absent, to oppose every attempt of
governmental
proceeding; and concluding with a flowery and
glowing
description of his own patriotism, and that he was no
friend of tyrants, even before he was born, sat down
exhausted
and panting for breath, amid repeated shouts of
applause
from his audience, very few of whom had heard a
word that he had said;his silence was followed by a long
string of resolutions, flaming with determinations which
in a week were forgot; but which were all appropriate,
being ready made to suit the occasion, and brought in
the pocket of a stormy pot-bellied burgher, who read
them off in a snuffling tone, puffing and labouring at
every
word, as if his entrails were coming through his
throatand then all was adjourned by motion in order

greatest
regularity and decorum, not excepting a dozen

divide gains, and determine what would be befitting

distinguished

as used by Hume, is here adopted.
Richard Kid, who had been recommended by an
ancestor
of the Livingston family, as a man who was well
acquainted with the customs, manuvres and rendezvous
of the pirates. But Kid, in setting out on this cruise,
was moved by the same motives which guide most of
our own brawling bullies, and swearing politicians
self-interest
and
therefore soon betrayed his trust; for, like
a certain hypocritical time server, who by his shifting,
servile and corrupt conduct in office, has become as
contemptible
as the crawling vermin, whom in his
character
he resembles, and whose custom it hath been
as it were by instinct, to preserve a station which he has

day of an election, to that which his shrewd judgment
foreboded would be the conquerorso that, though a
dozen principles have had their sway, it hath mattered

to himhe was always among the victors. Kid
eagerly
seized upon the opportunity thus fortuitously thrown in
his way, and sought to use the armament and advantage
he possessed, in the furtherance of his own purpose,
for having burnt the frigate he commanded, he leagued
with the buccaneers; and at the period of the narration,
the commencement of which follows, his savage actions
and desperate exploits, had filled the country with
horror
and amazement. To such an alarming extent had
grown the terror of his name, that the parts of the
province
where it was supposed and reported that his
lawless
crew used to frequent or land, either for the sake of
concealing the booty acquired by their robberies, or to
carouse after some murderous and successful expedition,
were avoided with fear and superstition, by all except
his associates, who, however, were numerous; and
although
even by them he was hated for his barbarity,
yet he seldom found want of stores and assistance, when
necessitated to put in port: indeed the fear that he
inspired
,
not only pervaded the breasts of those whose
callings were to plough the deep and weltering seas, but
many far distant, at least in appearance, from his
revenge
,
dared scarcely breathe a threat: encouraged, and
hourly emboldened in his unbridled course, the hand of
justice was too weak to wield the avenging sword;
formidable
and unrestrained, his audacious emissaries were spread
in every quarter of the coast, and countless were the
deeds acted, that would harrow up the soul, and chill the
blood's free flowing in the hearer's veins, at the relation:
and often when the storm from the north, howled bleak and
dismal, and swept from the trackless ocean with mournful
voice, and like a funeral dirge sung round the snug cabin
of the fisherman, its inmates would fearfully whisper,
that the spirits of the murdered had risen from their
watery graves, where they had been darkly tombed, to
shriek their curses on the pirate; such is ever the
idea of man; for there is a secret and natural abhorrence
against great crimes, instilled upon our minds from birth,
that however prosperous guilt may be for awhile, yet as
the terrible and just sentence denounces `blood will have
blood,' so a late though a sure punishment, must attend
upon the guilty, and their most hidden actions:thus
many believe, but the ways of providence are
inscrutable
,
or how can we account for the evident long during
of the rogues of the day? yes, we have seen to all
appearance
,
men raising their fortunes on the tears of
the poor, unpunished; every stride they take to wealth,
trampling on the hearts of the unfortunateand like the
reckless warrior, in the crowded flight of the
vanquished
,
spurning the prostrate body of his falling comrade,
they base the fabric of their prosperity, upon the
hopeless
ruin and blasted happiness of others; and have we not
beheld the iron-hearted landlord go down to the grave,
leaving behind unto his offspring a mint of riches,
gathered
by grinding and extortion?he hath enjoyed a long
life, and ease and luxuryand round his plumed hearse,
are marshalled troops of weeping friendsand to his
burial place, the mournful pomp of sorrow and respect,
accompanies himwhile, mark the reverse, the generous
noble hearted creature, whose whole soul was charity
and friendship for his species, spends his life, even as a
lingering death; want, poverty and famine, his
companions
;
and ends it either in the common alms-house,
the lazaret or the prison, happy if there be a roof above
him, that he die not by the way-side untended and
unpitied
;
and his uncoffined limbs be not cast into some
loathsome pit dug for carrion:the one like several
examples
now in view, is the great, the good, the
worshipped
,
the every thing, with the world; possessing its
confidence
and its honours;and the other is always a poor
mad besotted foolish fellow, whose witless brains and
extravagant
courses in relieving the distressed, and allowing
every body to cheat him that pleased, never gave him
a chance to gather up a single dollar in his whole life;
and who has come to that which it was expected, since
he allowed himself to be so sadly shaved by the bro
kers, and endorsed for a friend who made it his pride,
after getting free by the act, to insult the poverty and
misfortune
that he had caused.As is the case just cited,
with the prosperous, whose slightest notice is more
acceptable
than the cordial smile of the thriftless; so,
though horror and disgust followed the deeds wherein he
gained them, yet the spoils of Kid introduced themselves
into the favour, and the purchase of the good burghers of
the city; and it is even asserted by tradition, but how
veritably one knows not, that at the grand festival of St.
Nicholas, which might perhaps assimilate to a
twenty-fifth
of November dinner of our own modern Corporation,
that not only the Chief Scout, but the lordly and
substantial
burgomasters, and the well fed Schepens of the
honest
city of Nieuw Amsterdam, or New-York, all
appeared
arrayed in certain calico morning gowns, which
were adorned in lieu of bloemates, with orange trees and
singing birds: the which material, had formed part of
the cargo of a Spanish galleon which Kid had lately
captured
,
and openly sent into the bay,

On the 17th August, 1691, Kid brought a prize in the port of
New-York; and the governor and council resolved, that paying

consigned, as
usual
in these cases to some respectable trading firm;
much in a like manner as our late uncommissioned
privateer
captures of the ships of a friendly nation; and
for which an agent of the original owners had instituted
a suit of recovery before the above mentioned Scout, who
acted as Judge, together with his other municipal capacities;
and as might be expected, the said suit shortly after the
aforesaid festival of St. Nicholas, was decided
peremptorily
against the Spanish merchants: from this, discerning
reader, it is evident that the custom is of singular ancient
derivation, that the mayor, aldermen and commonalty
of a certain large city, have, time out of mind, been in
the habit of `
acceptation
,' or receiving presents; which
may have a partial reference to the present fashion, of
taking a dozen bottles of excellent Madeira from each of
the wine venders in the city, before a public dinner;
none of which are returned, though the apparent
purpose
was only to taste them; when it is certain to have
the mind made up determinately about the purchase,
which must perforce be from a nabob of the same side
at the last election, before the arrival of a single flask, or
the drawing of a cork; tradition hath, it is understood,
for the sake of elucidation, farther related, that ever since
the afore cited banquet of St. Nicholas, corporations have
fallen greatly in the knack of winking at all rascals, even
though they break their own last enactions; provided they
can give presents, which are in these days, read offices,
or can gratify in any way the least selfish wish of a
burgomaster

It is said that the country on the borders of the little
river, or rather creek, the description of which begins
this work, was a favourite haunt of the sea robber, that
there he landed after his successful piracies, and that
when time or the pursuit of fresh plunder would not
permit
his lavishing his ill gotten treasures in the accustomed
debaucheries on the beach of this stream, and its wild
and desolate neighbourhood, with many superstitious
ceremonies
,
he was wont to bury them:strange are the
fearful
tales men tell, that to the keeping of infernal spirits
were given these mines of hidden riches, and even within
a few years past it was whispered abroad that the
unearthly
guardians, which he had charged with these
concealments
,
by the cruel butchery of a prisoner,
wandered
still true to their unhallowed task about the spot
where his gold lies yet unearthed. In these times, as it
becomes apparent, people have to fear nothing more
wicked than their own evil minds, the place hath been
less regarded, as the other portions of the island are more
closely settled; but in the days of the pirate Kid, the sole
representative of the famous town of Harlaem in the new
world, consisted of one broad long roofed cottage, which
indeed, in the consequence of its owner, might have
vied with its rival `in den bosch,'for suiting to its lofty
pretensions, though the building was of one story, and
the eaves almost kissed the ground, yet the gable ends
5*
soared steeply up like a pyramid, and were both
ornamented
by points or stairs, in the true style of the
Keysar
Graft, the Harring Vliet, and the Bompies; from the
centre of the mansion arose a sort of structure that
appeared
like a pigeon house, containing one huge long door,
used for the reception of goods, and although at the top
of the edifice, was the place of transacting business, when
the occupant was so inclinedabove all, mounted on a
sea of lead, sailed a small tin Dutch built boat or schuit,
which served the double purpose of a weather cock and
a ferry sign,at least so intended, but the architect who
had taken the model of the little vessel from the best in
the town of Termunderzyl, at which place he had driven
the careful craft of a brick maker, found after its
completion
that what would do in the winds of Holland was not
at all fitted for those of America, for a spanking vexatious
broad bottomed figure of one of the Dutch graces, which
filled up the poop by way of ornament, with all the
obstinacy
of the sex, who seem to flourish best when most
contradictory, always swung around whenever the wind
carried the ship in one direction to that point of the
compass
which was completely opposite; the sapient clay
moulder, to whom the mystery did not explain itself, after
having smoked several pipes in profound deliberation on
the failure of his plan of telling the wind, felt, however,
nowise put out, being possessed of true Dutch mettle
and considering himself another Quintin Matsys;

and
therefore with immense sagacity, he determined, that as
all the trouble had been taken to make it serve, it was of
no use beginning the business over anew, for the
spectator
,
by a very slight reversion, if ingenious enough, could
at most periods guess aright, the more easy if a

This saving principle of leaving things remain
in the situation they were first designed, whether right
or not, seems to be the leading maxim of modern
economists
,
if one might draw the conclusion from a grave body
corporate, who, whenever they calculate erroneously,
which, by the bye, unless one of their own members is
interested, is commonly in their own favour, take certain
pains that it shall not be easily remedied: for instance,
it is to be remarked, they allotted to themselves an
uncommon space of time to repay a certain wrongful
assessment
,
but when they, in their wisdom, assess the
property of others who individually cannot protract, they
do not wait to petition, but will have their demand at once,
nolens volens
. However, the dwelling whose top was
thus tastefully adorned, was, to all appearance, a
comfortable
domicile, which, as it snugly nestled between two
rising hillocks like an egg in the nest, seemed protected
from every dangerindeed it bore no resemblance to any
tall, gaunt, disproportioned mansion, that now casts its
clumsy shadows across the narrow lanes of the city,
showing
the nature of the owner, who selfishly means to take
the jolly face of the sun from the passers by, or to
astonish
the beholder with his magnificence and aspiring
imagination
in erecting a wind tower, which generally repays
him for his trouble by an assignment to some relation
or friend in trust, while he pays the honest carpenter for
his labour and plan, by taking the benefit of the two-third
sweeping clause, which is receiving a full and fashionable
receipt; don't look wise reader, you are not here

Be all this as it may, the home of Sporus Vanderspeigl,
for such was the wordly designation of the occupant of
the ferry house, had been the work of years; for it was
spread out something like a crab, or its owner's hand,
which it hath been truly stated exceeded in the breadth,
the length from the wrist to the end of the fingers; but
as this tradition comes direct from the wife's side of his
family, implicit confidence should not be given to it:
for as Sporus was a little man, he was like a small bottle
brimful of spirit tightly corked, and apt at times to make
a mighty explosion, or in other words get into a great
passion, particularly when his kitchen chimney smoked,
which like the contract built chimneys of the present day,
was very apt to cut up such capers whenever there was
any breeze abroad, and it is said, by whom it is not
accurately
known, that before he removed from the city of
Nieuw Amsterdam, his vrouw having on a windy Monday
purchased at the Zmidts Vly,
[21]
[21]
Since called Flymarket.
at the extravagant rate
of four stuyvers, a fat Kalkoensche hen from a broad
mouthed Long Island negro, he was so enraged at her
prodigality
,
that as every honest burgher was used when the
goed vrouw went astray, he gently corrected the
spendthrift
quean with the said Kalkoensche hen; but which
fact her relations, after the common fashion of all such
meddling persons, flatly denyvilely reporting that Sporus
had basely beat the good woman with his hand; for
which atrocious slander the honest and learned Dutch
Schepen or Assistant Alderman, who in those days held
about the same dignity as those of our own times, being
equally as thick headed and consequentialthough
possessing
in addition a kind of authority resembling our
police
magistracy
ordered
, that both the party slandered,
and Jan Van Schroper and Derrick Tunesse Snedigher,
relations to the aforesaid vrouw Vanderspeigl, the
slanderers
,
should pay fifty schellings
to the poor;
and further,
that Garret Van Hoorn, the `konstabel,' should
discharge
the costs:now though no reasonable creature
will deny the uprightness and profundity evinced by this
decisionand that all parties should be punished for the
disturbance of the peace, and wilful annoyance of the calm
and quiet of the tranquil province of Nieuw Nederlandt
yet who could suppose that the villanous breath of slander
would have dared to whisper that the worthy and
immaculate
Schepen deposited the mulct in an inner drawer
of his lessenaar; and being plagued with a shortness of
memory, peculiarly in matters of this kind, he neglected to
render in his general monthly return to the vroedschap,
the afore-mentioned sum of fifty schellings;nevertheless,
though true, this might have been an accident, for it is now
no uncommon thing for a public officer to become a
defaulter
to a round amount, and then, on account of the hardness
of his case, apply to government to let him clear of debt,
giving as a reason that he does not know what has
become
of the money. However, from the transaction just
detailed, the patient magistrate acquired the surname of
den Springer, or the
Hop
per, owing to the badness of
his eyesight, which forced him to jump over the
afore-mentioned
item of fifty schellings.
In the present instance Sporus seemed determined not
to be outdone by any Dutch farmer in the convenience
and costliness of his tenement, and he was therefore, while
debating the design, extremely particular, slow, and
cautious
,
as all wise Dutchmen are invariably in affairs of
moment
and emergency; which is no doubt the reason why
their ideas are so weighty and profound; for like city
feastsgreat thoughts are not to be digested in a minute,
and, as the adage teaches, Rome was not built in a day;
so it might be repeated of the residence of this Hollander
for it cost him four years of smoking, planning, and
reflection
to begin the structure, two more to lay the
foundation
,
and twice that time ere the first apartment, which
was the pronk room, was finished to his liking. Do not
consider, expeditious reader, that all this period was
spent in projecting and finishing off any thing like the
tawdry gingerbread finery of one of the four story barns,
which are the unrivalled specimens of the improved
architecture
of these daysno, Sporus was a man of prudence,
and his mind and desires were only bent on obtaining a
modest Dutchman's comfort; and indeed though all the
materials were of the best, the only extravagance known
in the building, and that was the boast and pride of
Mynheer's
heart, was the monstrous width of the chimney
placewhose great mantel piece jutted boldly from the
wall like the blackened jaw of some huge and cavernous
den, while each side was variegated with neat glazed
china tiles, which at the enormous cost of a stuyver a
piece, had been imported from the manufactory at
Rotterdam
;
and whereon was delineated in a masterly
manner
a whole Bible historythe life of the patriarch
Joseph
and the dreams of Pharaoh, which however were
interpreted
after the artist's own fashion, for not having an
ox as a model at hand, he had, in the frenzy of the
moment
,
by an excusable graphic license, made both lean
and fat kine resemble the acute quadruped called the
jackass, as near as any other animal in creation, although
at the same time he could not have been accused of
violating
the commandment of Scripture, as it would have
been difficult to have ascertained an exact similitude of
the creatures figured, in earth, air, or in any other
element. As soon as the exterior of the building was
completed, Sprous moved bag and baggage into the
mansion, and that all his valuables might be secured from
spoilers, which commonly appeared in those times in the
shapes of thieving Indians or pilfering and wandering
pedlars from the New England provinceswho under
the name of trading, but in reality for the sake of
sharping
,
inundated the country of the inactive and ease loving
Meinheers, elbowing them out of their quiet and cheating
them out of their very eyes, much in the same manner

(in the raising of which animals he hugely delighted,) his
`kist' of guilders, together with an old spavined, wind
dried blind mare, and a lean, lank, bare ribbed skeleton of
a snarling mastiff; for with all the slackness of
movement
that Vanderspeigl was famous for, he had by some
means or other amassed considerable wealth; and as he
was too lazy to seek fortune, it really seemed as if the
fickle divinity determining that he should not be
indifferent
about her embraces, had therefore with open arms
ran to him, for she appears to have her humours like all
females, and the best way oftentimes to obtain her
favours
is to treat her with indifference, and not to trouble
one's head about her; now in this the prudence and
foresight of Sporus cannot be too much commemorated;
and indeed he was not only worth money, but he knew
how to keep it; he was not one of those eager, avaricious
hazarders, who anxious to make themselves rich or to
add to that which was already an independence, would
jeopardise all upon one single chanceleaving their
happiness
or destruction to the changing of a breeze:for
once, being offered by old Conraedt Goelet, a tight,
crabbed dealing Nieuw Amsterdamerbut who was
something given to dress, a whole tract of woodland
situated in the neighbourhood of Spring Garden and the
Holy Ground,
[23]
[23]
This extended from about where Dey-street now is, until
beyond
the College and Park-place; and being the suburbs, was a spot
almost exclusively devoted to dancing and gaming houses, and
other rendezvous of the lowest description, and from its character
it had obtained in derision the name of the Holy Ground. Such
was the ill fame of this portion of the city, that the site of St. Paul's
Church was given as a donation in a pious fit of the owner of the
soil, whose conscience possibly pricked him with the evil deeds
committed on his property, for the purpose of erecting a place of
public worship. And it is recorded that the text at its consecration,
preached from by the rector, was from Exod. chap. iii. verse 5,
And he said, Draw not nigh hither, put off thy shoes from off thy
feet, for the place whereon thou standest is
holy ground
.
in exchange for a beaver hat, whose
fashion was the latest worn in the HagueVanderspeigl,
who well knew he could sell an article of such demand
for at least ten stuyvers, could not help wondering at such
a foolish idea as that Goelet could suppose he was to be
taken in that wayso after hearing patiently all the fine
arguments that were used to induce him to close the
bargain, he shook his head in a knowing manner, and
placing his finger by the side of his nose he only
answered
dat Meinheer Goelet dont drick beobles mit hish
dalking out vrom dere geldt. As may be expected from
such amazing shrewdness and knowledge of the world,
Sporus might have been called in the expressive idiom of
the moderns a warm man; and doubtless, had banks been
chartered at so early a period, judging by the great and
efficient personages of this era concerned in the
controlling
of such institutions, Meinheer Sporus Vanderspeigl
would have been a capital character for the president of
one; for as he was a cunning man with all his phlegm, he
would have taken precious care to feather his own nest,
though the public suffered thereby;and in truth who
are the public, every body?then surely it is a safe
maxim, that being such it cannot feel a loss or injury like
an individual; it does not therefore surprise that so many
shave
the every body
for a private advantage; and
besides
all must perceive the many cannot be harmed by
that which is taken to enrich a single person.
Still with all that he was blessed, Vanderspeigl had to
contend with foul breaths and evil tongues. Never have
men congregated together, no matter in how small a
portion
,
but what they have envied each other, and sought to
destroy that which they themselves were unworthy of and
unable to attain; what I have not, none other shall have, is
the maxim under which most act; and whence hath arisen
so much sorrow, misery and destruction: scandal, with its
cold and blighting wing, freighted with self swoln
intelligence
,
was busy with his fame; and there were
whispered
hard stories about the guilders that this Dutch owner
of Harlaem Ferry had collected in the safe depository of
his homeand much was said of a great chest which had
been seen in the Hollander's house, and which as
reported
he watched with unceasing caution; now there was
nobody who could tell who had a glimpse of this mystery,
or give an account in the least connectedyet all agreed
that the chest, whatever was in it or whatever it wasif
indeed after all it was a chesthad not been fairly come
by; and then the speakers would shrug their shoulders and
wofully turn up their eyes in an awful and meaning
manner
.
Thus from the busy brains and quicker mouths of
jealous knaves or fools is the peace of even the innocent
destroyed; for every communication that harmeth
another
,
is given to all except the object of the rumour
and like the flames from lightning borne that in the dried
forest rages swifter than wind, it hurries on, gathering in
its blasting flight new vigourthus are our lives a
torment
thus
by insidious lies are we pierced to the
marrow
and
like one stabbed by some coward bravo in the
back, we see not the arm that darts the blow, and die
unable to avengefor the victim is the last to know the
extent of the calumny:is not this persecution worse
than the sword or the axe? doth it not blast the brain
and sear the heart with hopeless misery?truly it
turneth
our souls to gall and bitterness, and man becomes
companionless, a phantom among his fellows, and moves
through life solitary, suspicious, and hating, like a lonely
Vol. I. 6
and stormy cloud that blots the visage of a summer
heaven. Indeed, many were the mischief-fraught tales
told in all the pride of conscious importance by those
notable
tea-table housewife gossips, whose time is passed in
the busy and saving duty of looking after every body's
affairs
except their own, that were not much to the credit
of the honest scouw steerer:there were dark hints of
piratesof murdered travellerssuch as a certain person
on a certain gloomy night stopping at the ferry house and
asking for a night's lodgings, and the certain person being
never seen to depart.
Whether it be that sudden accumulation of wealth
alone creates envy and desire, or it is engrafted in the
very nature of humanity to pluck a hole in the garment
of a fellow creature who is not even a stumbling stone in
our path of prosperity, cannot be solved; but while
Sporus
(and such had been the case) could not enumerate
more than one pair of `broeks' in his wardrobe, and his
home was nothing but a miserable hovel of rude unplaned
logs, scantily thatched with bark, whose only aperture
besides the low entrance was a small hole in the roof,
which admitted faintly the light of the heavens, and
afforded
a void for the smokethen there was none who
thought him worthy scarce of a passing word, for he was
looked upon as one of those wretched outcasts who in
the freaks of unpropitious fate had been cast upon this
world of wo as a very model of miserybut now the
picture
was reversed, things were entirely changed, and
though the good dames who have been mentioned were
never weary behind his back as has been stated, at
denouncing
him a gruff, cross creature, who knew more of
some things than he should do for his conscience sake,
yet in his presence, no man in the whole island of
Manathan
was more belarded and beflowered with compliments
the Dutch language itself was wasted and exhausted
in culling sentences fruitful in respect, and instead of
plain Sporus as it had been, Mynheer Sporus
Vanderspeigl
,
and hoe vaart u Mynheer, were now the
current
pass words. Had it been in the present day that
this was enacted, Sporus would certainly have stood an
excellent chance for being elected a congressman, and
probably a governor, for from a natural taciturnity he was
much averse to speaking, which would have looked very
wise and sapient, and as long as it did not interfere with
his own interest, he doubtless would have `drout broper'
to vote always as his constituents directed, particularly
when on the strongest side, and by this means, placing
honour and virtue out of the question, he would have
been long able to keep his place, which is now the only
aim of a politicianand though one would suppose it no
easy matter to humour the whims of the crowd, yet the
practice and improvement of the times have reduced it
to a simple maxim;take care of yourself, get all you
can, and do all you can for those who elected you; which
does not mean the multitude, but a certain intriguing few,
the demagogues of caucus

I incline indubitably to derivate this word from an ancient
sourcethere seemeth a certain similitude in the sounding thereof

nomination, to whom both
the people and their representatives are but tools, and
with whom no honest man can thrive. But Mynheer
Vanderspeigl was born a philosopherhe heard little and
cared less what the world (which expressive word usually
includes no more than the circle of one's immediate
acquaintances
,)
said of himand that which would have
fairly turned the brain of another, scarcely disturbed his
accustomed quietude, or roused him more than a summer
zephyr would the sluggard waters of the Zuyder Zee.
Indeed he was a person of experienceearly he had left
behind him the miserable and comfortless hut, and
wandered
unpitied awayto what course not even the
sharpest
guesser could imagine:time rolled by and had
nearly obliterated his memory, for the poor and
miserable

that recall with pleasure or with pity that they have once
beenNo! to them the only words that speak their ha
ving existed are, poor fellow, I am glad he is out of his
misery; probably from the very lips that selfishly had
hastened the fate they thus commemorate; truly, there
are not many who will believe that the poor, the sick, and
the unfortunate have as fair a claim to life and the
sovereignty
which man holds on earth, as the most rich and
powerful that breathe the wanton airs of heaven.
However

as most strange and extraordinary things have
happened
,
so the eyes of the burghers of Nieuw Amsterdam
lightened as it were of a sudden, on a well filled winkel
that occupied the upper story or rather garret of the
weduwe Yokupminshe Van Schaik's new house, in the
pleasant straat called der Mayhden Paetje,

but besides this for business, the Mayhden Paetje had
other advantages, as it was the most public place of
resort
in the mighty stadt of Nieuw Amsterdam, as the very
first young women of the place, after milking the cows on
a summer afternoon, walked up its crooked paths for the
sake of taking an airing and hearing the love sighed tales
of the gallant Mynheers. In the long door of the loft
aforesaid on such occasions could be distinguished sundry
big-bellied Flemish jars, on which might be plainly read
in splendid letters of Dutch mettle the delightful words of
der goold water and der zilver water; and there too,
enveloped
in the smoke of his pipe, might be observed the
master of these liquids, the lofty Mynheer Sporus

As things moved on, aided by considerable custom
and close and economical living, the industrious
Nederlandter
was enabled to shut up shop; not in the modern
fashion by breaking at full credit, and leaving the
unfortunate
creditors to whistle for their demands, and then
setting up a carriagebut in a strait forward strict
Dutchman-like
manner, paying and being paid; so having closed
his affairs and wound up his business, Vanderspeigl (for
the heart even though hardened turneth fondly with the
affection
of a child for its mother, to the green spot of earth
whereon in youth we gamboled,) once more hastened to
seat himself by the side of his native river, determined to
grow fat on Esopus beer, to smoke his pipe in peace, and
to cultivate to his heart's content, sun flowers, holly
halks and cabbages. But alas! how short sighted are
human plans of happinesshow have the most knowing
been deceived,for attracted by the seeming ever
cheerful
temper of dame Van Schaikher merry chatting and
her gleesome jokesand then too what Dutchman of
susceptibility
could behold without emotion the forlorn state
in which the weduwe dwelt in her new house of the best
Holland brick, without wishing to console her in her
loneliness
and
then too, to think what an enticing hand she
was at pickling cucumbers, smoking red herrings,
drying
peaches, potting preserves, and tossing slapjacks
and then to behold her neatness as she overlooked the
scrubbing of the side walks of her dwelling, and sanded
the white floor of the zaal, carefully marking out
pretty tasteful Dutch figures on the boardsand then
too, to listen to the spiteful jingle of that great bunch of
keys that adorned her side, and know of the flask of
ancient
genever, of precious delft, and of cracked china
milk pots, that paraded the ample shelves of the
cupboard
;considering
these moving circumstances, where is
there a man who boasts the least Holland spirit but might
be led astray; and is it to be wondered at that wisdom
itself was triumphed over by such charms?but alas, it

Although, as has been told, Sporus was a man of few
words himself, yet he was a great admirer of eloquence in
others; indeed he would have made a wonderful jury
man, for long speeches acted by way of a soporific on
himand having this quality, he would have served to
sleep out the frothy, windy, sounding, and matterless
declamations
of certain of our modern advocates, who
always
take care to breathe forth sentences so very fine
and poetical that no one can understand them.Truly,
Sporus enjoyed company, an it were only to amuse his
eyes; and he had been with exceeding honour to

of Coentjes Slip, under the wide spreading shade of a

on a bright
and shiny Sunday afternoon; for the purpose of debating
and deciding on the aspect of the times, smoking their
tobacco
,
and quaffing wholesome draughts of beerand had
even smoked himself to be one of the first men among
them, though he had several doughty rivals to contend
with,in particular, Burgomaster Wyckoof, Mynheir
Kipp, and Krygsman Van Zaandt: the first of whom
being an echevin, and a heavier man, of course it was
natural
should have the advantage over him, not only in deep
and instinctive views of public matters, but in puffing and
blowinga prerogative of great men; the second was very
near his equal in wisdom; but then the last being a tall,
straight, fighting character, could beat all hollow at a story,
and easily run a-head in shuffle-board, nine pins, quoits,
cock and hens, and dominoes; in all of which games and
manly exercises, his descendants have been most
wonderfully
proficient, owing doubtless to their inheriting his
scientific and military attainments. Of all these
instructive
amusements and improving companions,
Vanderspeigl
was now deprived; he had never dreamt of their
not being an estaminet at Harlmand when the first
novelty of his landhuis was passed away, and when he
had sufficiently admired the fiery visages of his marigolds
and the huge jolly faces of his sunflowers, and was
somewhat
wearied at the scarce ever ceasing music of the
bullfrog
and the cat-bird, and had become accustomed once
again to all such rustic melodies and comfortshe was
surprised
and awe-struck to find that the shrill and harsh
notes of his loving spouse predominated, and kept his ears
busy, and his household in a clatter and confusion the whole
day long. As is customary with most husbands in his
desperate and melancholy situation, he became dogged,
sullen, and weary of the combat, in which as he grew
fainter, the more severely he was urged by his opponent;
and as might be expected from such matters, he shortly
gave in to his wifewho was one of those damsels who
knew no modesty in triumph, but pushed her conquest
to the utmost with a high and tyrant hand. Whether
from this or not, it is impossible to ascertain; yet on
settling
in their neighbourhood, Vanderspeigl on his part
avoided the dwellers of East Chester as much as they
had formerly shunned him, and though the goed vrouws
made frequent attempts at sociability with his dame, yet
as she was possessed of one of those save-all dispositions
(and which was also in unison with her lord and master,
as the world would style him) that characterize many of
the hospitable ladies of the present century,she soon
taught them, though with perfect high-dutch politeness,
that as she was lineally descended from a hoogduisch
family of Amsterdam in the Low Countries, her father
having been a skipper on the Amstraccan canal, (and by
the by, of this parental dignity she often reminded
Mienheer
to his cost) she could not condescend to encourage
an intimacy with persons, who, if they had been aboard
of her father's trekschuit, would scarce have been
allowed
to look at the roef; and who knew nothing of the
accomplished
civilities of the beauties who frequent the
Cingel; it was soon therefore discovered that neither oley
koeks, katrinshe or smoked sausages, were to be feasted
on by them at Vanderspeigl'sand this added, in all
probability
,
to sharpen the wits of the disappointed masticators
against the insensible ferry owner; as soon after offence
had been taken, it was noticed (for when women are
determined
to find out something ill, they are lynx-eyed,
and far beyond the watchfulness of men) that Sporus,
with all his guilders, was but a paltry miserly nasty
little
fellow; and having laid down this broad foundation
of character, it became no hard task to raise a more
certain structure: nor was the poor man's wife suffered
to pass without reputation, for Vrauw Clopper, who was
a shrewd knowing woman, and always just in her
strictures
,
thought it hard that he, abused creature, should
bear all the blame, when he merely deserved a small
portion,and therefore, to put the saddle on the right
horse, she gave the dame of Barent Fonda a morning
call,and in the tide of important converse, she
ventured
to hint that she was convinced that Sporus, (
unfortunate
being,) bad as he was, would never have been so
outrageously mean, were it not for his helpmatewho
without mincing mattersand this the emphatic lady
assured
her hearers, she did not mind telling the person of
whom she was discoursing, to her very teeth; (of which,
nevertheless, she took prudent care, as she was no
promoter
of mischief) that she was a low, spiteful,
pride-becrazed
wretchwho would one day live to know her
betters; for it was a true proverb, that those who ride
a high horse, must take care they have not a sad fall.
From this situation of things, it is not to be wondered at,
that, what otherwise might have been considered a mere
whim, was now metamorphosed into a real peccadillo:
and it was very earnestly descanted on, that our
Dutchman
was seldom or ever in the habit of attending his
family (though Vrauw Yockupminshie was extremely
devout, pious and sincere, and in all spiritual things
mightily
godly given) either to the neighbouring conventicle
of master Baregrace Trebletext, or to the high
Hollandsche
sermons of Dominie Van Gieson; which he
snuffled forth weekly out of a huge and mighty book,
bound in parchment splendidly stamped, with thick brass
clasps, and other brazen ornaments; the whole of which
had been manufactured at Leyden, at the sign of De
Ruyter's
Head; and which, from its ponderous weight and
compactness, was a most awful specimen of antique
superiority
,
and the flimsiness of all modern publications:
and it was further reported about this persecuted
Nederlander
,
that when questionedhowever, during the
absence
of his wife,on those subjects which most pertain
to the good opinion of the world, (though you be a great
rogue otherwise) charity in public and church going,
that he would ruefully, at the interruption, take his long
pipe from his mouth, and after deliberately clearing his
throat and puffing away the smoke from his nose, which
rose in volumes from his lungs, would answer with
rapidity
;
for as has been related, he was prone to slowness
in action, and by no means garrulous, yet he delivered
quickly whatever few words he chose to honour his
hearers
with. Mein gotgot tam!would u hab ik von
breacher? Ik vill hab none of dien zottigheiddien
nonzenshde breaching be vrouws warkvivers wark
op myn ziel! Ik hab der vrouws breaching t'huis van
den ogtend tot den avondgot tam! vrom der buttoning
ob myn broek dill myn eysh are closhdmein got!
It is perhaps less to be wondered at, from the forced
solitude of his life, and that, as must be perceived, he
was withal, much addicted to the unrighteous vice of
interlarding his conversation with divers metaphors and
vivid illustrations, which the gued wives set down as
rank staring oaths, these numerous, disagreeable,
disadvantageous
and tough rumours, remained uncontradicted
in circulation; nor was Sporus a person disposed to stop
their progress; for they were of no moment to him; they
neither sickened him, nor took away his daily food: he
consumed his allowance with as hearty a stomach, as
though no one troubled themselves about him: and he
could shrug his shoulders with all people's talking: still
he had sufficient to employ the brief space, he
exercised
his mind and his tongue at home, with a stirring
wife and a thriving farm: for while the former filled his
house with a whole short-legged tribe of chubby clumsy
Dutch urchins, with bright and pleasure dancing eyes
and rosy cheeks, that vied with the cherry ere it burst
in its summer ripeness, and who with their loud and
cheerful halloos as they sportive gambolled round his
hearth with hose scarce gartered, drove away the little
silence that their `moeders taal' might be pleased to
allow
him; the latter ever greeted his sight with
increasing
stores; on his domain, the sweet sad warbling of the
reaper's voice, floated through long fields fresh and
beautiful
with luxuriant ripeness: here the tender buckwheat's
gay and snowy fruit, shook to the gentle southern breeze,
like the white tops of a turbaned host; there the yellow
beard of the Indian corn, glistened to the sun like threads
of brightest amber, or sparkling nets of gold that form
the silk-worm's summer palace, and many a gallant drake
gave amorous call to his speckled mate on the blue
waters
that softly glided in the front of his cheerful
mansion
,
and though `silently across the aspect of terrestrial
things, a chilling change had pennoned its wide flight,'
and the hoarse winds raved, and the clouds hung heavy
o'er the unsheltered earth, while the cold winter's ice
covered his grounds, and the white snow piled itself
before his door; yet rich stores of grain filled his ample
barns, and within his dwelling the crackling log sent
forth its life sustaining warmth; season after season,
seemed merely to revolve within the circle of unending
timeadding to his coffers and extending his comforts:
could then unhappiness disturb him? day followed
day to him with scarce a change; he possessed all; that
all wherein is comprised the ideal contentment and
enjoyment
of this worldwealth!no matter how gained,
how accumulatedit is still the high imperial type of
this earth's glory; and he that hath its sway, as is daily
proved beyond contradiction, holds a shield invulnerable;
against whose brazen breast, the breath of fame, the
giant strength of justice, equal with the poisoned dart of
envy, wither hurtless as a reed slung by the arm of
infancy
:but
by this time, the reader must be impatient for
a more intimate acquaintance with the Hollander, than
mere description; he must therefore be referred to the
succeeding section, with which the story whereon this
history treats, is more properly commenced.

THE BEGINNING OF A STRANGE STORY.
It was late in the fall of the year; the gloomy shades
of night were fast approaching, rendered darker by the
impending tempest; the wind howled low and
mournfully
through the dried and ice fringed branches of the
trees; and as it shook their bare and unclad arms, it
seemed to moan like a wailing spirit, that is restless with
the knowledge of coming evil: the wild forest wore a
cheerless livery, and where a lonely sallow leaf hung
quivering on the drooping spray, the last of its once
green brotherhood, it clung faintly and fearfully to its
hold, as an aged man to life, when all his friends are
gone; a melancholy emblem of the changes of the earth
speaking how passing is the pomp and vanity of all
created
things: the waves of the usually quiet creek were
agitated, and drove sullenly on, dashing heavily and
roughly against the beach, crested with clear and
sparkling
coronets of foam, that gathered on their tossing
heads like white flowers upon a dark and trembling
bush; here and there the brown backed tortoise
showed
himself on the waters as he swam alongwhile the
white mews, with wailing shriek, on slow pinions dropt
downward to the sea, and the long winged wild duck
hied to its oozy nest amid the sedge, whose lank spears
sank beneath the flowings of the breaking waves;
detached
masses of dense and misty clouds, chased each other
along the still and stirless heavens, seeming like the
fearless bands of a mighty army gathering to the conflict;
and now and then a white and straggling snow-drop, as
pure as its home, fell languidly through the aira token
of the coming drift: the sun, as is in northern climates,
long ere the joining of night and day, could be scarcely
traced on the stormy horizon, except by a sickly circlet of
dim and ghastly light, that at intervals broke through the
thick haze and rolling clouds, that covered the blackened
visage of the lowering sky: from the depth of the brake,
was heard the hideous howlings of the wolf, who,
frightened
,
sought his den; and the piteous cries of the
tameless
and prowling panther, swelled the passing blast: the
lithe brambles of the tangled copse and the deep hedge,
were verdureless; and shook in the nakedness of their
desolation: while their seared and decaying fruitage,
lay stricken on the dried earth, silent and desertedsad
memorials of the departed beauties, and the loneliness of
nature. Yet on the hill side the strait and lordly pine
towered upwards, its green boughs beprankt with foliage
darkas hung with votive wreaths by some sylvan
worshipper
,
flourishing in bloom amid the cheerless and
desolate scene, like the spirit of the good, which neither
misfortune, sickness nor poverty, can bend,while
around was the season of man's decay, when all of hope
hath fled and perished, and every thought and prospect
of futurity, are frowning and bleak with storms.
Upon the ground in front of the ferry house, a large
chesnut lay outstretched like some fallen giant, torn up
by its massive roots, the victim of some late and
appalling
hurricane. Its branches, which had once shot their
blossomed spires of silver upwards, and within the
arbour
of whose pleasant shade, whole flights of summer
birds had nestled, were now crushed and broken: and
the countless foliage that had decked them in the hour of
pride and majesty, lacerated, torn and dank with
rottenness
,
were strewed in decayed heaps about the scathed
tree, or were driven to dust by the unsparing wind along
Vol. I. 7
the uneven beach:composedly seated on the trunk of
this o'erthrown pillar of the wilderness, and contented as
though he had been a burgomaster, while drawing the
essence
of the tobacco which he was smoking from his pipe,
was placed the lordly Mynheer Sporus Vanderspeigl;
gazing with vacant eye at times on the heavy aspect of the
clouds, and on the labours of a stirring, sturdy, grey
wooled
negro; whom it is proper to introduce to the reader
by the nominal of Yonne, or rather without
disparagement
,
Mynheer Yonne Vanderspeigl: by which sounding
designations, he modestly chose to be addressed. Now
as names have become mere optional matters in latter
years, wanting neither law nor estate, to be changed or
modelled as the user chooses to wear them; for a
different
address is often a passport to creditand an
advantageous
cover, under whose disguise a foreign
vagabond
adventurer, and escaped convict, may pretend to
the part of an honest man: therefore Yonne's right to
these innocent additions, was beyond question; the more
so, as the only sinister design apparent in their adoption,
was a little prideexcusable, since now the rage for a
great appellation, is much more ridiculous than it was in
the simple black: and though there is known of no existing
kindredship between Yonne and his proprietorand to
which, were it not that modern example and philosophy
had exploded all doctrines that could be advanced, in an
insuperable difference of complexion, feature and race,
one might be inclined to suppose, from this bearing of
title;yet nevertheless, he had more right to a
respectable
surname, than nine out of ten of our great men
have, to that of honesty; or one of a thousand of our
cheating, shallow-brained, purse-proud, would-be nabobs,
to that of gentlemen. Indeed Yonne was the right hand
man of his master; his confidanthis ever ready
assistant
and adviser in all business of importance: garrulous
in consultation, and active in execution, he was, in
truth, after Ya Vrouw, the person of most consequence
on the Nederlander's domain; and with all his Dutch
breeding
,
one could not look without a deal of satisfaction upon
his open, good humoured visage; for though he could not
be estimated as having an uncommon share of beauty in
his dark countenancefor his eyes, which were of
extraordinary
magnitude, and bolted out from the sockets
like the same organs in the head of a beetle, appeared but
as huge white orbs, owing to his rolling the balls under
their lids;his nose likewise, an admirer of correct
proportion
,
might not have considered fit for a modelit
being extremely flat and large at the nostrils; though to
make amends for a broad red under lip, that like a
jutting
cliff o'erhung his chinhis huge mouth, which was
always widened by a grin, discovered a row of teeth white
as milk itself; added to these advantages, his cheeks were
decorated by sundry scars and seams, and his ears hung
with a pair of copper rings, which as ornaments, he
greatly prized: and though the fastidious might have
deemed his outward man unprepossessing, yet he owned
that simple purity of heartthat virtuous truth of soul,
that rendered him worthy of every trust with which he
was encharged; and Vanderspeigl gave him sufficient to do,
and keep his blood stirring; for while the Hollander took
his ease and rested from an hour's labouran exertion
that required for the heavy moulded Dutchman on an
average
,
ten hours out of twelve, of inaction and recovery of
windand oftentimes a day to come to his proper
stamina
,
Yonne, during such lapses of time, was the very
game-cock of the fieldsbustling in the cabbage garden,
and strutting among the Holland pinks and tulips, with
all the dimensions of a monarch; for while the mistress
made matters stir within doors, he pushed things on
merrily
without; delving, weeding, and driving away the crows
from the cornor making the shores of the creek
resound
with his loud and hearty laugh, as he joked the
traveller or the pedlar, while he schouwed him across
the rivulet; for Yonne's nature was as comely as his
heartmirthful as kind, in disposition: he was unlike
the servants of these times, who ape in vice their
superiors
;
for while the latter pilfer in the way of
business
,
the former follow the example, by trying it on their
masters: he was of a different speciesand that now
rarely to be found; he had foibles, but they were of the
cast that wronged none; he was a faithful creature, and
could it be otherwise? he had been bred up with his
master
;
the companion of his youth, he had for sixty years
fed from the same table and dish, and had slept under
the same roof:in a word, he had wintered and
summered
from infancy to age, in the same familyand in
them his being was wrapt up: the name of ingratitude
to him, was strange; though now, a word more acted on,
than any in the language: he never dreamt of stinging
the bosom that fostered him; proud to be the
dependant
,
of his owner, and almost equal by treatment, he went
cheerfully to his dutyand all prospered under his
assiduous
hand during the day; and when the dusky night
closed his task, ere he sought his little loft, which was
on a level with the swallow coops that were fastened on
the ferry-house wall, he would take his accustomed seat
on the well worn log that filled one corner of the huge
fire placeand while basking in the genial warmth of
his situation he would make the roof ring with his glee;
as, to the wondering urchins who regardless of his
colour, clung about his knees and neck, he would relate
the traditions of his mother, who had been brought from
the gold coast in a ship belonging to the Holland West
India Companyand which had been consigned to
Guysbert
Myndero, of Nieuw Amsterdam: and at times, for
the further amusement of his infantine audience, he
would to the sonorous chords of a crack-stringed violin
from which, with much grimace and many laborious
scrapings, he succeeded in producing a species of
melody
that might alone be compared with the soft tones
extracted
from the filing of a handsawblithely troll some
rude song. part English, part Dutch, and part African,
that would set all his hearers in a titter of delight.
Besides
this, Yonne had many other powers of sociability
he was the gazette of the whole country round; and
the honest Dutch neighbourhood, when any subject was
abroad, was always sure to hear the relation through the
medium of his tongue: there was not a wedding in
embryo
an
old witch to be burntor a pirate to be
gibbeted
,
but what he was the person best informed on
every matter concerning them: his brain was truly a
chronicle of recorded experience; stored with tales of
ghosts, Indian massacres, spukes and wood demons
innumerable
:
he could tell whole histories of the devil's
dans kammer and the Hellegatand never was there a
winding sheet curled in the lamp, or a stranger who had
fallen from the burning embers of the cheerful hearth,
but they were construed aright by the divining black;
he was therefore, in high favour and credit with the
goed vrouw, particularly as he had foretold that the day
was to come when she would ride in a coach drawn by
four long switch tailed mares, which were to come from
Coeymansand should yet live to carry her head as
high as the governor's lady herself; and it was a matter
of course, that his wife's favourite, was in this case
equally Mynheer's; and in indulging the whimsies of
Yonne, was one of the rare matters on which they
agreed.
Yonne, at the period herein deseribed, under the
immediate superintendance of Vanderspeigl, was busily
engaged in scraping and overhauling the bottom of the
schouw in which he daily laboured, ere it was laid up
for the winter; near him, bubbling over a brisk flame
which had been kindled from the dry brush wood that
lay around, stood an iron pot, heating with tar, from
which he was busied in filling the gaping chinks of the
boat, though now and then he would pause in his occupation
to address some passing word to his master, who, taken
up with the arduous task of smoking and thinking, would
merely assent to his words by a slow motion of the head;
or, as he felt the increase of the cold, and the nearer
approach
of the tempest, with a quick jerk of the pipe from
his mouth, and a shrug of the shoulder, he would bid the
black hasten his work.
Me tink him birate be a berry bad man, said Yonne,
as he stirred the boiling liquid and addressed Sporus in
one of the intervening conversations, which were
occasioned
by some necessary hindrance of his pursuit,
Massa Boomelhyser say him kill neegur man to gard
him gooldder brute! him hab no boweltink neegur

,then
apostrophizing his work, he continued, ter

Ja! Ja! drawled out his half dozing auditor,
between long intervals of heavy breathing and puffing,

The black's visage lighted instantly up with a smile of
satisfaction at this high encomium, in having the sense of
his words compared to the profound reason that actuates
the speeches of their heerships, the lords of the city in
council assembled,that showed the double fence of ivory
which guarded his mouth from ear to ear; and it is
understood
,
from the chronicles extant of the enlightened era
which is here treated of, and which in most things
resembled
the present improved times, that Vanderspeigl's
discrimination
in the matter was extremely accurate; for
it appears that their mightinesses, like our own puissant
aldermen, were much addicted to silence in city affairs,
and only spoke
sensibly
and
interestingly
at large, before
voting on giving a contract or bestowing an office, and it
has also been made certain by deep research, that as the
present test on taking a place under government,
municipal
or national, is to make what you can out of itso the
ancient burgomaster took the oath of allegiance, by
swearing
to maintain the reformed religion in conformity to the
word of God, and

Dordrecht

and in other matters to promote public good, whilst it
served his own purposes. However, it is but just to these
by-gone dignitaries that their histories should not be
wrongly inserted, for the former part of the test was that
which they spoke with a loud voice, while the latter was a
mental reservation, and like all mental determinations, was
kept strictly to the letter; but perhaps it is erroneous
thus to hazard remarks on persons of such heavy heads
and stations, whether living or dead, for the inditer is
innocent
and unlearned as to what is proper in such great and
profound characters, whose dignity is in reality sublime, and
this, though well-meaning, might be construed into scandal,
and as it hath been demonstrated, there is but small change
of sentiment or power among them from former days, he
might be forced to suffer the ancient punishment of the
wooden horse
[29]
[29]
In Dec. 9th, 1638, two soldiers were condemned to sit two
hours on the wooden horse.
Records of Nieuw Nederlandts
.
The wooden horse, it appears, was a military punishment in
general
,
though sometimes a civil one, and was often used in Holland
and her dependencies. It consisted of a large wooden horse, ten or
twelve feet high, with a very sharp back; the culprit's legs were
fastened
with a chain to an iron stirrup, and sometimes a weight was
affixed to the feet. The editors of the city, are men of taste, science,
and the Lord knows what not; they have set the ladies crazy with
riding, which, it must be admitted, most of them do in a very
masculine
manner, being
always prepared
, and having no
fear
of
falling
,
leaving that for the spectator; now it only wants their
recommendation
to have this animal revived, and become a complete fashion,
and as the Sicilian tyrant was fain to have the inventor of the
famous
brazen bull make the first trial of its efficacy, so our
Corporation
would do a favour and a benefit to the public at large, to allow
the encouragers the first mounting: there are Colonels, Lieut.
Colonels, and Majors among them, plenty of officers though no
soldiers, and as it is known they all want courage, a wooden horse
would be more safe than a live one, particularly as the horse and
its riders' faculties would assimilate, being all of wood.
Note
from an original Essay transcribed by the Pr. Dev.
; or like Jan Hobbes, the early Dutch
satirist
,
who had the audacity to write a classic hollandsche
distich, by way of compliment to one Burgomaster
Ezel-een
Mensch, who sold lumber near the Webber's Kreek,
This was towards Corlears Hoek:
wherein he stated in verse that would have become a
Johannes Secundus, that when Ezel-een's yard was empty,
(to wit of lumber,) his head was full, and that the thickest
block he possessed, was his own skull, which Hobbes writes
kop
, in the original; this, however unfortunately,
Echevin
Mensch did not altogether rightly understand, for he
was a strong stomached Dutchman, and rather hard of
digestion, owing doubtless to his extreme ignorance and
his not having studied the learned Dutch authors, for it
is reported, that when he was a child, being more lacking
in sense than children are in common, he used to run
without broeks and play with the hogs, and from these
animals his manners being formed, the term `hoggish,'
in stating a man's perfections, hath arisen, and was first
applied to this renowned burgomaster; who, from these
causes, was utterly unable to take and relish the delicate
allusion to his business and his mind, contained in Jan
Hobbes' poetry, and he therefore commanded his two
Schepens, before whom, as he himself was an interested
person, the cause came on to be tried, to order that the
said Jan, his guilt not clearly appearing in evidence,
should be
punished
that a confession might be extorted
from him by
torture
; therefore the presumptive satirist
was sentenced, to allay the irritated and delicate feelings
of the burgomaster, to pay four stuyvers, when it was
known he was not worth a groat, and also to stand in
the rasphouse door at the ringing of the bell, and
humbly
and contritely beseech the magnanimous Ezel-een
Mensch's pardon.

From the conclusion of the black's speech, it will be
perceived that he was no mean observer of the course
pursued towards criminals in the province, and it may be
fairly deduced from his words that there is not a great
alteration
in our own era, for now probably, even more
than the period spoken of in this volume, riches have
their influencegold in the hands of any man is the
strongest passport that can be held;if even a murder is
committed, juries are tampered with by those whose
situation
as public officers demands that they should prosecute.
Judges themselves become but mere tools of corruption
and should even the public outcry call for a
condemnation
,
so rank the crime, that not even premeditated and
artful delays will serve, and should the solemn mockery of
trial be gone throughwhat is it alla farce! Go hunt
the prisons; they are filled with wretched losels, beggars,
who had not wherewithal to bribe, or whose crimes were
forced upon them by mere want, by bitter misfortune and
accidentthese have no friends, but wear away their
lives in sad and solitary wo, while he who was unfit to
breathe the free air, whose black heart swelled with
wickedness, hath been set at large; his wealth hath
loosened the chainhe crossed the threshold of the
dungeon

but his pardon was in his pocket
. Think not
from what here hath been set forth, that this is but the
fevered railing of one disgusted by petty wrongs, and
who gazes on all things with a jaundiced eye, making
mountains from sand hillsfar from it: there is not a
word in this paragraph, to prove which, examples are not
easy to be pointed outthey need not far to be gone for
they are even at hand
.

in answer to his slave, blowing with the labour

continued
somewhat more briskly, as with unusual haste he

negro pettishly, some dime one ting, some dime nuder,

But it was not in the nature of the garrulous and even
tempered African to remain long put out or displeased
with any body or thing, for having quickly discharged the
momentary bile in these ejaculations which Sporus's
admonition
had called forth, he shortly turned again to his
testy companion, and with a complaisant grin, sought to
join in his anticipations of a tempestuous night.

Ja! Ja! growled the Mynheer, whose
crabbedness
was rather increased as he felt the air grow sharper
with cold, and feeling somewhat worried at having the
tranquillity of his mind disturbed by his attention being
called to listen to Yonne's ill-timed addressmien Got!
dien clipper klapper, dien taal, dosh as moosch wark ash

he continued, puffing clouds of smoke from his mouth,
and blowing like a swimmer between every three or four
words, der sneuw ish naa by, op myn ziel, dou praater
mak haast; ich mun smoke mien byp mit beace, so
holdsch dien tam blaffing, negur.
The black well knew the sudden changes of his owner's
humour, and therefore forbore answering him, but
grumbling
sourly, in a few half whispered and unintelligible
sentences, expressive of discontent, he proceeded to
apply
himself solely to his work, which soon rapidly
progressed
,
and the ringings of his busy hammer were loudly
and oftentimes repeated; yet Yonne's thoughts were not
engaged with his labourshe had been barred in the very
moment he was entering on the relation of an important
subject
;
in truth he was swelling with news, and he felt like
some talkative gossip who receives an offence at the
opening
of her budget, and though provoked to silence, wants
but a word's concession to loosen the strings of the whole
communication, and at last fearful of receiving no
encouragement
or hearing, of her own will, details her story,
amply and at large, as it were out of mere wantoness;
and thus it was, that not even the long drawn puffs, the
half closed eyes, and the nodding head of the nederlander,
which bespoke, that in spite of the weather and of care,
he was making himself as easy and comfortable as any
Dutchman could be in his situation, were able to deter
the slave, brimful of his subject and unmindful of his late
repulse, from again breaking on Vanderspeigl's quietude.
* * * * * But ere proceeding with the narration, (and
indeed the matter grows out of Yonne's situation,) it seems
as if it ought to be remarked, that though it is certain all
are greedy, selfish, and avaricious, without generosity in
most matters, so that it may be fairly supposed that it is a
principle of civilized society that any thing bearing a value
obtained by one should be denied another by the very hand
that hath been gifted, yet in some affairs of moment and
import there is an unbounded and liberal feeling, and the
first among these that is given without a seeking or a
demand
of return, is the fame of the day, the current of
passing intelligence, the reports and rumours, which are
the existence and the moving breath of the crowd, that
flies from mouth to mouth swift as a signal on the
mountain
;
for in truth, it is seldom but what the person who
hath received aught that he deems interesting or strange,
is anxious that others should share his wonderment, and
he is no more to be obstructed in his intention, though
met by coldness and even frowns, than the swollen linn,
that dashing down its rude and worn channel in the face
of the hill, is to be changed or dammed up from its
irresistible
and brawling journey by the splintered shrubs
and shattered pieces of rocks that it hath washed in its
way, or that hath been cast from the overhanging cliffs to
impede its passage; truly the earth is overstocked with
beings of this species, ever active newsmongers, who
would scarce be known to have stirred in an honourable
action, but are still of so free spirited a disposition that
their whole business is to fetch and carry informationif
in the heat of argument an irritable word falls from one,
they are sure to let it be known to whom it may concern;
not as truly spoken, but larded with their own conclusions,
and then when the hearer hath expressed himself in return,
all is brought back to the original speaker, and after that it
becomes their part to let the world into the secret; surely
the idea of these disgusting insects, whose brains are thus
stored, and whose venomous tongues are thus urged to
activity, calls in view the flight of a busy, buzzing
blue-bottle
,
who sounds his wings with great noise and beats
actively against the window pane without impression, but
yet though insignificant, is troublesome; for however
contemptible
are these constant bearing and ever talkative
gentry, so slight is public belief and confidence, that many
times their adsurdities thrust them into consideration, for
the bustle and appearance they assume are apt to deceive,
and are calculated to impose on the ignorant and
unreflecting
,
who contribute largely in the formation of the
crowd: for the surface is that which soonest attracts the
eye, and there the lightest air blown bubble always swims
that this is true must be obvious, for it is not to be
supposed
,
that the possession of great abilities, so often as
a moving, noisy nature, aided by the influence of accident,
have brought men forward or lifted them from a lowly
sphere; it has happened that many a hollow but strong
lunged blockhead hath been thrown in a place of
consequence
,
for the world goes to great lengths when once it
sets out, and when once a man is raised a step above his
fellows, he is pushed up in spite of his own dullness to the
very top of the ladder, and while so exalted, the
adoration
of a blinded mob, (for there is no reasoning with a
popular rage, however ridiculous,) even though his
baseness
be as vivid as light, it is in vain to deny him talents
and acquirements, as stragglers from the opinion of the
great mass and herd, the world, are sure to be considered
envious or foolish; indeed, in many instances, the same
thing that calls attention to a village bellman, raises to
notice a beer house politician, or whence are public trusts
held so commonly by characters of the meanest and lowest
description, if not that they bully themselves to power, or
that designing men, believing them from their hot,
senseless
,
and unquiet spirits, fit puppets to gratify their
private
malice, intrigue, ambition, or avarice,for who is
more capable of wallowing in dirt and filth than those who
have been bred amidst them,have helped them to
authority
and power, which their vulgarity and ignorance
render
contemptible as well as disgraced: and there cannot be
a more singular difference than in the conduct and bearing
of these hour raised mongrels while mixing in the
common
duties of life with their equals, and while robed in
the insolence of the functions of their ill borne greatness:
in the one, they are on the level with their kind, bending to
their constituents and fawning and cringing to their
superiors
;
in the other, swelled and conceited with ideas of
their own vast importance; they are haughty to those
above them, and overbearing to those below them;
dressing
themselves in all the vulgar airs of affected
greatness
,
acting a part to which hitherto they have been
unknown
;
they almost conceive themselves of a higher class
and finer mould than the rest of mankind, but having
neither
opinions, thoughts, or actions that are their own,
moving without reason, method, or sense, they soon are
made the mere jests and tools of the wary; but what else
could be expected? If you place a butcher in a
legislative
hall to make your laws, doth he not partake of the
stupidity of a bull? If you take a potter from his jars and
jugs, and set him to enact statutes, will they not be as
empty as his ware? Drag a hatter from his line of
business
,
is not his skull as hollow as his work ere it is used?
a mason's brains are, in government, as hard as the brick
he was born to lay; and a publican, though he may be
able to guard his till, and measure out drams, knows but
little of finance or public measures, except what he might
have gathered from tap room knowledge and wit. How
Vol. I. 8
far nobler would it be, were men more diffident, did they
not endeavour to make themselves ridiculous by aiming
at stations for which they are unfit, but keep to those which
were allotted them by education; were this the case there
would be a lack of that host with which we are now
over-run
,
barefaced and insolent upstarts, who, without
foundation
,
pretend to every thing. To the conceited greatness
and impudent self-filled consequence of such, the Records
of Nieuw Nederlandts present an excellent lesson in the
humility and condescension of that worthy ancient,
Whamuldus
Schermerhorne, of Schenectadie, who being
preferred
to the trust worthy and dignified situation of dog
whipper for that famous city, attended Dominie Meir's
lecture
the Sunday after his exaltation without any feeling of
pride or elation, which he modestly, as he entered the
kerk, evinced, for as he waddled towards his pew under
the pulpit, at the commencement of a solemn portion of
the dominie's service, to unite with which, the pious
Dutch congregation had arisen from their seats, and by
which motion, the sapient Schermerhorne understood they
were paying respect to him; yet nothing puffed up by
this mistake, which might have raised the head of any
man, the worthy Hollander, bowing humbly and with
profound lowliness, so that his nose almost touched the
ground, an exertion in so fat a man of no ordinary kind,
exclaimed in a loud voice that all might have the benefit
of his wordsBy myn ziel, dish ish doo musch, Ik ish
nien lift up mit mien brosberity
Ik ish but a man;
so
were the persons just written of, to remember they were
but men, and what kind of men they
had
been; it would
be much more creditable to their modesty as well as sense.
Hiatus in MSS
.
And now having concluded to my own satisfaction this
important theme, the necessity of entering on which,
easily excuses its length, and the propriety of which I
leave entirely to the judgment of the reader, who, I have
already found, a most gentle, courteous, and candid
personage
,
I will straightway and with great alacrity go back
to where we first set out, if he so desire it, and will
accompany
me thither; for indeed our friend Yonne's words
have been a long while on the end of his tongue, and the
poor fellow has been bursting to speak could he have found
an opportunity, but as no one has been in a hurry to hear
him, I have not cared much to attend to his discourse; yet
as some one or the other will take up this volume, to
whom the state of disposition and opinions laid down, will
not give a moment's concern, but whose whole heart will
be placed on the unravelling of the important tradition
with which this section began, and as I am a very obliging
author, always minding the admonitions or wishes of the
peruser, I am minded to let all the odds and ends of
matters
for a time take care of themselves, and once more
journey towards the pith and marrow of the business in
right earnest, on which account an attentive application is
recommended to all that follows.
SECTION II.Pursued.
Him no hear vat Massa Boomelhyser tell 'bout ven

aloud, as if to himself, yet in a way to awaken his master's
curiosity, and rolling at the same time his large eyes on
one side, so that he might note the effect of what he spoke
on the dormant faculties of the lazy Hollander, ony

which appeared to intimate that he was more asleep than
awake, catch him det a cold, sartainhim no hear,

It is not a slight thing that will stir a man of
equanimity
,
and of the placid temperament of the ferry master;
but nevertheless, the tighter the cork be driven in, and
the slower it yields to the screw, the more wind, spirit,
and fire when it once comes from the neck of the flask,
may be expected from the liquor; therefore, he that is
slow to anger, when once aroused, is sure to be more
fierce than one who blazes at every spark, catching like
tinder; so though the bosom of man may seem impervious
to the slightest emotion, yet there are times when some
chord being stirred, we are surprised that the feelings
are so acute and quick, having heretofore beheld nothing
but a strange indifference; but that string when moved
must be a home onethat which winds about the heart
itself. Whether the last was the cause in this case, or
that Vanderspeigl had a mind to circulate his blood,
and give a specimen of his activity, it is difficult to
determine
,
but he had scarce heard Yonne's intelligence
through, ere, with singular velocity, his eyes started
wide open, and his hand, with equal despatch, snatched
the pipe from his mouth, which naturally from the
movement
of the muscles of his face, was left full ajar,or
what may be more probable, in his haste of action, it
being
a minor thing, he had neglected to close it, not (
forgetting
however, at the same time, to make a gulp and
swallow down suddenly the smoke which might have
remained
in his jaws,) while, with astonishing rapidity,
considering
the mould, he raised that inert and ponderous
load, his body, on the support of his legs; indeed, the
whole pantomime was in the true stage style, and would
have called down applause from all judges, who are
now-a-days
lamplighters, editors, scene-shifters, and all other
blackguards, hired by managers to force on an audience
lascivious spectacles and bawdy dialogues: it is
incumbent
,
however, to mention that the facility of enactment
just described, it is probable, might have been inherited
by Sporus from his `grootvader,' who was a stage
sweeper
at Saardam, to one Van Worst, a great fat, greasy,
gin-swelled, duck-legged, beastly knave, who kept a
beer byt or bear garden, for the amusement of the
rabble
.Mien
Got!Got tam, cried he, speaking quickly
with the peculiar emphasis, that belonged to his
gutteral
enunciation, and then pausing a considerable time, as if
fairly to get rid of the ejaculation, he added rapidly, vat
dis dou dells, der zeerover in der oost vloedYonne,
mien bloud ish cold, mien vingers, mien pones dremble
op myn ziel, tish nien drue, negur, niet waar Ik saai, Ik
hab mien dout, and having thus delivered himself, he
with all the quietness and calmness possible after so
terrible
a squall, comfortably reseated himself, and resumed
his pipe, leaving the amazed black to gaze at him with
the utmost astonishment, for although Yonne had
sometimes
beheld the placable Nederlander fly into a vagary
or so, which either came up to or exceeded the cause of
his surprise, and had heard him execute the delivery of
many staring oaths with the like flourishes, yet it was
seldom
that these were performed, except when the worthy
burgher's peaceable disposition had been alarmingly
wrought on to the full bearing of his manhood and
patience
,
or when fairly put out of countenance at being
sadly driven, teazed, and provoked by the never ceasing,
and bitter attacks of his helpmate; but that any thing else
in the world should have, at such a rate, moved or stirred
him up, was not only singular, but alarming,and direful
misgivings and strange thoughts ran riot through the fertile
brain of the faithful slave. That the announcement of
what had been formerly an every day occurrence, (though
for several months past it had not happened,) that a
rover's
barque was lying in the waters of the sound, whose
neighbourhood, however to be dreaded, had heretofore
only been of detriment to the poultry yards and the
cattle
of the Nederlanders, the numbers of which always
diminished at these visits of the buccaneer, but which
were amply repaid by the rich trade that was sure to
follow
their arrival, among the merchants, pedlars, and
speculators of the island of Manathanthat this could
have awakened the frigid torpidity of Mienheir
Vanderspeigl
8*
seemed nearly incredulous, a matter unaccountable,
and indeed Yonne did not know what to make of it, so
having looked sufficiently at the visage of the sturdy
Dutchman, he bethought himself that it would be of no
use whatever to again repeat the correct, straight forward,
and not to be doubted source and channel from whence he
had derived the rumour, for he was well acquainted with
his proprietor's hatred of being contradicted; for when
Vanderspeigl asserted black was white, or any other
disputable
position, if his words were not instantly assented
to, he was sure to be as quick, surly, testy, and crabbed,
as a snapping turtle himself, and it was all along that his
wife's manner and customs were in this matter the very
counterpart of his own, that the poor man dragged out
such an intolerable existence, that his temper was ruined,
and his flesh like a jelly on his bones; since, though it
may be a very romantic theory, that when taste and
dispositions
assimilate in a married couple, they are the
certain
sources of conjugal happiness and contentment, yet
the truth is widely against such interpretation, and
Mienheir
Sporus and Vrouw Yokupminshie, proved the latter
in every sense of the word for nothing could be farther
from happiness than as they lived yet on whom the fault
rested will not here be determined; but still it is no more
than just and impartial to say that ya vrouw herself stated
with great feeling, that she was obliged to preach from
morning to night, and yet it was to no purpose, for Sporus,
do what she would, was never satisfied, and so it appears
the poor woman talked herself as lean as a razor in her
dutiful endeavours to make her spouse cheerful, while he,
in spite of her affection, (as she most pathetically
affirmed
,)
ungrateful dog as he was, continued as dogged,
contrary, and cross-grained, as if he was possessed, which
truly, to the amiable creature was vastly provoking; for
though the obstinate mule of late never ventured to
speak a word in return to her gentle and admonitory
rebukes, yet what worried the kind soul almost to death,
was that he would look at her glum, sour, and ill-natured
as old Nick himself. Now all this had, in a certain degree,
a weight and influential power on the observing, acute,
and close viewing mind of the shrewd negro, and
therefore
having gone completely through the subject by
conjecture
,
and finding without satisfaction, that both in
thought and supposition he was drained to the very
dregs, or in other words, that every idea he could
muster on the occasion relative to the matter which he
strived to develope, was entirely ran out without
confirmation
,
he thought it of moment to wind up the business
by coming to a conclusion, in which he definitely
considered
that at present it was adviseable as his safest plan
to say not a word more on the matter, as it would be of
no use or service for him, if not certainly dangerous and
hazardous, to broach to his master's hearing aught
further
that had been spoken by the worthy Mienheir
Boomelhyser
;
for though the storm of Vanderspeigl's mind
seemed to be entirely blown away, it was wise not to give
it fresh cause to feed on, were there any hunger left: and
of a surety in this, Yonne argued in a sound, cautious,
and discretionate manner, and with reasoning cool and
dispassionate
,
and it might have been that he drew the
foundation
of this logic from his experience entirely, for the
forest and the wild hill and bitter labour had been his only
books, and there are few better, saith a wise old saw;
though it must be confessed their lessons sometimes
direfully
puzzled and bewildered his woolly pate, as in one
instance fell out while slooping to Coxsackie, up `de
noordt rivier,' at the time his master hired him to old
Cobus
Kuypers, of Waappinger's Kreek, for as he came by
the Shaangum Mountain, there blew up a devil of a squall
which in a moment set the craft on her beam ends, and
in the snap of a finger, swung the spanker boom about
with such velocity, that forgetting all ceremony, it took
the luckless skull of the black in its way, whirling it,
together
with the body adjoined, into the water; now,
though this was rather a severe warning, yet it had its
effect, for when in a pitiful plight, by the aid of the
leeboard
,
he got on deck after his sousing, he bethought
himself that all was owing to his want of civility in not
getting out of the road for his betters; he therefore
gathered
wisdom from his misfortune, as rubbing the bruised
seat of wisdom, he exclaimed, Loramitetee be prase
ony tink now, me nebber put dis cokernut in de way agin,
sartinven me do he velcom to gib nuder slapnow it
is no more than to be believed, that this remembrance
had its force in the resolution which he had settled for
his conduct, as above amply descanted on; though for all
this, one might incline to think that he had equally in
view the correct, memorable, erudite, and impartial
decision
of that sound just, and learned Dutch civilian,
Dirk Von Rikkettie, of Nieuw Amsterdam, who will be
found figuring to no small advantage in one of the latter
books of this remarkable tradition;but to the case in
point, wherein it appears that skipper Van Wycke, of Sing
Sing, was complainant, and old Mutchin Brinckerhoff, a
ragged, lousy, beggarly, brazen, shirtless, breechless
vagabond
,
without a character or a coat to his back, stood
defendant; and thus it was,while the respectable `
roeyer's
slupe' lay snugly harboured in der Breede-Gracht,

which was on the top of the
market
house, right in the very centre of business, for
he had arrived with a valuable cargo of radishes,
manure
,
and aard apples, and while the skipper, who had
brought for him a great round Yonker's cheese, was
comfortably
drinking a zoepje of peach brandy, and smoking a
friendly pipe with his cousin Mienheir Van Kortlandt
under
the cover of the great locust tree that stood before
his mill door in der molen weg, or the mill straat as it was
most usually called; that strapping knave, old Mutchin,
who had been watching his opportunity, for the artful dog
was at all times about, poking his nose in places where
he ought not to have been, and where nobody wanted
him, slipt away with an old copper basin, the skipper's
clam knife, and the cover of a high Dutch psalm book,
upon which Van Wycke's name was written by the
dominie
in a flourishing Hollandsche textnow Van Wycke
who was a tall, strong, raw-boned, six foot giant of a
Dutchman, with huge staring black whiskers, and great
long lanthorn jaws, set great store by these articles, and
when he found they were gone, he swore horribly, and in
a towering rage he advertised them in the Post Boy,
offering
a reward for their recovery of a vier stuyver stuk,
and a skipple of meal, and soon traced them to a hovel in
Rotten Row,
[32]
[32]
This place was at the end of the Old Slip.
the residence of Mienhier Brinckerhoff,
whom he brought by the nape of the neck before the
redoubtable
and incorruptible Dirk Von Rikkettie, and in a
blunt, Low Dutchman-like way, informed that sapient
judge of his wrongs. Now Dirk having limped forward
on their entrance, for he was a truly courteous man, and
very condescending withal, though monstrously deep in
law, greeted both parties kindly, inquiring after their
vrauws and little ones, together with their own healths
and after shaking hands, began with a very profound
visage
to maturely weigh the state of the case in his own
mind;now it should be premised that Dirk mortally
hated the whole race of Van Wyckes for they were of the
old government interest, and he had joined the other side
ever since they were in powerand he also well knew
that old Mutchin was as noisy as he was dirtyand could
lie, toss coppers, and vote in every corner of the stadt at
an election time, when either a Burgomaster or Schepin
was to be chosenso after fitting and proper time his
mind was made up, and in a clear audible voice he began
to deliver his judgment:first he set forth with a
compliment
to the high standing and well known
respectability
of the persons concernedthen he diverged sapiently
in quotations from Puffendorf and Grotius, together with
many other legal authorities, whose writings were
appropriate
first
he appeared to lean to one side of the
question
,
then the other equally balanced itthen he had
select
cases from unknown juridical reportsthen he stated
what would have been the opinion of Jan Erasmus in the
businesslumbering out and tossing over the whole
substance
of the statutes of Nieuw Nederlandts, like a
skittish
Flemish mare who switches her long tail about her,
sending the mud on all sidesso that for a long while it
was uncertain how matters stood. At last, after having
kicked up a surprising dust by thus beating around in
every direction, and solemnly taking every bearing of the
compass that was visible, he slowly sought to bring
matters
into a narrower compass by ordering the honest
Mynheer Brinckerhoff to be set at large, and advising
him immediately to seek a remedy against the skipper
for false imprisonmentand also with a very stern
countenance
,
which he however asked Van Wycke's pardon for
putting on, as it was impossible for him to look
otherwise
on so serious and dignified an occasion, he proceeded
to admonish the skipper for his carelessness in leaving
temptation in the sight of Brinckerhoff, who had the
articles
not been imprudently exposed, would never have
had an idea of taking them; and he (Dirk) therefore
could not but consider it as justice, that might in part
sooth the wounded honour of Mynheer Mutchin (and the
law allowed greater latitude of severity, but he refrained
from the exercise,) if he sentenced Mynheer Van Wycke
to pay all the expenses of the trial. At this the skipper
could not help, in spite of the awe that pervaded him at
the research and talents of the judge, ripping out a huge
swinging oath, and giving his mustachios an undaunted
and defying twist that made all stare again, and was
about to make an appealbut Dirk, interposing, said he
had not yet finished, for that on account of the
complainant
being a resident of another county, he was doubtful
of his jurisdiction in the business, and he therefore supposed
that the affair of the costs would be best referred to a
higher tribunal. And then finding it time to dismiss the
court, he invited the skipper to walk home to his house
and take a drink of brandtwyn with himat the same
time thanking Van Wycke as they went along, in the
name of the Stadt, for the inflexible activity with which
he prosecuted offenders against the laws.
Now doubtless it is apparent to every mind of
reflection
,
that this judgment was the best at every point for
the parties themselves and the public good, that the
state of the affair admitted; for had it been determined
otherwise, Mutchin might have been put in the pillory,
and been thrown out of his livelihood, though it was
difficult
to say how the fellow lived, yet he made out to get
along some how or other; and losing its head and stay,
his whole family would have been broken up and gone to
the `werkhuis,' and so have been a great expense to the
vroedschap, while on the other hand, the unsuspecting
skipper would, not thinking of the matter, have placed
some new temptation in the way of somebody else, and
there would have been another trial and more time lost,
now all this was foreseen and adroitly avoided by the
inimitable decision of the immortal Dirk: and thus it was
with the sapient Yonne, for as he had not the least desire
that his head should again be where it was in danger of a
rough salute, it struck him thoroughly that he ought not
to put the smallest temptation in the view of his testy and
irritable owner, so without more ado abandoning
Vanderspeigl
entirely to his internal cogitations, in one tenth part
of the time which has been taken to relate it, the negro
once again resorted and assiduously applied himself to
the finishing of the labour in which he had been engaged.
Meanwhile the vapours that had hovered darkly upon
the heights, gathered their dusky mantles over the
distant
prospect, and the hoar frost hardened as the night
approached near, and as the light grew fainter, the aspect
of the long line of woods that skirted the river was
continually
changing; first could be distinctly marked mighty
and majestic groups of trees even to the delicate fibres
that like smooth long grass hung to the rough bark and
twisted boughs, nor were branches of minor growth hid,
the lithe and prickly stems of the wild rasp, the orange
hipp and the percimen whose berries had been the food of
autumnal birds, rustled and bowed their tender heads as
the blast raved by; now like a colossal column some
broad trunked and gnarled oak, whose scathed coat was
whitened by moss that had been growing a hundred years,
could be distinguished, erect in isolated and spectral
grandeur
,
a leader in the forest, while mingling with its
shadow
,
like attendants to its glories, the brown fir, the proud
cedar, the noble elm, and the wild mountain ash, cloaked
in their russet garbs, blended their multitudinous arms into
a darksome net work; but in a short time all was mingled
and merged in a sable and undefined mass, whose broken,
scattered heaps, seemed like the black armour of a giant
carelessly strewn amid the surrounding obscurity. The
snow fell faster from its invisible palace in the cloudsits
drifting and feathery flakes, now melting in their flight,
anon resting on the earth white as purity, while the
brown soil of winter grew chequered with its touch; at
intervals broke on the ear, through the melancholy
swelling
of the wind, the plashing of some waterfall, that like
the floating mane of a courser in flight, leapt adown the
mountain's rocky side, here concealing itself as it rapidly
trickled amid a cloud, over-hanging swamp wood and dying
brush, that strung with icicles, the frozen drippings of
the wave, glittered dazzlingly even in the night above
the clear transparent waters; here bounding forth over
the smooth worn stones that choaked the ravine, it
rushed
into the stream belowthe voice of the wilderness,
the appalling and gloomy solitude around, the sublime
and time enduring forms, among which nature alone was
paramount, all seemed scorning the weak invasion of man,
with a comparison of the insignificance and transitoriness
of the arts, enjoyments, and occupations, and of the brief
duration of human existence itself.
And now that ruthless and uncourteous ancient
impartial
time! who tarrieth not for manbe he high or
lowoverflowing with riches, or stricken with poverty
but with the same rapid and unerring stride, passes o'er
the king, priest, or peasant; the lord and slave; the
festal of the victor, and the despair of the vanquished;
on his sure journey moved insensibly, though scarce
noted
;
while Yonne, though driven hard by desire, for his
soul was of that o'erflowing kind, that it was a task for
him to set bounds to his loquacityremained silent,
finding no favourable moment wherein he could indulge
himself by a renewal of conversation; at several
periods
indeed the words of a new subject were on the very
ends of his lips; and it was with much ado of grievous
exertion
,
that he restrained their utterance; being alone
forced to stillness, by the awe of his lordly proprietor's
humours: it is to be remarked, however, that Yonne,
although given singularly to earnest discourses, spoke
always to the purpose: and what he said, was preferable
in most instances, to the breathings of many who now
are of the like disposition: for truly, to be ever
chattering
like a noisy ape, is a superior qualification; since to
be taciturn in company, is a mark of vulgarity as well as
follyyet on the other hand, to engross the whole that
is talked, by senseless words and foppish grins, is not
only to be agreeable, but extremely talented and witty:
as such is the conclusion, it is in no wise astonishing,
that every brainless blockhead that is blest with a nimble
tongue, gives it full latitudetroth, 'tis disgusting to
walk abroad and mingle with the crowd, and have one's
ears deafened as it were by the hollow and ceaseless
clapper of a bell: for indeed there are but few circles
that have not their active mouthed idol, their privileged
jester and buffoon, whose mean and impertinent
liberties
of speech and contemptible dullness, are received
current for pleasantry and smartness; and who, though
an egregious ass, hath the best of countenance. It is
certainly to be highly regretted, that the judicious
reader
should thus have been forced by the untoward
disposition
of circumstance, to lose what the sagacious negro
would have spoken: still it is a true proverb that teaches
it is an `ill wind that blows nobody any good;' and so it
was with the black; for what was a deprivation to his
wishes, was a considerable gain to his employment, which
throve mightily in having no rival in his attention: for it
seemed with Yonne as with most peoplethat the more
fuss they make, the less they do: as is verified in the
proceedings
of certain assemblies; where the more they
discuss
a matter, the farther they are from bringing it to
perfection: and thus day after day, is wasted in
brawling
and childish disputesforeign to the purpose, as
unsatisfactory to the hearers: so that from
remarking
the management of large and mixed bodies,
wherein
seldom unity of action or sentiment prevails, it is
not to be wondered, there are many who would prefer
the sway of one ruler, than the corruption,
disagreements
,
Vol. I. 9
and intrigues of a dozen, who, when they do
agree on making a law, form it so that in case of need,
they may find a corner unguarded which may be turned;
and it is a close observance of this crafty principle, that
hath made so many of our statutes like the mesh of a
spider, which to be entangled in, is certain death to all
smaller winged insects; but for the buzzing bee, the
stinging wasp, the hornet, and other of the greater
species, it is no impediment: for wheresoever it pleases
them, they can with ease tear to rags every thread of
the web. As it may be expected from the premises
above set out, a much briefer space had been gone
through, than otherwise would have been necessary, ere
the boat was, by the dexterous and alert movements of
the slave, in a proper condition to execute its portion
towards the interest of the ferry-master: and soon
thereafter
,
that the object of his care might be safe from the
attacks
of the tempestuous weather already aroused, Yonne
snugly housed the repaired schouw under the shelter of
a neat straw-thatched schouwloots, that adjoined the barn
and dwelling; whose roof served the swallow to hang
his nest to, and where the martin and wren coops were
nailed; all of which from the past summer were silent,
deserted and decaying, making the dreariness of winter
more palpable to the heart, and visible to the mind: and
thus having concluded his toil, and shivering like an aspen
with the cold, to which he was more sensitive than his
hardy master, whose phlegm alone was enough to keep him
warm, the black proceeded with considerable alacrity,
(for the finishing of work, however worn down and fatigued
the labourer may be, is always the quickest,) to collect
together the implements that had assisted his skill, for the
purpose of conveying them with him into the mansion: it
nevertheless must be mentioned, that the speed of this
performance, was interrupted at intervals by the enactor's
being forced by the biting rigour with which his fingers
were affected from the wind, to call in the aid of sundry
stratagems, of rubbing, clapping, and blowing on the
numbed flesh with his breath, to keep his blood in
circulation
:
it was in the procedure of the latter, at a
moment when a somewhat long exposure had rendered an
extraordinary exertion necessary from the lipsthat while
bending his head in this pursuance, the bearing of the
negro
was attracted and his notice called from that on which
he was busied, by an afar off sound, which indistinct and
broken by the density of the air and weakened by its being
very distant, at first was scarcely distinguishable, but soon
grew stronger on the ear: Yonne stopped from his
occupation
,
and raising himself in an attitude of listening, he
strained every nerve to catch the origin of the noise, and
it was not a great while ere from the swiftness of its
approach
,
that his curiosity was satisfied; for as it became
louder and embodied itself, though from the darkness
and the white showers of falling particles of drift, that in
hosts thickened around, dark above but bright as sea
foam below, he could perceive nothing, yet soon he plainly
marked the dashing of the heavy hoofs of a horse at great
speed on the frozen ground, and whose course was
evidently
in the direction of the ferry house. An occurrence
so strange and uncommon was not a little surprising to
the black, who marvelled greatly thereat, since it was
but seldom the custom of traders or others, who
adventured
to thrid the lonely, scarce broken paths of the
wilderness
,
to pursue their solitary travel beyond the fall of
evening, but sometime ere its coming it was prudent as
well as necessary for them to shun danger by seeking
shelter from the hundred deaths that would, armed, spring
up to oppose their way, whilst environed with the
gloominess
and shadows of night; and further, it was entirely
out of the question to suppose for an instant that any of
the lusty Dutch colonists had ventured at so late an hour
without the precincts of their own comfortable
homesteads
;
and indeed both Nederlander and pedlar were too
knowing as well as careful of the wind of their sleek steeds,
to urge them at the rate with which the one that now
approached
was spurredconsidering these reasons, it is not
to be wondered at that various odd conjectures, surmises,
notions, and flighty ideas, gathered in almost the
swiftness
of a moment in Yonne's teeming and fruitful
imagination
so that his very brain swarmed again with fearful
visitations, as some how or other, (and there is no
accounting
for such things,) they are the maggots of the sense that
thrust their heads out of their holes at every turn; and thus
each dormant fear aroused in his mind, he bethought
himself
how it was said that the spirit of old Antony Colve a
fierce, storming, swearing dragoon of a Dutch Governor,
(who had been deprived of his power by an unfortuitous
peace between the United Belgick States and England, in
which the former ceded the colony of Nieuw Nederlandts
to the latter, and had consequently smoked himself to death
out of clear vexation,) was accustomed to ride round and
round the seat of his former government, the proud isle
of Manathan, on a winter's night, mounted on a fiery,
trampling, black war horse, that snorted vengeance on the
invaders of his master's rights; and so, shaking and
shivering
through his whole carcass as though stricken by an
ague, scarce able to hide his fright, the timorous negro
turned his eye towards his owner, as if to seek safety and
protection from his countenance, Mien goot Got!
dishish
drangeop myn ziel, tish niet him alrede, muttered
Vanderspeigl, somewhat perturbed and perplexed, for he
also was started from his reverie by the sound of the
galloping
.
Ja! ja! der ding ish twyffelagtigMien Got! Ik

As this speech took up considerable time, for the
Dutchman
paused between every sentence to collect his words
as well as breathe, Yonne had no opportunity to remark
in answer, for now the rider, whatever he might be, was
but a short space distant; the doubtful black, however,
as he hearkened breathlessly to the closer boundings of
the hoofs, could not refrain from whispering to himself,
Him no like a tradin massa horse, him ride too fas for
dat, sartainhim nuder sort of ting, take my say: den
me see a trange someting last nightme dream all 'bout de
debbil too, ony tink now; and he shook his head with a
lengthened, rueful, and ominous visage.
On the left of the ferry house, for about a quarter
of a mile, ran a rude and narrow path, or rather
track, winding around several precipitous ledges of
rock and hill, until it gained the open and
unfrequented
country; a few yards from the building it
overhung a thick and straggling copse, which sprang up
along the borders of the river below, to the full length of
the footway, while here and there was a small and sudden
opening with a descent to the water cut by the hand of
nature
through the tangled thicket; beyond this stretched
out a sandy and pebbly beach, over which, at nigh tide,
the hasty current made its march, and sullenly murmured
against the bank that stopped its farther progress; still in
some places beyond the ascent, lay scanty patches of dry
ground, covered and often defended from the stream
by splinters of the rocks and roots which had crumbled
or been washed down by the rains from the edges of the
earth and crags that projected above. Guided by this
difficult
and dangerous way, now trampling recklessly over
the sharp and flinty stones, now plashing in some
overflowing
of the current, whose waves tossed up their white
caps, moaning as in anger, like unblest spirits threatening
in their shrouds, with the carelessness of one who well
knew the rugged and broken track, in spite of stock or
hindrance
the horseman boldly rode, the clash of his horse's
feet following each other in a thick, close and
uninterrupted
succession, so that Yonne's words were scarce breathed
from his lip ere the subject of his forebodings appeared
beneath the brow of a lordly locust tree, which was fast
enveloping itself in a cloak of fleece, for the snow hung
like leaves to its boughs, as it stood like a sentinel at the
head of one of those narrow descending ways. As soon
as the rider perceived the Dutchman and his attendant,
through the dense haze, he hailed them with a loud
halloo
of `what cheer ho!' and striking his heels lustily in
the sides of the strong and mettled steed that he was
mounted
on, he was borne by the sure footed animal in an
instant
to the place where they were.
At the period here written of, many varieties and
fantastic
fashions of garb prevailed in the province,
probably
owing to the combining circumstances of the time
9*
for then raged in the old world disaffection, troubles and
persecutionin government, religious and personal
controversies
;
and the eyes of the anarchist, as well as the
felon, the vagabond, and the bankrupted swindler whose
ways of living were overstocked, undone or ruined at
home, turned naturally and wistful of trial, towards a land
so new, so remote, and as yet scarce operated onso
that numbers of wretches, vile and base, flying from
merited
punishment, and inflamed with wondrous hardihood
and the spirit of adventure, sought in the new world fresh
fields for daring and the exercise of their talents; and from
the accession of these emigrants the inhabitants
generally
,
for the bad will soon contaminate the good, were
composed of a motley medley of rogues and knaves: and
as it is wisely though homely remarked, that what is bred
in the bone will follow the fleshso it hath proved that
though the community in modern days may be better than
it hath been, it hath only improved in ingenuity in
committing
many more atrocities with impunityfor indeed
such numbers of bad men, the outcast scum, the
loathsome
purgings of European enormities, have ever since
been flowing in upon us, that every shadow of virtue that
might have once been, hath totally disappeared: and as
it is the interest of those who are ill of heart, to put
honesty
and honour out of countenance and favourthey
have, by the repeated attacks, overcome all who were
hardy enough to oppose, and made at last every thing so
subservient to their wills, that for characters who bear in
conduct affinity to them, there is not a country on the
bosom of creation more favourablehence there is no
marvel that daily and hourly their host is augmented with
recruits from the oldest adepts in villanyso that our whole
community is reduced to one common mass of worn out
pimps, sharpers, gamblers, and broken spendthrifts. As is
natural, the innovation of strangers brought with it, as well
as fresh crimes, new manners and customs; which as
novelty
,
however absurd, is most greedily followed, were soon
either grafted on or entirely superseded the old; and to
this day the vulgar rage of imitation hath flourished to
the ruin of many of its worshippers. Rich and poor, high
and low, are crazed with the folly of dress;no matter
how it befits their situations in societywhether it strains
their slender meansor is ridiculous from their
contemptible
birth and education:here the wife of a hod
carrier
is beprankt in loads of lace and finery that hath eaten
up in the purchase all that her labouring husband hath
been able to obtain for months by the severest industry
and probably whilst she is showing out her awkward airs
and decorations, her offspring are lacking sustenance in
some damp and filthy cellar or garret:there the
daughters
of some cheating usurious skinflint, who hath piled
up his fortune by the lowest means, and who, uplifted
above the condition to which he was born, the stable,
the cow yard, or the bake-house, hath suddenly swelled
into consequenceape the splendour and the ways of
their betters; and unmindful of their origin and forgetful of
the times when the plainest garb was a rarity, they launch
forth into extravagance:one broad shouldered, coarse
bouncing wench, who was certainly intended by nature for
a scrub, hath her waist drawn to the compass of an
hour-glass
,
and her robe so loaded with trimmings, that strong
as she appears she hath much ado to carry itanother,
rouged to the very eyes, brawny as a scullion, hath her
covering so light and delicate that the wind almost carries
it away:this lady cannot stir abroad but she must have
her glasses on, to show the world how learned and
studious
she isbut it is only abroad she wears them:and
lastly, the more strange that lady dresses, if it be but
costly and differing from common people, the more she
believes herself admired: and what to day excites the
laughter of all, to-morrow is sought after with avidity
and the greater price set on the thing, however mean its
intrinsic worth, the more valuable in the eyes of the
world. Indeed with us it is only considered that high,
luxurious, and magnificent living, together with fine and
costly clothesno matter whether they are in character
or notwhether afforded within the means of the wearer
or ever paid forare wanted to make the lady or the
gentleman.
But the stranger must not be forgot, the singularity of
whose attire from these remarks will not surprise the
reader. He was a slight built man, though formed with
that knit of shape and texture of limb that at once
bespoke
uncommon strength and activity. He was about
the middle age of life; though a naturally sallow, swarthy
and somewhat livid cast of complexion, which had
evidently
attained its height from the dusky tinges of a
southern sunsuch as his whole appearance told he had
lately been toiling undertogether with the half grey
hairs that scantily mixed in his long, black and untrimmed
locksmight possibly to the eye have added several
years: yet his every look was of that wild and desperate
nature, and there was about him so much of the quick
glance and dauntless daring of one who cared or feared
not, that the mind was forcibly stricken that he was a
man rather to be shunned than encountered. In his
apparel
there was but little that could elucidate that course
of life the wearer followed, for it was a strange mixture
of mendicant garment, applicable to the sea and land;
still it was not difficult to perceive that whatever might
be his calling, that of arms formed a part. His jerkin
was of Spanish cloth, whose delicate woof, intended for a
milder clime, could have guarded the rider but ill from
the stingings of the piercing blastbut this he recked
not;loose trunk hosen, such as were in use by the
mariners
of the era, slashed with silk, were gathered with
party hued ribbons at the kneethough all was much
rent, faded and discoloured, as by long and constant wear,
such as would be from the straits and passes of one who
voyaged the ocean, and had assumed some portions of
his attire from the strange places he had visited: a large
belt or bandeliere thrown over the right shoulder hung
down under his left arm, and sustained an arquebuss or
hand gun, which was carefully shielded from the wet and
night, by being wrapt in a folding of a huge sea cloak
that fell negligently from the neck, floating down on one
side of the horseman, and as it was thrown back
by the wind, disclosed in his baldric the glittering barrels
of a pair of pistolets and the naked blade of a hanger
while a stout leathern cap, or rather a sombrero, ribbed
with curves of iron, such as was worn by those on board
of armed vessels who were selected for boarding,
completed
his equipments.
Ho, how goes it old broad stern, said the stranger
as flinging himself to the ground, which rang with his
heavy tread, he rudely greeted the ferry master: while
the ample and gallant chest of the brave animal that had
borne him dripped with foam, which the speed that he had
been driven covered him with; how has the wind set in
your canvass since last we swung in a hammock together?

as when pursuing our way in a great hurry, on

some teazing, dunning, beggarly, dirty looking fellow,
who has the impudence to claim an acquaintance, and
from whose disgraceful companionship and button
holding
familiarities and importunity there is no escaping.
Feelings not entirely different from one in that sad
predicament
appeared at the view and salute of the horseman
to actuate the motions of Vanderspeigl, for first with a
sheepish gaze he looked up, then downthen on one side
and then on another, as though anxious to shun the
stranger's
eye; who perceiving the Nederlander's
embarrassment
,
and irritated at receiving no answer to his address
after a short interval abruptly continued in a rough voice.

Having become sensible to the backwardness of his
conduct, Sporus sought to obtain a transient mastery
over his actions, and while the cross and sour aspect of
his visage in spite of himself belied his words of welcome,
he thrust out with no cordial haste his huge hand.

finding

of the buccaneer, for such the stranger was, though
endeavouring
to assume an ease that scarce became him,

Ever since the mariner's arrival the darkness had been
increasing, and now the whole face of the heavens had
become
of one black hue, like a mighty funeral pallthe wet
sleet drove violently and swiftly about at every breathing
of the windstrong and irregular blasts of which, loaded
with the drift, at times swept wildly and madly along,
involving
every thing around in obscurity. The freebooter
wrapt him in his broad cloak, and sought to conceal
himself
within its ample folds from the anger of the storm;
while the hardy Dutchman also began to feel concern
from the increased severity of the atmosphere; for
actively
rubbing his hands together, he thrust them in the
comfortable warmth of his wide breeches pocket, whose
mouths yawned to receive them like the jaws of some
monstrous abyss;and then drawing with all his might
two or three hearty puffs from his pipe, as if thereby to
obtain confidence, he resumed the conversation.

had been betrayed, for though he was willing to refresh his
own clay, he did not relish giving a drop of comfort to his
unwelcome visitor; so he collected his courage, desirous
to know at once the worstvat in der vorld Eumet

Humph! ejaculated the rover drily, at the same
time casting an expressive glance on Yonne, who ever
since the pirate's first arrival had remained in one unaltered
attitude of fixed attention and wonder at every word that
passed, with eyes distended till they looked like teacups,
and glistening with the anxious curiosity that pervaded
his whole frame, while his ears drank in every sound that
escaped the lips of the speakers.

Yonne, however, having obtained what appeared a
sufficient distance for present safety, heedless of his
assurance
of instant departure, stirred not farther, but
seemed
rather inclined to return to the spot whereon he stood
ere his retreatfor in spite of the savage visage of the
sea robber, and although he fearfully stole a glance at
the arquebuss, which his obstinacy rendered so likely to
descend upon his head in angerhe still hesitated not,
urged by uncontrollable curiosity, to linger, for as yet he
had not comprehended the character of the pirate; and
a desire to know what a person of such strange dress and
language could have to say privately to his owner,
awakened
every dormant faculty within him. Besides, in the
dumb companion of the stranger he recognised an old
acquaintance
,
for whose being in such servitude and condition
he could no wise accountall this combined gave him an
uncommon share of stubborn courage; and depending on
his usual alertness in case of want, should the threatened
menace be attempted to be put in execution, he bravely
dared the consequence of his remaining. It is true, that
bravery is a faculty easily assumed, and mostly displayed
while distant from danger; and the credit of its possession
is often granted to some noisy sputterer, the haunter of
taverns and the bully of bawds, who, swelling with conceit,
and mighty in some nominal distinction which he hath
himself
taken without cause, and which courtesy merely allows
him, or that he may have by chance obtained by hard
service
as a veteran, by marching and countermarching a
ragged train of levies through lane and street under a
destructive
and heavy fire from that enemy of citizen
soldiers
,
a raging sun; (whose power affords him an
opportunity
of boasting of the severity of his discipline, though
in reality he may have a mortal antipathy `to that
villanous
saltpetre that is dug from out the bowels of the
earth;' and loveth no kind of smoke except the smoke
of his segar; for that bears resemblance to his own
bravery
being
a great deal of smoke to a little fire, and
is alone kept alive by repeated puffings;)yet fear, the
very reverse of courage, hath oftentimes called it forth:
many cowards, driven to desperation, have acted like
brave mendastards in their whole lives, have, when
thrust forth by fear, proved victors in deadly combats.
It is likely from these known and certain principles, and
perhaps urged by the hope of becoming heroes from
some lucky accident, that there are among us so many
bitten with the mania of being chieftains without scarcely
knowing the lock from the bore of a fuseethough
doubtless
it is neither necessary for a general to have either
brains or boldness; for in truth he from whom I draw my
example and supposition, hath neither; as indeed the only
mystery he may comprehend is the making of his own
beaver, which from so competent a judge, ought to be of
the best; however, it is equally certain that the
composition
of that which the beaver covers, is too much mixed
with the commonest wool to give its wearer any assistance
at a critical moment:nevertheless, the rashness of the
prying negro was not derived from any of the causes just
detailed, but solely from that which it was first explained
had actuated himunconquerable curiosity.
Curse him tam imperancehim tirty mannersony

burst from the lips of the provoked Yonne at the
uncivil attack of the freebooter, him no wort mush, me
see dat clebber 'noughgood as him any day, me like
him look like a tief sartain, wid all him talk, and then
turning up a nose whose nostrils naturally covered one
half of his wide face, he gazed at his persecutor with one
of those contemptuous glances that denoted his sense of
the unmannerly breeding of his enemy, and an amazing
confidence in his own superiority of gentility and
education
.
However Yonne's continued loitering succeeded
in irritating one of whom he stood in greater awefor
Vanderspeigl being probably likewise unwilling that a
third person, and particularly one of so communicative a
nature as the black, should be a partaker of the
freebooters
words, at last exerted his authority.

There was wanted no repetition of this threat, for the
negro spoke aloud not a word more, but quick as the

shrunk precipitately in the door way and in a moment
disappeared.

rage of the mariner, and sinking his short pursy form into
a heap beneath the powerful gripe with which it was
assailed
,

Not so hasty, lubber, I've brought all things, even to
the purser's quill, said Eumet producing them, here

The Nederlander, while his determined tormentor
stood watching over him, with the muzzle of the piece
on a level with his head, though scarce alive with terror,
or conscious what he was about, complied quickly with
the marauder's demand, and signed the draft handed him;
which he had no sooner finished, than the other eagerly
snatched it from him; and having carefully folded it, he
placed it securely in his jerkin: while Vanderspeigl by this
motion being relieved from the present threatened and
imminent danger, turned his eyes towards his garment
where it had been held by Eumetthe place of whose
grasp was plainly visible, from sundry rents and lacerated
marks of violence.

replaced his arquebuss in the support of the bandalier.

yarn, we must have her papers or our jig's up; for thof

bring us off, it is hard to treat with the conqueror after
the flag's down: now ere I steered here, a canoe rowed
for the creek in which was the king's messenger; the
galliot herself, I take it, is fearful of venturing without a
pilot down the river; so hark ye, rogue, the captain leaves
much to thy ingenuity; they will perforce seek your
guidance,and then, whispered the desperado, you

buccaneer, turning suddenly round from the horse which
he was preparing to remount, and interrupting the Dutch

his courage momently escaping him as he
expostulated

dashed up the drift and sand that encircled his hoofs;

And striking his heels sturdily in the flanks of the
horse, the gallant animal sprung like an arrow through
the nightand darting down the long track by which
he had advanced, in a few minutes both steed and rider
were lost to the view.
Der tam birateder tieving hond, growled out the
ferry-masterthe long pent up flood of gall bursting forth
with all the virulence of an angry stream breaking its
dam; ja, hesh sdole dat bay paard, mit de vite sbot all over

The Dutchman having thus sorrowfully expressed
himself
,
paused and listened a short period, with an
elongated
and melancholious visage, to the hollow, sullen and
retiring echoes of the horse's tread, muttering indistinct
curses between his teeth, and giving over the buccaneer,
without remorse or reservation, to the devil. Being
somewhat satisfied with this severe revengeand all the
oaths applicable, furnished by his fertile imagination
being
exhausted, he surlily shrugged his shoulders and
turned to retire, when right in his path he perceived an
abused companion;the fragments of his pipe were
scattered
before him; it had dropt unfortunately, during
one of his partial stresses from the embracing lips of its
owner, and had met a destructive reception from the
frozen earth whereon it had fallen.
Got tam! myn byp is broke, he lugubriously
groaned

As he grumbled these expressive words in woeful
spirit, he seized with a hand at each corner, the
colopeye
of his huge `broeks'which either from the
agitation
,
or the uncommon exertions he had been forced to
undergo, were fast escaping by gentle slips from the
situation they were used and intended to occupy: (for in
those times, the waistband was the only supporter;) and
giving them a fretful hitch, that brought all back to its
dutyhe, (the puissant Mienheer Sporus Vanderspeigl,
slow and thoughtful, bearing a countenance whose
expression was that of vinegar itself, while wending

And so worthy and patient reader, he having thus
taken it in mind to depart, I shall with his disappearance,
make an end of this first book; not however, without
inviting you, if your stomach holds good, and your
appetite

BOOK THE SECOND.
THE TRAVELLER'S ADVENTURE.
SECTION I.
Why this history o' thine is but a lie
Fit for a charlatana disjointed thing
Born by fits and startshaving no symmetry:
A worn out cloak, filled with motely patches:
A kind of labyrinth, where the thrider
Hath no sooner set forth, than he is brought
Disappointed back unto the entrance:
It hath more flourishes than a fiddler's
Prelude; more prosing than a sailor's narrative:
And as many new beginnings, as a
Repentant sinner's lifewho no sooner
Gets fairly through with one peccadillo,
Than he slips as it were by mere habit,
In another; yet roundly swears that each
Shall be the last.
A RIGHT WOMAN
.
The potent wand of the storied necromancer of
Arabia
,
hath dwindled to the feebled rush that bows before
the blast, in comparison to the enchanter pen, whose
touch portrays the boundless fictions of modern romance:
the tameless spirits of the elements, earth, air, fire, and
the living waters, ever wait its magic calls; are ever
obedient to the wizard's command; while alone of all
created things(guided by imagination, upborne on free
and soaring pinion,) the mind whose thoughts it sets upon
the page of man, ranges uncontrolled as a creature of
sthe air itself, the unlimited space of time, ransacking
the almost forgotten stores and buried ashes of the long
departedsearching and renovating to its own purpose
and use the chronicles, records, and rude and mouldering
pages of legendary lore, of ages past; bidding, as did in
ancient
day, the wise and holy cabalist, by a word, the
scattered and dust dissolved flesh, to revisit the dry and
carious bones of death, with life, and vigour, and
freshness
,
as in the hour of their breathing actions, when
animation
dwelt within them; commanding the wanton and
fickle winds to give back the wild and wandering rumours
they once swelled with, and tell of mighty tales of hard
fought contests; of triumphs, of wars, and raging storms;
of leprous plagues and foul diseaseswhich, since spent,
that merely the memory thereof was known, had in
their angered and deadly passage, depopulated, spoiled
and laid waste to deserts, wide regions; making the
grass to grow within the city's streets, and turning the
fair face of health, of beauty and of youth, to the livid
and pallid colour, that loves to creep with fading hue
upon the hot cheek of yellow sickness, eating away the
roseate tint of loveliness, and struggling for its banquet
with life itself:yea! filling the now earth-choked and
unregarded sepulchres, with all the then brave, rich and
great. At once, even in the flight of a vision, hath it
called the proud citythat of all its relics of ancient
splendourits marble palacesits bright and glittering
spiresits haughty temples, lofty and carved colonnades
and frowning citadels, whose names of glory time hath
scarce preserved, to rise like the summer's sun, redolent
in magnificence; its busy crowds and thronged marts
awakening to the sight: nay, moreunbridled fancy hath
dived down in the ocean's womb, and with curious eye
gazed in its chrystal and untrodden caveswhere, hid
from human search, are heaped treasures that would make
the heart of prodigality run over with desire, and craze
the miser with coveting; where alike, with the
bleached
and cadaverous remains of the sea whelmed mariner,
and the green webbed nest of the water snake, sleep in
obscurity, the dusky amethyst, the lily coloured pearl,

whole beds of coralthe yellow bars of gold, washed
by the waves for ages, even to sandthe vast wrecks of
the richest argosies, that ever swam on the bosom of the
dark blue deepall, all come and appear at the
sorcerer's
beck, changing and flitting like shadows in some
brilliant dream of midnight, which as music listened to
in youth's spring tide, dwells long upon the memory
though the notes are hushed in silence.
From the premises set down, understand not reader,
(be you gentle or simple) that it is meant that all the
tribe of quill-drivers are thus gifted; for it requires but
a small share of observation or study, to perceive the
vanity of the multitude; for where there flourishes one
individual endowed with the necessary qualities, there
are a thousand scrawlers, besotted with ambition and
ignorance, and the desire of imitating; who spring up
weed-like, sucking the wholesome juices and poisoning
the fatness of the fresh and fruitful soil, as tares in a
wheat field: for in all man strives to copy man: he is a
mere creature of imitation, not less than the animals of
the forest: the ass, though stupid and insignificant, with
clumsy hoof attempts the proud tramp of the gallant
charger: the ape mimics with antic and fantastic capers,
the noblest actions of humanity: and even so will
coarse conceit, and impudent and selfish consequence
thrust themselves in the path of aspiring and eagle
flighted talent: but what is more to be lamented, by
the aid of their very assurance, they are too often for
a time enabled to mislead and deceive, obtaining a
momentary
and shameful applause: for indeed false merit is many
times taken for the true; because while the one sinking
beneath its own diffedence, scarcely dares show itself, the
other with loud and insolent boastings, is constantly
pushing
forward: and while the first is surrounded with
starveling myrmidons and prostitute flatterers, who are
forced for their own subsistence to keep it in credit, the
last is unassisted, unadorned, and hath nothing beyond its
own virtue to recommend it. And further, prejudice will
go great lengths; and when that infirmity hath taken
sway, the weakest drivellers, even by persons of
excellent
mind, are commended; while the brightest parts
appear intolerable organs of nonsense or stupidity.
Indeed
it is to be remarked, whether it can be owing to
that blindness which policy or passion casts on the
understanding
,
or the careful prudence of faction, is difficult
to determine, that even the many shallow, empty-brained
dependants of a party, who undertake by noise and
impudence
,
calumny and gross railing, vile lying and scurrility,
to advance their cause, are considered in the light of
sensible
and witty writers: yet these evils have their remedy
in timeas the strict examination which it calls forth,
withers
undeserved laurelsfor not even the strong barriers
that wealth may build, are able to oppose its sure and steady
march: nevertheless the crowd is ever imposed onfor
it seems as if universally, the reason and judgment of
mankind; (if indeed the multitude have those faculties,)
are sunk in inertness and indolence: so much so, that where
there is naturally a strength of thought, and a vigour of
reflection, the nature of the beast (the term must be
permitted) strives against allowing itself scope even
when demanded in action by an incident of uncommon
moment. Assuredly people in general take too little
trouble
to think for themselves; they are ready at any time
to receive an opinion formed and expressed by others,
even though its fallacy be apparent, and it hath gone the
regular routine of conversation when applied to the
subject
in question, a month past: and though it hath the foul
impression of its original birth, and bears the marks of
the narrow mindthe selfish viewthe particular and
actuating feeling: the hired and ignorant strain of the
first framer, it still has its effects; for the greatest liar,
has those who believe and place confidence in him; and
though the untruth which he hath coined lives but an
hour unexposed, it hath done its work; there are its
votaries
who will not be convinced of its error:How
seldom
is there met that man, who, totally divested of
malice, of littleness of mind, of private envy or public
enmity, will give to that which he reflects or speaks on,
a fair, candid and impartial representation: who will
take in the range of his argument and idea, the bright
and gloomy sides; giving them a like chance; neither
seeking to draw an unkind inference, nor disposed to
receive
aught which is not broadly shown; but holding
the affair as it should be viewed in truth, not giving his
sense to one side, until he has heard and understood the
other: while daily the mob is seen to be led on and
wielded by the busy tongue of some shallow-pated and noisy
egotist, whom principle and interest urge on to corrupt
the manners, blind the understanding, and destroy the
honesty, of all whom he can; and who frequently, by
the power of his own emptiness and self-sufficiency, (this
is from existing life) raises himself to be the very
sparrow-hawk
of the circle wherein he holds forth; gaining,
though despicable in reputation, by dint of loud words,
an empire over the supine, languid and careless spirit of
his listeners, who would not put themselves to a minute's
labour from the laziness of their natures, to refute the
hollowness of his doctrines, or overturn the flimsy
foundation
which he argues on. Again it is to be observed,
that man is greatly a follower of habit; and were it not
for the uncommon stupidity of some, even in the earliest
childhood, one might incline to the opinion that supposes
providence hath not granted one of his creatures, more
by nature, than another; but that it is the custom, the
accidental taste, the treatment, and a thousand directing
circumstances of infancy, that points the course taken,
and the faculties shown, in after manhood: for many, who
would have made the world wonder as writers or
statesmen
,
have climbed the trembling mast, and toiled on the
weltering deck: many who would as warriors have
conquered
,
sleep unknown beneath the osiers of a rustic tomb;
and many who would by the fire of eloquence have roused
a nation, have laboured for a single crust to sate life's
cravings
,
in the most menial officeand so it is ordered, for
the sake of that inequality which constitutes society:
yet from this, there is reason to believe, that could the
true roads be pointed out in youth, that few could boast
of a superiority to their fellow sojourners of mortality:
but as it has just been stated, it may be custom, habit,
from being cribbed and bound in servile dependence on
one another, in the state termed civilization; that is
owing that want of strength, that womanish weakness of
mind, that dares not, when convinced, contend against the
incorrect voice, that nearly always guides the popular
feeling; though when that very feeling hath subsided,
or met with some bar that hath sent it back with the
force of a mighty whirlwind, to the right way: for
popular
feelings, are as the clouds of sand driven by the
desert sirocever shifting, ever assuming new forms and
shapes; there are many, (after it hath become notorious
how widely mistaken they have been,) who quick enough
take undeserved praise for judicious foresight, justice of
reflection, and predictions of the event as it had
happened
;
while it wants but small stretch of remembrance,
that these had been loudest in the wrong: and thus it is
if one begins the cry, all follow in the wake, yelping and
open-mouthed, even as the pack, the leading hound;
though it is extremely probable, the loudest noise-maker,
and the most hollow throated knave, hath the worst
reason
for his conduct: this, and no more, are the wheels
that bear the movements of party rage and political
factions
:
for who is it that is exalted on the shoulders of
the mobwho holds the helm of governmentat least
popular ones? Is it the wise, the honest, or the
deserving
of the nation? No! the people are darkly led on,
plunged in night; they are deceived in all things; their
name is only used for their destruction; an engine to
further the views of intriguing and designing rascals:
they believe themselves all powerfulbut they are
mockedthey are driven unknown to themselvesthey
are ruled as by rods of ironthey are misled by artful
stratagemsand what is worse, many times they rush
wittingly into bondage, and grasp their chains, with eager
hands and open eyes: for who are at their headwho
are their spokesmentheir dependance? a miserable,
beggarly set of half-starved blockheads: ruined at once
in fortune and reputation, whom the convulsions of the
day, and their own insolence, have drawn out of
obscurity
who
unable to earn their bread by industrious and
honorable means, fly to a trade, which, such is the
depravity
11*
of the time, its, followers may be known and
drawn in one single sentence: if he is a politician, he is
an office seeker; if he is an office seeker, he is little
better than a scoundrel, a sycophant, a hypocrite, and a
lying rogue: and is this not proved? go, doubter, and
ask who write for the public journals; who bustle in
the world; who brawl at city meetings; who cry at the
corners on an election; half-starved physicians, who lack
practice from their ignorance; swindling, client-skinning,
pettifoggers, retailers of the law, whose wit at knavery,
hath run too dry to get a livelihood; bankrupted traders,
and drunken, ruined mechanics: all an outcast,
outlawed
,
desperate set!undeniably, such are the great leaders
of our political struggles; all caring not one jot what
becomes of the people, their liberty, or their rights, so
they themselves are taken care of; and to accomplish
this, they overthrow without remorse, every obstacle:
they adjust, to further their pernicious and selfish views,
the principles and the constitution of the government;
having their hearts set on how to get or to keep their
places: they mingle and sow discord among all; changing
nature itselfsetting brother against brotherneighbour
against neighbourso that no man is either a citizen or
friendhowever great his honour, patriotism and
religion
,
unless he be of the same side.And again, who are
they? What a throng of despicable villains present
themselves in answer to the question: behold yon
sycophantic
lawyerfilled with mean, low cunning, gained
from the rabble and dregs of society, with whom his
business
lies, and from whence he hath sprung: glutted
with stripping thieves of their plunder, and robbing the
burglar of his booty, that it may serve his debaucheries
a licensed highwayman of the barwinked at in his
rogueries, when he should be sent to the same bourne
with those whom he defends, and whom his ignorance or his
cupidity, often condemnssee him changing from side to
side, as each party prevails, as often as the shifting
current
of the waves: shallow and brainless, he roars aloud
but the brain and heart that guides it, is as empty of
honour, faith, and all that good men delight in, as the
sound that forms the words he uttersout on it! out on
it! the purchase and the price of such a man is in the
hands of all. And yet he is surpassed by his comate
fit friend for such a being(fiends make compacts)a
real descendant of old Macklin's herowho, had he lived
in the days of that stern satirist, would have given the
ancient fresh hints for his Scotchman, of consummate
villany, that he never, with all his misanthropy, could
have believed man capable of conceiving or
acting
:
a civilianjust possessed of talent enough, to make
his roguery more atrocious: a politicianbut of that
corrupt
class, that he would embrace an opportunity of
committing the blackest wickedness, to keep or obtain an
employmentand is ever, at a moment's warning, ready
to throw off his allegiance, and turn from the party, whom
from interest he has espoused: just such a character one
would have to set, were he going to draw the portraiture
of a man, who, placed in an undeserved public office,
would turn the power derived therefrom, to his own
private
use: who devoid of every sense of honour,
humanity
or honesty, and swayed by the blackest demon of
revenge, would meanly persecute and crush the
unfortunate
:
a man indeed, who was he placed in the
situation
,
would act, if his temper be rightly judged, like the
notorious Finch, the solicitor general of James the First,
who, while public prosecutor against Lord Delamere,
forgot
the manners of a gentleman, and breaking down the
virtuous barrier of disinterestedness, which should have
actuated him, became the corrupt and violent partisan
and declaimer: but the province hath a precedent of
character nearerfor when that Bayard, of whom
farther
on this narrative makes mention, was accused of
treason and sedition, Weaver, the king's attorney,
hearing
the jury was loth to bring in a bill, is said to have
shown his heart by crying out, that if they found not
an indictment, he would have them trouncedand that
though Bayard's neck was gold, he would hang him.
Thus would this man act, was chance to place him in
such a station; for instead of the first to quell, he is the
first to lead the riotous and disaffected, even though he
should commit the greatest crimes; but he is one that would
not stickle at a triflefor a moment's spite; he would
without shame, nay, glory in it as an honourable deed,
defile the house of God: the name of sacrilege, from
youth hath been familiar with him; he is the leader and
the spokesman of every noisy blackguard; instead of
obeying the laws he breaks them, and winks at the crimes
and enormities of his friends and partisans; he would
make a partnership of knavery with the released forger,
and cover, as the parent bird its unfledged young, the
atrocious enormities of his companions:but it is
disgusting
to dwell longer on this contemptible subjectyet
there is an Italian proverb, that tells us there is a gallows
for every rascal.
Hic multa desiderantur
.
From all this, a conclusion may be formed, that human
laws will ever be defective, and that knaves will always
find out some invention to elude their force; for their
wits being ever industrious, it rarely happens that honest
men are able to guard against them.
But what hath all these wise dissertations, these
tedious episodes, and these round about flighty
wanderings
,
to do with the progress of the story, inquireth the
worn out reader of the composer: you are wrong,
master authorpositively wrong.these are not times
for wholesome satire: and between us, if you bend
your bow, your shaft will be blunted on hard rocks
for folks now-a-days, care very little about being told
their faultsso it is in vain you cry down vileness and
ignorance
as
not only brass, but lead, is above par value
in the market, saith the stock jobber, or rather the
honourable
member of a certain honourable board
[42]
[42]
This sentence of the colloquium between the auctor et lector,
puzzleth me exceedingly; seeing that, I believe, the words of the
text have an allusion to some matter or thing, whereof there is
now no trace or authority: howbeit, in the elder day, the epithet
`
honourable
,' was of great signification, and choicely and sparingly
used: moreover, few men had attained its application: albeit, the
matter is reversed in these times, and every blackguard putteth in
his title thereto; so that could the text be applied to men of this
era, or any institution whereof the foundation had been laid within
late date, I should fain construe it as an ironical designation for
some community of sharpers, black-legs and rogues, who like a
band of thieves, had joined together, the easier to plunder the
unwary
,
who divineth not their mysteries.T. P.
for
both these commodities are greatly dealt in, especially
by editorsand imported by the wholesale from
Connecticut
,
New Hampshire, and the other New England
States. Though if you intend to cry down the vices of
the time, heaven forefend you die not ere the
enumeration
be finished: therefore friend, take this advice
trouble your head no more with other people's doings,
but look to your ownand without more ado, travel on
with this matter between us, of which I am already in
despair of understandingfor I begin to lose the
connexion
of the plot and every thing else: but before you
set out in earnest, let me tell you, if you wish to make
the thing palatable, after trying my patience as you have
done, spice your story well with murder, madness and
loveor rest assured it won't do.
Well on my word, I believe you are right, and I'll
strive to complybut I am of such a singular and
digressive
nature(for I am writing perfectly at ease,
determined
to inhale every fragrant flower that I meet;)
that it will be a severe trial for me to restrain my
humour
,
nevertheless I must confess, that although I
respect
what you have said, being at leisure and not
caring, as long as you accompany me without downright
grumbling, how far I am from my journey's endI
cannot
help but think it will be pleasant, when the road is
particularly dusty, that we make a short excursion in
the fieldsthough it will be a sufficient hint for me,
when you get tired, that you yawn, or turn over the
pages with a slight glance. Yet as to your concluding
sentence, I can only assent in part: for it is now the
fashion among all great writers, to forget the plot, or put
it on the last pagebeing the most inferior ingredient
of the composition: however, the proem above indited,
like the unmeaning and hackneyed sentiments of an
argumentative
discourse in Congress, which gives you more
trouble to understand than read, will serve to amuse and
keep you in playwhile at a gentle pace, I transport
myself across the threshold of the puissant Mynheer
Vanderspeigl's domicile: the door of which, just
opened
,
I have some time been holding, for the purpose of
describing somewhat of the interior; whither, if you
have no objection thereto, we will enter before the
magnanimous
ownerwho in the present instance moved
heavily; weighty with dubitation, and feeling in nearly
as
sharp
a disposition, as a certain modern orator and
statesman, who having carried his speech in his pocket
to a political meetingnevertheless on rising to give
vent to his eloquence, and astonish the natives, found at
a pause, that unfortunately, he had dropped the
manuscript
,
which was to prompt him by the wayand so
after thrice in vain attempting to proceed, he sat down
as he roseeven as that wondrous henwho cackled and
cackled, and cackled, about the barn yard for three
winters
,
but never laid an egg.
The huge log blazed cheerfully on the broad hearth,
and sent up the wide and cavernous mouth of the
chimney
,
rolling clouds of smoke, while basking in the
grateful
warmth, with that love of heat which characterizes
the African, as close as it was possible to creep in the
fire-place, was stationed our old acquaintance, Yonne.
His legs resembled, when drawn together at the ancle,
an octagon windowor rather, if a digressive simile may
be allowed, his were such a couple of shanks as would
elicit the unbounded admiration of a horse-jockey, and
would gain for him from a person of that respectable
calling the appellation of a well set man; for the shin
bones ran in that perfect and graceful curve, which, if
their proprietor was mounted on a racer, would have
secured his safety, as though they were a pair of braces
made to the shape of the steed's body: now these legs,
which were an ample illustration of the saw, that there
cannot be too much of a good thingfor they were of
a wonderful even thickness from the knee downwards
were cased in two redoubtable cast off jack boots of the
Mynheer's; but in whose wearing, the utmost attention
had been bestowed on economy; for long before, they
had been given on a pauwse holy-day, by the generous
Vanderspeigl, to his slave: the sole of one foot, had
been completely worn out to a sieve; while but little
more praise could be given to the other, for fellows,
without a violation of description, they could not be
called: and as the Dutchman, in his personal affairs, always
practised, and manfully stuck to the maxim, that a thing
should not be thrown away, if any use whatever could
be derived from it: so that although one of the pair might,
by misfortune or accident incidental to protracted usage,
be rendered unfit for further service, he was wont to
take care of that which remained, as in case of
unfavourable
weather, he might preserve his best boots,
which had cost him ten stuyversfor they were of the
first cut of Tony Von Slyck, the shoenmaker of Nieuw
Amsterdam: still this which was about to be described,
was perfect, except the heel and one side having given
waybeing to the disgrace of the thread with which it
was workedburst in a monstrous gapso that from
these unavoidable occurrences, while Yonne's toes in a
state of admirable nudity and cleanliness, as if in
defiance
of frost and cold, and as wearied of confinement,
paraded in respectful obedience from the point of the
one boot; his other foot, either from a knowledge of the
cool reception it was likely to meet, or from being
unable
to force its way from a narrowness in the passage,
(which was unconquered by coaxing or grease,) scarcely
made its way half down the upper leather, as the
cobler
designates it: yet necessity being the mother of
invention
,
here supplied her partfor the heel, by
constant
residence there having formed its bed, the remainder
unattended to and entirely neglected, hung useless and
unoccupied
on one side: however, this superfluous
ornament
,
like a dirty, noisy vagabond who has nothing to
do in the world but make a great clamour, that people
may suppose him a person of magnitude and business,
kept up such a constant, everlasting, never failing
clatter
,
that when the negro was in motion, he seemed as if
he had a dozen tin kettles and pewter pans adjoined to
him. After this specimen of frugality, it will not be
improper
to remark, that in general this excellent virtue
has disappearedor at least there are but solitary
instances
of its practice; not but what meanness is in
perfection
,
but it is of that sort which prompts a man to go to
every length, and pursue every low method to entrap
and cheat another: but with themselves, they
believe
all depends on show; that their character consists
in their appearance; and that he whose coat has lost a
button and is worn to the threads, is no better than a
rogue; but he who runs up a bill at a fashionable
tailor's
,
is of the first standing. And further, it is the aim
of all to appear beyond their spherethis man, not
worth in the world a farthing, must have his furniture of
the first kindso he takes every way to deceive and get
creditfills his house and then breaks: this lady is
bitten
with a fever to buy all that is sold at auction, of the
latest and newestshe crowds her rooms with
costly
and unnecessary articles, but for which her family
has no use; her tables must be of rose-wood,
exquisitely
carved and gildedall for show, though not
for wear: if the fashion of last year is offered her for
comparatively one third of its worth, she will turn up
her nose as scornful as a queensooth, what is she to
do with such trash? indeed she would not give it
house-room
,
though it might do well enough for some who
were of the lower ordernevertheless it is not
improbable
,
could this fine lady think so far back, that an age
had not passed since she was fortunate in having a deal
board to set toand was happy instead of feeding off
of China, to take her meals from the coarsest earthen
ware.But to the black, who at the present instance, being
seated in comfort, had both of his crooked yet sturdy
supporters, resting against a huge mound of ashes, that
had been collected and heaped up by that tidy
housewife
,
dame Vanderspeigl, with the most extraordinary
nicetynot a grain protruding on the bright surface of
the pavement of Holland brick, which shone in a gay
coat of Dutch pink, tastefully polished with molasses. As
most of the ornaments of the worthy negro's person have
undergone a description, it would be unbecoming, and
really not doing him justice, to neglect a mention of those
useful limbs his hands, especially bearing in view that
which they were engaged at; natheless, they were as
delicate as might be expected, although of the real
shoulder
of mutton make, and were, when spread, not
unlike
an Indian pancake, presenting to the sight of the
curious
,
two high prized and deep tinted hues, the outside
being of the most durable and stable black, while the palm
was a mixed copper and dingy red-in truth they were an
exceeding
proper explanation of that new order of
architecture
,
the very offspring of modern taste, science, and
refinement
,
that in the same edifice allows that extraordinary
diversity, a front of white marble and a rear of brown
stone; amply proving that the ancients knew nothing
about building, with all their pretensionstheir vaunted
chastity and simple grandeur of effect; for what were these
to the divine conceptions of a Corporation committee?
What, though jesters may liken the structure in question
to a vestcoat pattern, still how infinitely obligated is
posterity to that wise head and erudite ingenuity, that
in so expensive an undertaking could make out to
save moneywho notices how much it wants in
breadth, or that it lacks any proportion, when their
admiring eyes gaze on that effigy which surmounts it;
that wooden representation of justice, that with hands
extended seems ready to grasp every thing within its
reach: (a just emblem of the deeds that under its name is
enacted, for he that can
best fill
its hands is surest of his
object)But the hands of Yonne are those that ought to
engage the attention, for the one was busily employed in
steadying, with the aid of his chin, the support of his huge
fiddle whose ravishing power entranced the soul of the
musical negro, and solaced his vexed spirit, which, as the
reader is aware, had been wrought on to irritation by the
incivility of the rover, so that his whole soul was dissolved
in harmony of his own making; while the fingers of his
Vol. I. 12
other hand gracefully drew the bow athwart the catgut,
in time to the contortions of both visage and body, for the
last at every proper period, as by way of assistance to
the melody, moved slowly backwards and forwards with
a see-saw action, like the pendulum of a clock; added to
this, with not an unharmonious throat, as has been hinted
was his custom, he poured forth in voice some catch, the
words of which hath not reached these times by tradition,
though the famous tunes of `Greenland dat's a barren
place,' and `Toraches the buttermilk's fat, Toraches,' are
of such antiquity that they might be ventured without an
anachronism to be inserted, but as this narrative is one on
which much may be relied as an assured relation, they
cannot be here stated as the ones which Yonne trolled.
Around him, as the reader might expect from a former
relation of this Orpheus' powers, enwrapt by interchange
of voice and instrument, crowded the whole issue of
Sporus
Vanderspeigl, a chubby-cheeked, open-mouthed troop
of little white-headed, sunburnt varlets, who at times at
the very top of their lungs, swelled the notes, or
sprawled
about the hearth half naked and filled with laughter;
to these delectable sounds it must not be omitted to detail,
were adjoined, as by way of variation, the snarling,
barking
,
howling, and snapping of the Dutchman's dog, a long,
hollow-backed, thin-gutted, shabby-coated, ill-natured
house cur, that tantalized, as it dozed before the fire, by
the restless feet and startling shouts of glee from the
joyous
children, seemed teased and goaded with venom and
crossness nearly to bursting:breaking into this riot of
sounds at intervals, came the quick, sharp, and piercing
voice of the goede vrouw herself, as she drew her hand
away from the swift turning spinning wheel, which by the
help of her active foot, was kept in constant motion, to
shake it threateningly as she stilled the different complaints
which, in spite of the prevailing good humour, were often
preferred to her, or as she soundly saluted the ears of
some little stiff-necked and obstinate delinquent or rebel
to her sovereign authority, with a hearty cuff that made
them tingle again, and which was returned by the
bare-legged
urchin with a fierce long screaming to the very
stretch of his throat. Of the dame, it is almost needless
to repeat, that about the Nederlander's precincts there
was not a living thing but what cowered trembling at her
slightest glance; few were more respected than the
matron
;
she ruled over her domain, all paying unlimited
obedience; did she command, a page flies not faster to a
monarch's orders than did her subjects; the very cats
ran affrighted to their couch in the oven when she spoke,
and the anxious eyed and watchful rat coiled himself close
in his nest in the cupboard, even the spider paused in fear
and wonder at its laborious work along the rafters, as it
listened to the echoes of her shrill tones. She was a tall,
spare, meagre looking woman, with pale sharp features
of the vinegar cast, all terribly pitted with the small pox,
and enlivened with a pair of tartar twinkling little grey
eyes, that, together with the puckered, pinched up mouth,
appeared as sour as they well could beshe wore a
chintz short gown covered with large red flowers, her
petticoats, (on the number of which she prided herself,)
were of a woollen stuff, interchangeably of blue, black,
orange, and white hue; the outer one being uncommon
short; from their edges, the various colours of the others
that were under displayed themselves to advantage like
the many dies of a rainbow; at each side of her hung a
pocket, which, in size and dimensions, might be compared
to moderate saddle bags, these were filled to the brim;
thick blue yarn stockings, with clocks, and sharp pointed,
broad bottomed, skate shaped shoes, with bright large
silver
buckles, covered her feet; on her head, she had a
little round, puritanical kloeckminshie, or night cap, close
crimped and stuck full of pins, needles, and other stray
articles of that kind, which the saving dame had gathered
from the floor in sweeping. The good woman was snugly
seated at her wheel in a high backed, low bottomed, and
leathern cushion chair, lustrous with wax and rubbing,
curiously carved, and studded with numerous brass nails;
and without doubt this chair was a magnificent thing
of its kind, and had been an heir loom in mevrouws
family time out of mind:and if her statement could
be depended on, and there is little cause to disbelieve
her, it was a proof of the antiquity of her race; for
she was one who had her whole genealogy by rote,
and whatever might be thought, there were few who
dared openly dispute her averments, that the
aforesaid
chair had belonged to her great aunt's fourth
cousin's great uncle's grandfather, who had been den
Hogen Mogendheid of Amsterdam in der Vaderlandand
on such dignity, his descendant greatly plumed herself, and
in consideration of which, it is currently reported, she
was wont to hold her nose at the smallest computation,
a foot higher than her husband, who, low-lived and
wicked fellow, cared not a grain for all the ancestors in
the worldand hard hearted wretch that he was, had
no pride of familyso much so, that it was generally
supposed he scarcely knew or troubled himself, whether
he had ever had a grandfather. It must be allowed that
in most cases, pride is a despicable feeling, but Vrouw
Vanderspeigl had much to say in her defence, for as
ornaments
to the elbows of this same enen zeetel, were
exquisitely
chiselled two little pursy, round bodied, Dutch
built cupids, with legs nearly as thick as their bodies, and
curled full bottomed periwigs, and short squabby wings
each holding to his mouth a pipe which might have
been meant for a trumpet, which the deities, by the
prodigious swellings of their cheeks, for they were blown
out like bladders, were straining to soundand indeed
when we hear of speeches on a walking stick, and the
value set on an old cocked hat, who can blame the
matron
if these wooden dignitaries were the joy of her
heart? they were in her mind superior to the finest
sculpture that could be producedthe whole gallery of
statuary might in vain have been offered for the tail of
the bob wig of one of the puissant gods: she even
affirmed
that the schout himself, had not a seat in his
council
that could be compared with the one in question
and which she positively asserted had been publicly
presented
by the Stadt itself, to the worthy, her ancestor
aforesaid, in reward for his being the greatest builder of
his day, and his being a burgomasterin which capacity
she boasted he was accustomed to outsit all his fellows
at a feasta virtue now in extreme vogue among
modern
echevins, who make it an invariable rule to remain
at table until they cannot stand. So having been induced,
by this veneration in which he was held, I have hunted
up with great research, the tradition and history of
Mynheer
Van Zwakborstig, as the worthy from whom Vrouw
Yokupminshie was a lineal branch, was calledby which
it appears, although nothing is known of his early life,
except that he pursued diligently the careful craft of a
timmerman or carpenter: yet in despite of the dame's
statement, he was first brought into notice in the city of
Nieuw Amsterdam, instead of the mother metropolis of
that nameas usual in the great town with others, it had
been with himthat the maxim used towards him, was
not `what he had been,' but `what he was'so the
Mynheer got respect on account of his pocket, not of
his mannersfor the latter, as may be imagined, were not
of the bestfor it is confidently asserted, that he was a
tough knot, and scarce could be planed: nevertheless
he made out to plane most others with whom he dealt
for he amassed considerable shavingsso that in a short
period after his first
debut
, he established himself in a
stylish and blooming prieel at Schabakanica,
[43]
[43]
This was the name by which the place, where the village of
Greenwich now stands, was anciently known.
but the
more wealthy he grew, like most men so situated, the
greater this rural character felt his consequence; and
although Hopthe Von Beeftingh, the butcher, jeeringly
said that the marrow bone of Van Zwakborstig's conceit
ought to be knocked to splintersyet as the person
spoken
of was a tall man, and warped in the shoulders, he
made out to look down on such petty malice: so having
conquered all things and opposers at home, Mynheer,
who was not one to lay and rust like a nail,
bethought
him of an astonishing ideano less than of
making a visit to the Vaderland, for the sake of
improvement
,
and being polished like a gentleman: so having
petitioned the honourable and awful council of Antony
Colve for permission, which was granted, to depart, with
12*
the addition of that excellent warrior's giving Mynheer
a military travelling title: (though by the by, he had
never handled any weapon except a saw or a hammer:)
he set out, and after a time returned so much
edified
and smoothed by his journey, that the whole
colony was thrown in amazement: without denial,
he was surprisingly alteredand it was astonishing
to hear him tip his `daden,' that is, tell the
marvellous
adventures he encountered in Hollandhow he
had seen the great gloobs in the Stadt huisand viewed
the pictures of the naval fights of the De Witts, and many
other wondrous things:and above all how he rode a
quarter of a mile upon a jackass, behind the
Stadtholder's
youngest son, who sought of the intelligent Van
Zwakborstig sundry pertinent queries concerning the
colony
of Nieuw Nederlandtssuch as if the moon shone at
Nieuw Amsterdam as bright as at the Haguewhether
the people were not a scalping set of savage brutes and
baboons, of which last mentioned quadruped his high
mightiness most condescendingly was pleased to remark
he judged very favourably, on account of the specimen
with whom he was conversing:overwhelmed by which
compliment, the Mynheer made the most lowly
acknowledgment
.
And further he related that at a splendid
service, whereat the new Prince of Orange was sworn in
office, at the new kerk at Amsterdam, that through the
favour of the afore-mentioned Heer he had an excellent
seat near the grand organ, besides the satisfaction of
looking vastly pompous, to the infinite mortification of
Schepin Olisteen, who happened at the same period to be
also in the Vaderlandand although a big man at home,
he was in Mynheer's words, in Holland, nien more den
is vone hone dat you might wet your wit a dop on;
but then what could be expected of a baker, for such
had been Olisteen's tradeand poor devil that he was,
he nearly got knocked down in attempting to smoke his
pipe in the crowd.
Van Zwakborstig had also many more glorious events
that befell him which there is here no room to mention,
but they can be found among the records of the stadt,
in the same volume wherein is detailed the admirable
voyage made by that famous navigator Hartz Kruger, to
the unknowne countrie of Madagascare;
[44]
[44]
Vide the early volumes of records in the Register's office in and
for the city and county of New-York.
for Mynheer
had it all written down in a clear, legible and round
Dutch text, by Dominie Megapolensis, that such an
extremely
interesting and accurate history should not be
lost to posterity. Nevertheless, Mynheer did not bring
only bare words back from his tour, for his return was
accompanied by sundry chef d'uvres of the Dutch
artists
,
as is remembered to this day, from his unbounded
liberalityfor in the generosity of his heart he bestowed
on the Stadt one Amsterdam Apollo without a nose,
moulded at the lime kilns in Overyssel; a Venus, cut by
Edric Vanderkunderspuke, without a leg; and a Cupid
and Psyche without heads but of admirable form, the one
being dressed in a field marshal's uniform and the other
in a hoop and stomacher. Besides these, he robbed the
old country for the benefit of the new, of a number of the
finest engravings, as he himself said, in the world
together
with the stoel which first introduced this account
of him, and which had in reality belonged to the learned
Professor Von Rospinygen, of Leyden; and on whose
account Mynheer was admitted a member of most of the
philosophical associations of the province; the principal
of which is well known to have been der Knoflook und
Vleesch club, that used every once a year to assemble at
the sign of the Egg and Gridiron, near the Beaver Lick, to
eat sour krout. Now, though it is in some wise advisable
for all who wish to imitate the worthy just written of, to
travel, and amuse themselves with the wonders of foreign
partsyet it must be confessed they too often forget their
own native country, being filled with the virtues of others:
and indeed such has been this evil, that scarce any of our
witless and conceited coxcombs have stirred abroad, but
what they have come back loaded with folly and pedantry
and in these there is no addition desired to our growth;
for there are numbers among us who, crowded to
the very throat with the mightiness of their own
opinions
,
consider the judgment they deign to bestow on any
subject whatever, (not caring how abstruse or beyond
them it may be,) of that importance, that it is a final fiat
which is to build or destroy its being and existencefor
it is not more evident than remarkable, that the more
vanity
a man is possessed of, the more he is wanting in
understanding
and
the puerile and ignorant are always the
most dogmatical; and indeed it is no wiseuncommon for
some to insist on their pretensions to wisdom, and as the
vacant skull of a fool has little difficulty in raising a throne
to its own conceit, they can argue themselves and those
who in capacity are their kindred in the same belieffor
it is not unnatural for the simpleton and the idiot to
worship
each other.
But while the relation of the goed vrouw's ancestor
has led on to the remark just concluded, the poor
neglected
dame has waited our leisure with more patience
than she would have waited that of her husband's. She
has been eager this some time past, and ready to be
formally
acquainted with the reader had there been an
opportunity
;
so it would not now be treating her as she
ought to be, to keep her longer in suspense, for she was
truly a personage of authority:and she was surrounded
by her subjects animate and inanimateon her one side
was the moveable cupboard of the Antwerp make, with
its pannelled doors and brass handles, gorgeous with
cleaningon the other stood the slaubonk, serving the
several purposes of a bed, table, and dresser, while all
around the kitchen were marshalled hosts of pots, kettles,
and cooking utensils of every shape and fashion. Here
were barrels cut down into seats, such as are seen in the
paintings of the Flemish mastersthere were the earthen
bowls of Long Island, which almost outdid even the
Dutch manufactures themselvesand lastly, high up the
chimney might be seen the blackened carcass of the
green goose, that was smoking for the approaching
New-Year
,
and whose delightful and delicate perfume filled
the whole apartment; for however economy at other
times might rule the domain of Mynheer Vanderspeigl,
on the solemn feast of Sainte Claus he opened his soul
and his heart; and surely he would not have had a drop
of Dutch blood in his veins had it been otherwise.
Nevertheless
,
ere the matron speaks, for after that there
will be no chance, it must be premised that however
strenuous mevrouw was in upholding the dignity of her
Dutch extraction, she had somewhat deserted the
ancient
faith, having left the brief and steady homilies of
Dominie Van Gieson attracted by the more powerful and
spirit working holding forths of that sanctified, pure, holy
and precious brother in truth and spirit, Mass Baregrace
Trebletext; who, chosen appointed, and beloved vessel
of the believing, had received a blessed call, to the
infinite
dissatisfaction, mortification, and disadvantage of the
above named Dominie, all the way from Jericho and
Babylon, where he was busied growing onions, to
pour forth from his lank and lanthorn jaws, nasal and
long winded denunciations against the carnal
transgressions
of the worldly minded backsliders of the
Manahadoes
.

But shall have some great honour shortly.
Pli. Brother,
He's a rare man, believe me!
Kas. Hold your peace.
Here comes the t'other rare man.
Save you, captain.
The Alchymist
.
The subject is proceeded in
.
As I am a living woman, it is a dreadful night,
quoth dame Yokupminshie, pausing at her occupation,
and stopping for a moment the whirling course of the
wheel at which she was employed, as she listened
anxiously
to the dreary and hollow sound of the angry wind
that rushed by with flight swifter than the antelope, shaking
the stout walls of the ferry house almost to their
foundation
,
and driving the eddying smoke back from the
chimney
,
so that in fleeting clouds it rolled among the beams
and rafters of the apartmentwhile accompanying gouts
of soot and wet lumps of dust and clay loosened and
driven down from the crannies, dimmed for a moment,
the clear and lively blaze of the ascending fire.
Sooth, continued the matron, the heaven is as
dark as the storm and clouds can make it: and yet I
aver, it compares not with the black evil and foul
savouring
courses of those who wallow in the mire of worldly
sensuality and blindness: dear me, dear me! to think on
the wickedness of the carnal creaturesthe crying sins
of mandear me, dear me! and she heaved from the
bottom of her heart, a deep sigh, or rather groan, and
clasping her hands across her bosom, she rolled her eyes
upwards devoutlya murrain on thee, coistrel knave,
pursued Vrouw Vanderspeigl, starting from the
meditation
which she was about entering on, as a provoking
flourish of Yonne's fiddle broke on her musingsher
voice rising to its shrillest tone as she spoke, so that its
sharp echoes pierced the farthest nook of the building
a murrain on thee, saucy knavewith thy rioting and
lewd canticles, one would believe you was at a boosing
bout, rather than in the decent dwelling and tarrying
place of a follower of the word: have done, for
momently
I expect the pleasant youth, brother Tribulation
Wholesome, who is one that seeketh not the cares of the
body, nor minds the tempest; seeing that he means to
hold forth within our earthly tabernacle: so I enjoin you
to silence, that I may hear his coming.
Deare me, misseelor pless you, ter moosic clebber
'nough, him make ony little noise, returned Yonne in a
deprecating tone, dough Massa Boomelhyser preak ter

Mercies on me! said the matron, unattending to
his expostulation, and casting her eyes round on her
progeny
,
what a set of imps; alack, if that cub, Stoffel, an't
got his doublet out at his kneeyet it was but morn, that
I patched it with the grey jerkin of his father: dear me,
dear me, what a life one leads with them allmend and
work, even from the rise to the set of sun: troth there
is not time wherewithal to commune on the health of
the spirit, nor drive from the thoughts, with manifold
taskings, the divers rank abominations and unclean
profanations
of the flesh, even as Deacon Zerubbabel
Bare-bones
rightly terms them, the temporal sins and vanities
of the world.
Ah now, mudder, do let Yonne play one more,
besought
a chubby and shining faced urchin, in a coaxing
voice.
Loramittee, let ter little ting hab him desire,
exclaimed
the slave, backing a request which was
consonant
to his own wish, ony missee hear me play ter

remarked the righteous elder Hopeful Clapp, when his
crop of onions grew to seed and he lost thereby a
portague
:
verily, I am resigned even unto this measure,
since there cannot be a change thereof.
Lor, me hear ter water roar at ter hell-gat, as plain
as me see youpless us, what a time is comingony
listenter chimney crumbles as him plit, said Yonne,
and at the same time smoothing the rough coat of the
disturbed animal reclining at his feet, he added, still
Snoocherbeast, hush ty tongueLor, vy der debbil
you no be still?
There is even a great gathering of the elements,
and it moves me exceedingly for the coming of the
absent
Tribulation: stir up the fire, that he may abide here
in warmthand Yonne, get unto the pronk room, and
take from the great chest the quilt that hath the
Stadtholder's
hunt thereon, worked by the hands of the
respectable
maiden Minstrie Snedigher, that was of kin to
my godfather, who came from the Doele-straat of
Amsterdam
,
having followed the reputable calling of baard
schraper
to the Dolen Huisand mind, Yonne, that the best bed
is aired, that the pious master Wholesome may have all
that pertains to his comfortand Yonne, take the new
pair of striped blanketsand Yonne, tarry not long, for
even as I speak, I hear some one approach,dear me,
it is not the step of the precious youth, but that of the
brute, my husband: alack, how the sight of the man of
sin disturbs mefor multitudinous are his ill doingsso
that when I lay me by his side at night, my spirit is
greatly moved that the wicked is nearand there
appears unto me, that I look on the horned beast of the
Revelations: mercies on me, Sporus, what have you
been afterwho is it Yonne says you've been talking
with?
As she spoke, the door was roughly thrown open, and
the Mienheer entered grumbling, growling, and swearing
in notes as gruff and hoarse as a hungered bear, and ready
to vent the gall which overflowed him on the first thing that
came in his way; no sooner was his entrance effected
than the bright eyes and ruddy cheeks of the children
were dressed in smiles, as pure and innocent as those with
which the summer flowers greet the dawn, while with
glad cries they hailed his approach, and skipped forward
with all the light hearted gaiety of sorrowless infancy to
meet and welcome him, and hear the loved sounds of his
well-known voice.
Vanderspeigl was a harsh and selfish man, holding no
sympathy for aught than that which furthered his own
immediate enjoyment, and having no constitutional
feelings
except those of avarice and indolence, for like
thousands
who make up the great herd of mankind, his whole
existence centered in his gold, and he prized the
possession
of wealth beyond all other earthly objects, and
almost
the goods to come; yet there was one fair trait in
his character, it was a love for his children, and what
heart, it may be inquired, however base or hard, is
without
that affectionand yet in the breast of human beings
there are such:to some, the dearest, fondest ties of
kindred, the most sacred bonds of blood are as slight and
feeble as a hair, and as easy to be broken; but such,
though he wear a finer form, is but a monster, a brute,
unfit to be ranked with the vilest of creation. What is
more daily cried up as honourable and excellent than the
love of familydo not men award it praise? but such
incentives are needless, are superflous; that which is
duty it is criminal to omit, but it shows how rare, even
though it is so, that it is fulfilled, since it is so greatly
lauded. Yet what parent, let him be cast in nature's
coarsest mould, rough and uneducated, but must melt
into womanish mildness when surrounded with his little
ones and feeling their gentle endearments, when the soft
warm cheek presses against his, wooing their roughness,
and the weak, tender, and waxen arms twine for love and
support about his neck, like the feeble vine of the
honeysuckle
about a towering columnor hears the delightful
lispings, the wild and broken prattle, the music of their
little lips, breathed on the parental bosom like the cooings
of ring doves on the tree of lifeindeed, one would
suppose
it beyond humanity not to delight in these. Men
have been who spurned all ties that bound them to
mankind
,
who have been as the savage panther watching the
roaming elk, ready ever to spring, lacerate, and devour
the very vitals of their fellow, and yet with a boundless
devotion they have gloated even to adoration on their own
offspring, and would, though selfish in all other respects,
have perished piecemeal in tortures the most cruel and
Vol. I. 13
rending, ere one moment's adversity should reach the
objects
of their worshipand still, so depraved are
mankind
,
that there hath been the reverse of this: there are
those who have from birth shunned and persecuted as an
enemy the fruits of their bodies, have exposed them naked
from infancy to the pitiless scorn and buffetings of the
world, and have, rock-like, heard their cries for help;
rolling in riches, they have bid them waste by famine,
nor would stretch out the hand of relief;yet worse than
these hath there been, trampling on the rights of one
child to exalt another, seeing one laid in the grave
tearless
for the inheritance of a favourite; but so often deals
fate, that the one preferred is the instrument of vengeance
in this life, as imitating, by force of example, the selfish
feelings of the parent, the child turns the persecutor, for
like the light on the flamingo's wing, which brightens but
a moment and then is lost in the surrounding night,
many times the kindnesses of nature which blaze in
youth's spring tide are quenched and obliterated to apathy
as they are tainted by the breath of societyand the care
worn guardian of childhood receives for his countless
anxieties and sacrifices, the withering coldness of
ingratitude
or desertion; so it is not uncommon to remark, that
help in misfortune, balm to misery, and the outstretched
hand of renovation is sooner extended and received from
the stranger than the closest by name and blood.
But the Nederlander was in no mood of love, his shaggy
brows were contracted in a deep and surly frown, and
appeared like dark clouds when swollen with a tempest;
he took no notice of the children's jocund visages, but
with a rude motion he dashed aside their outspread arms,
and without answering his wife's questions he stalked
sullenly
to the fire and seated himself
Got tam! sall Ik hab nien biece? nien, nien,
growled
out the Dutchman, as the dame repeated her
interrogatories
,
op myn zeil! der sdorm ish in der huis mit

Mercies! what a taking the man's in, quickly
retorted
the matron, the whole asperity of her composition
filling her countenance with spite and sourness, for she
was not one who was to be so spoken to with impunity,
nor ever took one word without giving in return a dozen,
or in other sense, without showing as good as was brought
her. A fine humour to be sureyou are not to be spoken
with, I suppose; dear me, I did but task him with a word,
and thus he turns upon me, showing the lowness of his
breedingtruly did sister Hepzibah Praise-the-Lord,
aver, at our last love-feast, that out of a dunghill one

He addressed the last words enforced by a violent blow
to the ears of one of the little urchins, who, with cautious
and timid glances, had venturously approached within the
reach of his hand; the varlet no sooner felt the injury,
than with loud screams, enforced far beyond the extent
of his hurt, he sought shelter in the arms of his mother,
where experience on former occasions of the same kind,
had taught the rogue that he was sure to receive more
caresses than, in proportion to the ill-treatment of his
father
,
he deserved, and which he was cunning enough to
perceive was usually extended as much from direct
opposition
,
and to irritate her spouse as from real concern.
A murrain on the man! he'd better snap one's head off
art crazed to beat poor Stoffel without cause,
exclaimed
mevrouw, as she took the boy in her arms and stilled
his sobs and cries; hush, mind not his ill naturedear
me, he'll weep his heart out. You ungrateful man,
continued
she, bouncing from her seat towards her helpmate,
was it to be treated thus I condescended to marry you,
when I was well off in the world. Was not my father the
schipper of a hoy that belonged to the great house of
Mynheers Jan Jansen, Alperdam, Lunden,
Vanderschroper
& Brodersdid not my poor dear first husband that's
dead and gone, Rip Van Schaik, leave me as comfortable
a widow as any in Yorkewas not I far above you,
you low, dirty wretch! when I married, you had scarce a
rag on your back, and not a friend in the worldhad I
not a whole houseful of relationsand have I not had a
first rate English education, from the worthy Baalim
Snipe, who kept an academy in Queen-streetdid I not
prefer you, you unmindful and forgetful villain, to the
precious
pastor Habbakuk Alsermon, who, although he had
but one eye and one leg, would have refreshed me with
the good word and the outpourings of the spiritdoth
not your conscience bespeak my wordly superiority, in
which I take no pride, for pride is an abomination of the
harlot that is throned on the seven hillsyet so I am
repaid
for my sacrifices by the rank and bitter waters of
the cup of tribulation. Dear me! dear me! that my poor
dear first man, Rip Van Schaick, was alive this day.
How much longer the incorrigible dame would have
pursued her advantage, for her invectives seemed a
never-exhausting weapon, and fell on the head of the
offender
in an unsparing floodfor she granted, being
fairly set out, little or no quarter to her astounded spouse,
who was deafened by the rapidity of her declamation and
the sharpness of her thrustsit is impossible to be
ascertained
;
for words of reproach flew as swift to her
tongue as she could utter them, and rendered no chance
of her being pacified as long as she could speak: and
how long that would be was difficult to conjecture, for
every sentence seemed to come out with stronger
emphasis
and shriller voicehowever relief came, unlooked
for as suddenas her attention, at the expression of the
wish above narrated, was called to a loud knocking at the
outer door of the ferry house. No sooner was the sound
repeated, than the dog, who alarmed and affrighted at the
violence of his mistress as she rated Mynheer, had
crouched
silently in a corner of the kitchen, and fearfully eyed
the parties askance, sprang on his feet, and answered with
loud and determined barkings the halloos of the
disturbers
.
Tish dey alredemien Got! zo zoon as vone weineg
minnit! cried the Dutchman starting up, mien hondred
biecesjamien geldtGod tam, Snoocher, hond sdil
dien blaffen, and as he added the last words he gave
the noisy animal a heavy blow with his foot in the ribs,
that sent him across the floor, yelping, howling, and
moaning piteously with pain.
Mercies on us! the man's mad, stark madyou've
killed the poor beasthere Snoocher, here, said the
wife, motioning the bruised creature to her; but the oft
ill treated quadruped, cautious of her protection, and
unaccustomed
to the call of friendship from so questionable
a quarter, only raised his head heavily at the sound, and
crawled limping to the feet of Yonne, who at the moment
returned from an inner chamber, where he had been
preparing
for the reception of the goodly Mass Tribulation
Wholesome. The black soon soothed his dumb
companion
,
who crouched in a heap, answered his caresses by
whining affectionately as it looked in his face, and by
licking gratefully the hand that patted his back.
Let the dog be, Yonne, and see who seeks entrance
I trow both the brute and thou art alike, said dame
Yokupminshie petulantly; dear me, it must be the
precious
brother come at length. To him, Sporus, I will
tell thy conduct, and put you to shamemercies on us!
if I mistake not there are more voices than one; God
willing, the pious Hezekiah Holdfast, or some other of
the brethren accompanies his righteous mission
therefore
hasten and unclose the door; and Stoffel, put wood
on the fire, that the good men may have cheer.
Leib it staan, slaafzo as dou obensh it, op myn
zeil, ik mill preak dien kop mit mien knokkles,
ejaculated
Vanderspeigl, interposing with vehement action the
motion of the negro, and thrusting his unwieldy form
between
Yonne and the door with an alertness of
movement
that his huge bulk scarce appeared capable of
attaining
,
ja, dis is nien blace vor dem inkoomenmien
Gotik ish verleizer vone hondred bieces alredeja.
Who hath ever hearkened the like, exclaimed the
enraged matron, regarding him as though she could, in
13*
the common phrase, eat him, thou babel of iniquity
that beareth visible marks of the serpent, thy heart is like
the Levites of old. What, wouldst thou detain the
gifted
Tribulation, and the reverend Hezekiah on the
outside
of the house in this storm? thou sinnerbut thou
shalt be stricken with a mighty mourning and repentance
for these black indulgences of thy carnal mind against the
faithful and elect; and manifold wailings and gnashings
of teeth shall give testimony thereof Mind not the
wordings of the Philistine, Yonne, but I bid thee unbar
the door to the chosen of Israel.
Dirtyfordy dousand duyvildis is vone verdamnt
dingja, ik ish nien zo mush mashder in dis mien huis, zo
as is mien negur, Got tam!
A murrain on the black! why lingerest thou slave,
cried the vrouw, her eyes flashing with wrath and venom,
and her natural shrillness of note increased almost to a
scream, will you not mind me? Negro, an in a minute
thou dost not do my bid, I'll break every bone in thy
black skin; and for him, let him stop you an he dares;
and she regarded Sporus with an Amazonian grin of
ineffable
contempt, and placed her arms a-kimbo. Have I
not made him a man, the ugly, dunghill born curbut it
is ever so in matching beneath one. Nevertheless, do
you mind to do as I tell thee, or we'll see who's
mistress.
Vanderspeigl gave no answer to this tirade that could
reach the virago's hearing; but slowly and reluctantly
withdrawing himself from before Yonne, he regarded his
gentle helpmate with a grim visage, expressive of rage
and stifled hateand from the bottom of his lungs he
sent forth a deep growl, or rather a revengeful grunt of
displeasure and gall; and at the same time giving way to
the abusive violence of the termagant, he sheepishly hung
his head with an awkward air of submission, and thrusting
his hand into his breeches, he drew forth a large clumsy
iron tobacco pouch, curiously figured and decorated, and
taking from its interior a considerable portion of its
contents
,
he filled one side of his mouth with an enormous
piece of the spleen dispelling herb; and on which, from
the earnestness with which he seemed to attack it, he
appeared to vent all his disappointment and venomfor
his countenance quickly expelling its rueful elongation,
looked as clear, stolid and unmoveable, as though nothing
whatever had intervened to disturb his quietude. In the
meanwhile poor Yonne, perplexed and awe struck, and
scarce knowing which party to obey or which way to
turn, for he had his Scylla and Charybdis on either side,
cast fearful, hesitating, and doubtful glances from one to
the other: however, perceiving the dame's cheek flushed
and her eye lighten towards him like a fiery meteor, as she
addressed her rhapsody to his alarmed ears, and aroused
by his master's equanimity lest she should be tempted
to turn the irresistible torrent of her expostulations and
wrath altogether on his head, and being also well satisfied
as to the general issue of such matrimonial conflicts, he
opined and proceeded as best for his own security, though
with a cunning appearance of reluctance, to unclose the
entrance; but here a serious disappointment awaited the
eager and expectant matrontwo persons indeed
presented
themselves for admittance, but they were neither the
precious Tribulation, nor his co-mate Hezekiah, nor, by
their garb and appearance, followers of the word: dame
Yokupminshie, whose hospitality and charity was of a
careful kind, and seldom or ever without good reasons or
weighty inducements, extended farther than towards her
own immediate sect, as it was her firm belief that all the
rest of the world were a set of graceless sinners, for
whom there was no redemptionthat is literally, they
all deserved to be damned to all eternity; and as the
quality of the strangers was not easily to be perceived,
for both were enveloped from head to foot in large
mantles
,
which were loaded with snow and dripping with
water from every fold, and which entirely concealed
their figuresshe therefore fell back several steps, while
her countenance underwent an instantaneous change
from every expression of welcome that had for a time
taken possession of her sharp and skinny features, to
that of the utmost forbidding ill will and morose
selfishness
and
it was extremely probable, from the glances
which she cast on them, whether, if already they had
not entered the door, they would have been able to have
made a shelter in the house at all.
We are loth and sorry to disturb or incommode you,
honest friends, quoth the foremost, shaking the damp
from his cloak, and addressing both the Dutchman and
his wife, as with surprise, he perceived neither advanced
to greet himfor while Vanderspeigl stood aloof in
sullen silence, his spouse, who had at first sprang so
eagerly
forward to receive her expected co-religionists, had
now petulantly retreated towards her spinning-wheel,
and almost turned her back on the persons whose
presence
had so grievously disappointed her wisheswe
are strangers, continued he, just landed from the
ocean; our vessel lying in the sound, and unable to make
a safe anchorage till lightbut being desirous of reaching
the city, if possible, we have sought your hostel, that
we may obtain warmth for our almost frozen limbs, and
guidance on our way.
And what may your name be, and what is your
business
?
demanded mevrouw, turning suddenly round,
and viewing him strictly with the pert gaze of impudent
curiosity.
I deem that, good woman, entirely foreign to my
request, and unnecessary for your satisfaction,
returned
the intruder haughtilyand then moving from
her, he beckoned particularly to Vanderspeigl, who
appeared
solely and assiduously occupied in rolling the
tobacco
from one side of his mouth to the other, in such a
manner, that two liquid streams of juice voided
themselves
over his lips, and coursed down at each side of
his chin; probably from you, master, pursued he, I
may obtain more to the purposespeak out! can we
have that which we seeka guide and temporary
refreshment
from the fierceness of the tempest?
Vanderspeigl
,
however, gave no reply, but continued his
amusement, only raising his eyes with a vacant, dull look
to the speaker's face, and then casting them referringly
to his wife, who, with every muscle of visage contracted
to a more disagreeable aspect, prepared to vent her
spleen and anger at the rebuff she had receivedGood
woman, forsooth! mercies on us! good woman! broke
from her lipsI'd have you to knowhere,
however, the threatening storm was prevented from
bursting, by the interference of the companion of him
who had offended, and who appeared considerably the
elder of the two.
Now, by my halidome, thou art wrong Hal, to bear thee
thus: leave them to mean I do not correct the
outline
,
call me the botch of a dauber, cried he to the
first, as he pushed forward a jolly, red, round, good
humoured
and staring countenance, smirking with smiles,
which an endeavour at gravity, could not disguise to
seriousness
,
and speaking quickly, as impatient at having
been so long in the back groundI beseech thee listen
to our modest asking, honest gentle folkskind, good
peopleby the by, the woman has a most admirable
head, a study for a RembrandtI'll have a sketch of it,
by Saint Paul! You see we want nothing but what we
can pay for; and gad, if you say it, I'll draw your lovely
likeness in the bargainand Hal, you know that
would'nt be aught beneath the art, either; for
Caravagio
,
an you recollect, painted a tavern sign for his
breakfast
.
And at the same time, he advanced boldly towards the
matron with a formal obeisance, and drew forth a purse
apparently well linedin the performance of which
action, he threw back the outer garment in which he had
been wrapt, and discovered a large, thick-set, broad
shouldered, clumsy shaped personage, considerably
inclined
to corpulencywhose appearance was not a
little
displayed by the splendour of his equipments,
which were not lost on the attentive Vanderspeigl, and
the now admiring and observant eye of mevrouw: his
dress was a light coloured embroidered loose coat, made
low in the neck, with immense tails and cuffs, of such
a size that they hung at least a half a yard below the
hand, which last was encircled by a treble row of the finest
Flanders lacehis waistcoat was superbly barred, and
worked and ornamented with large and glittering buttons,
with wide flaps in front, that extended nearly down to
the knee, in the style of the true court gallant of the
day: he also wore a small gold laced, three squared, or
cocked hat, that sat perched like a yellow bird on the
top of a large flaxen periwigwhose fine and graceful
flowing curls, rolled in profusion below the shoulders,
but divided most carefully in front, that the full rotundity
of the wearer's visage might have sufficient space to
show itself; a thin walking rapier hugged his side, and
although a huge pair of travelling jack-boots of the
greatest
dimensions, whose very tops hung loose from their
magnitude round the calf, that they appeared like an
open umbrella reversed and standing on the ferule, cased
his legsyet the silk stockings, and the garters, deep
fringed with silver, were plainly to be perceived. There is
probably, nothing that can command more respect, than a
fine dress and a show of means, well seasoned with
assurance
:
a ragged, slovenly, out at the elbow sort of a
chap, or one of your modest, gentlemanly, unassuming
gentry, will pass unnoticed; yet they may be able and
willing to call for and discharge all debts incurredwhile
a grass-hopping mushroom, just freed from his master's
counter, who flings his purse and oath at the same time in
your face, may with impunity insult every woman he
meets, run over the children, damn the waiters, and
cheat their masters, and still have every attention paid
him even in the places where he is most knownfor a
dashing, roaring blade, meets always an excuse, when an
honest man would have utterly lost his character:
whether convinced of the certainty of this conclusion, or
transfixed by the rapidity of speech, pomp of attire, and
the rattle and glitter of the shining ore held in view, or
whether the strong argument of the stranger's address,
was the inducement, for it seemed likely from the
curtsey
dropped on a sudden by the relenting dame, that she
understood it as an entire compliment to herself; yet it
was equally apparent, that no sooner was the broad piece
presented by the thumb and forefinger of the speaker,
than Sporus, as if at that very instant he had awakened
from a lethargy, or shook the binding and dreamy
cobwebs
of sleep from his eyes, started from his apathy and
pushed himself forward, with an outstretched hand that
seemed envious of the sordid bait, that he might grasp
it into instant possession; while athwart his heavy
countenance
there flitted a grin of pleasure and selfish
delight
,
as he eyed the gold, which doubtless he intended
for a smile of open hearted hospitality, and gracious
repayment
for the money: indeed it was of that species,a
glance which might have been given in return to the
maker of a feast, for all his fine dishesand which
expressed
in language stronger than utterance frames, the
grateful maxim, `fools make feasts, but wise men eat
them;' or rather, that the reader may more forcibly
comprehend the sagacity of Vanderspeigl's look, if he
hath a wife who attends those springes to catch idiots,
termed ladies auctions, only let him recall to mind the
ineffable leer of satisfaction with which the auctioneer
repays
him, when he lays down the amount of a long list
of cheap articles `almost as good as new, and worth as
much again as has been bid for them,' and which speaks
to the utmost, that `the ass and his money hath soon
parted,' and he will have the whole expression of the
sturdy Hollander's countenance before him; but the
proverb, though somewhat musty, carries considerable
truth, `there is many a slip between the cup and the lip,'
and here it was verifiedfor unfortunately at this
momentous
period, by some unaccountable caprice of fate,
the ferrymaster's evil star reigned in the ascendant, for
ere he was able to take due distance towards the object
of his longing desires,even in the very instant it
appeared
within his gripe, he had all but clutched it, when his
wife (and indeed such women will interfere in every
thing) hastily stepped forward(for it is above observed,
the brave garb and clinking purse of the stranger had
made an impression, and had an effect at once ludicrous
and singular on mevrouw, and proved that the mammon
of lucre found an equal savour in her sight, as in that of
Mienheer's, and therefore to her first courtesies, she
added a second lowly inclination of body,) taking,
however
,
a due precaution in the enaction, to receive the
magnet of attraction in her own hand, which she was
careful should be opened for that express purpose: this no
sooner done, than with the greatest precision, and the
nicest accuracy, this worthy better half of the prudent
Nederlander, deposited it in her pocket,while alas, the
misadventures of that unlucky wight, Sporus
Vanderspeigl
,
ended not herefor in his over anxiety to attain
his point, and in the procedure abandoning his used and
wonted caution, by an unguarded movement, he
unfortunately
struck his foot against the end of his wife's
spinning
wheeland before he was well able to recover
from the shock of such an encounter, and hold his
accustomed
equilibrium, (as from the velocity of his
motion
,
his head and feet would have given an apt
explanation
of the extreme points of an angle;) and in order to
regain
his proper balance by way of an assistance, though
probably without ill intention, for a falling and drowning
man, alike will catch at a straw for safety, he struck his
broad palm forcibly against the head of little Stoffel,
who, by the by, was the very image of his father in bib
and tucker, and who, poor varlet, was gazing with
distended
eyes, stretched like saucers by curiosity on the
new comers, entirely unconscious, and by no means
dreaming of so rough a salute. The boy flew screaming
in one directionthe wheel, the cause of all the
disturbance
,
took anotherwhile the ferrymaster, partaking in
his own body somewhat of the properties of a Dutch
herring buss, (which are shaped considerably like a basin,
and are therefore proof against sinking,) regained his
footing after a clumsy struggle, which he closed with a
hearty oath, that with an irresistible force sprang from
his throat as if urged by circumstance, to follow in the
immediate train of the words of welcome that had just
preceded his direful mishap: still there is much doubt,
whether the alertness of his rib had not in part the
power
of mingling more than common bitterness with the
rising phlegm that produced the exclamation, Mien
Gotdis dam ding is altyd in der wegop myn zeil!
Ik hash proke mien scheenbien wid der tam sbiening
weiljamien Got! For indubitably, it is a very
mistaken idea, that supposes man and wife are one
and that all which belong to them are in unison
and that the notion is unfounded, no one was more
thoroughly convinced of than Vanderspeigl, for though
he and his
cara sposa
rested on one couch, and
dwelt under one roof, they had two very separate
customs as to many other material mattersand they
were divided like most married couples, particularly in
their money affairs; for although they both held to the
plan of hoarding it, yet it was in different portions:
that of mevrouw's, to the grievous dissatisfaction of
mynheer
,
being most sacred, and seldom gratifying his view.
Still, nevertheless, ill nature reported, and what will not
ill nature report, that it oftentimes gladdened the sight
of the precious brother Wholesome. However, if this
affirmance hath any truth in it, all evil suggestions shall
be disappointed; for there can be no hesitation in
asserting
that it must have been exhibited for pious and
righteous
purposes alone, judging by the extraordinary value
set on it by the matron.
Mercies on us, how awkward to throw down the
wheel, said the dame peevishly; and you brat, still
your noiseI'll warrant no bones broken. Sweet
master
,
he always bawls thus when least injured, continued
the mother, as the younger stranger lifted the child from
the floor; the heedless goose is ever thrusting his nose
where it should not be. Why dost not stir about, added
she, moving smartly on Yonne, who like his young
master
had been lost in admiration at the splendour and
fashion of the stranger's garments, see you not that the
gentry stand while you dangle your fingers idly before
you. Dear me! Koby get from the fire, hast no more
manners than the prophet's ass. Alack, my good
cavaliers
,
excuse these creatureswhy Sporus man, beast!
must I do all, as did Gideon of old in the Scripture
prithee move thy stumps a bit.
And thus did mevrouw show off her hospitality,
buzzing
about like a fly round a candle light; eager, teasing,
and pressing; endeavouring by her present activity to
erase the remembrance of her first lack of courtesy. A
Vol. I. 14
sudden change seemed to have come to her nature, and
she was now a true semblance of Dutch virtue, generous
and disinterestedthough it may be that at times against
her very will, her wandering thoughts (for such it is
impossible
to control) ran sadly in divers abstruse
calculations
in how great a degree the stranger's purse could
bear diminishing; and as one idea is often apt to keep
pace with another, as naturally as a bird follows its flock,
and we are accustomed to look to the very extent of a
pleasant prospect, so did the goede joffrouw's mind (for
in spite of the battlings with the spirit, she had her carnal
periods of human weakness and visitation and of which,
at task meetings she bitterly complained;) pursue the
subject
to its farthest source, and she even believed it
probable
,
if events turned out as she expected, that she could
afford to appear abroad in a new fardel or vandyke, or at
least with a handsome tasbeetel, that would make the
envious Vrouw Clopper sick with coveting. Therefore it
may be well supposed that her guests were scarcely
seated
,
ere thus urged she made the top of the slaubonk groan
with the enticing contents of her larderwhile her thrifty
husband gazed in wonder and affright at her prodigality;
for indeed she did nothing by halves, when the whim
once actuated her. There was the last made crulershie
shining again with the fat in which they had been
cooked, and towering like an Egyptian pyramid from
the wide earthen dishthere was the milk-white
hominy
and the speckled sackatas, cookery peculiar to
the new world, and unknown to the kokwinkles and
estaminets
of Vaderland, loading and overflowing the clean
wooden bowls that held them, and flanked by huge
flagons
of molassesand again, there was the shattered
remains
of the last meal, thick and greasy slices of smoked
ham fried brown, with the gelid gravy clinging to them
like the snowy foam of the wave frozen upon an ocean
rockthere was the partly demolished dough nuts, the
delight of children,and also the small round Holland
saucers of preserved peaches and cold baked pears, filled
to the very brims with their delicious liquorsand then,
to wash down this feast, came the mighty family
porringers
of Delft make, chased proudly with broad, laughing
bacchantes, and short pug-nosed satyrs and clumsy fauns,
sporting without, and mantling brightly with sweet
flavoured
cider withinwhile the whole was crowned with
long necked, squat, green glass pottles, bursting with the
rich juice of the gooseberry and the golden genever, and
supported by tall, thin, thimble cupped Flemish glasses;
a parade of viands fit for the banquet of a burgomaster.
Gezondheid, exclaimed Mynheer as he filled a cup,
and in one draught swallowed the greater portion of its
contents and held the residue before the light, at the
same time smacking his lips loudly, op myn zeil,
Mynheers
,
dats der drue stduffmien God! it flikkers more
zo as vone weineg ligt der zonblesh mien hertztish
goede, tish der regt ding vor zoopje;gezonheid.
Although the ferry master thus graciously began to do
the honours of his table, and appeared cheerfully to
assent
to the designs of his wife from the very bottom of
his soul, yet every mouthful that disappeared before the
hungry lips of his sharp set guests, seemed in his eyes
like drawing blood from his vitals; but he was forced to
take the part he was actingfor there is no disputing,
that which cannot be mended should be endured with as
good a grace as can be mustered from necessityyet it
went exceedingly against the grain, as he was truly, (as
the reader must remember,) one of those sparing and
economical creatures who are enabled by dint of a discreet
careful, and somewhat ingenious management, to prevent
every thing like waste or profuseness, and who can show
the worth of a little by making it serve for a great deal
and it therefore grieved him mightily, and he waxed
wroth within himself at the uncommon, unnatural, and
unfeeling
want of reflection of the huismoeder's at one time
placing such a bountiful and sumptuous entertainment
before such a couple of unmerciful and unsparing
stomachs
,
(as in his own mind, before they fell to work,) he
had determined were possessed by the strangersand
from this, as of course his idea was strengthened that
every mouthful they devoured was more than sufficient
to have served any moderate and reasonable man with
satisfaction and support for the animal frame, for at least
a month. Indeed it is necessary to mention that no one
could have been more surprised, and even struck aghast
with amazement, than he was at the very production of
the banquetfor like the water that sprung at the stroke
of the lawgiver's rod, it was as though it had flowed from
the barren rock; he could not recall, though he was
conscious he never burthened his memory too much, that
his helpmate had told him of there being such a various
and great quantity of provisions laid by in the house. It is
true he recognised numerous scraps which had in their
time formed parts of his meals, yet it strangely ran in his
recollection
,
that mevrouw had assured him that they had all
been devoured; and so to see them start in being direfully
puzzled himbut all was the fault of his narrow mind
he did not for a moment dream that the matron had
generously
from each particular service set apart a choice bit,
culled out by her own delicate hand, for the taste and
approbation of the gifted man Hezekiah, for the pouring
forth of the word was attended with much bodily labour
and mighty sweatings and strainings of the jaws, and help
and refreshment of strength necessarily was obtained
from the good fare which was always provided for him
when his coming was known; and which he enjoyed while
the Dutchman snored, little believing his high prized and
precious stores where gliding down the throat of the
worthy brother. However the presence of the travellers
had for a while entirely obliterated from Vrouw
Vanderspeigl's
thoughts, the expected visit for this night, and the
share of the neglected Tribulation was marshalled out for
the attack of the voracious mouths of those who seemed
to threaten to leave but little for his temporal comfort.
This is an ungrateful worldsacrifices, benefits, favours
and friendship can at will be shifted off and forgotten
there are but few who are not of that light and fickle kind
who will call to memory an absent acquaintance if they
find it serve a minute's interest to do otherwise:
unconscious
Wholesome, little did he suppose the ill that was
done him as he trudged heartily towards the mansion, his
hollow bowels yearning with expectation. But as to Sporus,
who having carefully considered the matter, came to a
mental
determination, that there ought to be enough left from
the feast for the support of his family for a week, after his
guests were satisfiedyet for the dame's conduct he felt
some anxiety; and it was only the awe in which he held
her expostulations, that prevented him from making up his
mind to act a prudent part: as a due reflection on her
profusion
seemed to absolutely demand his speaking to the
croyer
of the neighbourhood, that he might, after the
example
of an honest Dutchman of the vicinity called Yokup
Van Solingen, who for a doit got clear of many destructive
contracts, by hiring Gottlieb Klokspolenswartz, the little
Schieldterberg croyer (at least a half year after the goods
which had been got were safe housed, though a few days
before the bills came in,) to proclaim three times before
the whipping-post which stood in Duke-street, the
following
lawful notice: O yez, O yez! dis is dat givesh
notish
do all manners von bersons dat sdands do hear dis
broklomashinand dose dat never hears him at alldat
whozoeversh has drushd zo ash a vool, der vrauw von
Yokup Van Solingen, der dater ob Hauns Swagger, widout
her mensche's bermission,u must zee how u kits u
monies. O yez, O yez!words which were brought out
with sundry guttural flourishes, from the harmonious and
clear throat of the strong lunged Gottleib, who, at the
beginning and conclusion, rang manfully a bell, which he
had in his hand, and which had a very moving effect
particularly on the faces and pockets of the creditors,
who were forced, like all persons in such a predicament,
to philosophize, and content themselves that they had no
business to trust, and therefore their loss was of their
own seeking, and it behoved them to make up for it by
cheating the first persons that next dealt with them; for,
after all, Yokup was an extraordinary honest character;
but, poor fellow, he had a wife that, with all his care,
would certainly ruin him. Violently stirred by these
disturbing cogitations, the gray, envious eyes of
Vanderspeigl
,
shot continually eager, greedy, and begrudging
glances, as with silent celerity mighty portions of the
victuals disappeared; with close investigation, he
seemed
14*
to strive to measure the very quantity of each
separate
piece that was swallowed, and which almost
fearfully
dilated in magnitude as he watched its progress to
the lipsfor he believed that every scrap that was
spared was an addition to his wealth; and truly, few
could practice as well as Sporus the difficult custom of
frugality, which however despised, is one of the surest
means of prosperity; for hath it not been, that the saving
of the most insignificant articles, the very preserving of the
blank parts of his correspondents' epistles, have been an
accumulation of profit to many an honest Dutch trader?
and on a like principle Vanderspeigl considered that he was
equally entitled to a handsome return from the persons
entertained as on the present, had his wife set before
them the common fare which supported his familya
broad dish of mush, rendered palatable on extra days,
(such as the anniversary of Binke's Conquest of the
Colony, or the Stadtholder's birthday,) with the juice of
the maple tree, together with a few hard coarse cakes,
known by the name of journey cakes. Although to this
inviting
feast in this instance, he deemed it possible, in
consequence
of the appearance of the company, he might
have ventured without much loss, to add a taste from
one of the long slender flemish goblets that is above
mentionedand which he never allowed to be brought
out except on extraordinary occasion, such as the
festival
of St. Nicholasof his best Hollandts, a liquor, which
on the great day just cited, he was first accustomed
himself
to take down in one gulp, nearly three quarters of the
contents of the glass which he filled, and then after sundry
expressive smacks of his lips, he would pass it to his wife,
who having also done it justice, directed its course, (if
any remained in the vial) alternately through the family,
till its career was ended in Yonne's pouring a certain
sufficiency of water to the rinsing and drops, that
cleaving
to the bottom, had escaped the thirsty tongues of
his superiorsthe procedure of the black being
followed
by a shower of charges from his provident owner,
advising him not to take the liquor strong, lest it should
get in his head, or rather noddle, as Vrouw Yokupminshie
familiarly named it. All these ceremonies having been
fully concluded, and the form and quality of the glass
itself
thoroughly examined and admired, for it had been
imported
from Flushing, and was known to be of the real
Scheiverland blowing,with great precaution in the
fingering
,
it was cleansed, wiped dry, and safely deposited
in the cupboard, until it should again be brought forward
to the light by some other extraordinary event. From
what has been stated, no doubt it has been foreseen that
it was with more than an ordinary degree of satisfaction,
that our Nederlander perceived his guests finish their
repast without suffering their hunger totally to demolish
as much as his views, which were singularly distended
on the occasion, had first comprehended; for in this case
he had looked on the darkest side, and at times, so
hopeless had appeared the prospect, that he had already
deemed it fortunate, were the clingings of the dishes
spared.
Wel moet het u bekoomen Mienheers, quoth the
Hollander at length in a joyous tone, as the strangers
turned from the table, though somewhat damped in his
pleasure, by the movements of the elder guest, whose
eyes still strayed towards the half destroyed meal, as
though doubtful whether he had eaten sufficient while
so much was left still to be devoured, wel moet het u
bekoomen Mienheers, repeated he with a clumsy
courtesy
,
to which the persons addressed made suitable
return
.
It is a miserable storm to encounter, and without
doubt a dreary road we have to traverse, said the
younger traveller, and comrade, the time wears apace;
but I trow an we linger, day will surprise us ere our
journey
be finishedsooth, the wind seems to my ear to
have lost half its ragewhat say youbelike it were as
well we do resume our way?
Now by the skill of Claude, thou art out of keeping,
cavalier, replied his companion, at an hour like this
to fly the free quarters of ease and safety, to madly
breast the tempestand here is a scene that Teniers
might envy and Ostade seek to paint, cast as it were by
design itself in my wayby the fame of Durer, I'll not
budge one jot until I've taken down the grouptroth,
who knows but the interior of a Dutch cottage, by your
humble servant Jost Stoll, of Kakiat, may one day rank
with the masterpieces of him of Nuremburg?
Thou art ever too uncurbed for caution, returned
the other seriously, for rashly, in spite of situation, by
want of guard thou temptest danger; you do forget your
place and duty, sir, thus idly to run out upon a theme
more fit for leisure hoursbethink, this is a time that
doth demand a secret lip and sterner action.
On my troth this might have been spared,
answered
the second, wherein have I disposed me wrong?
you should know I am no awkward boy at the crayon
had I been so, I had never had the honour of kissing the
hand of his sacred Majesty William, at
What boots the reflection now, said the first
hastily
,
and in a sharp tone, interrupting him, does this
uncalled
disclosure serve the king, or perfect the service
on which we are dispatched? let me beg at least, if not
command you, to restrain this feeling that urges you so
simply to betray those things, which for every cause at
present, should be hidmy report of a repetition, sir,
might not forward your favour at home.
The person rebuked hesitated a moment, but checked
the reply that hung on his tongue, and drawing his seat
close to the light, he drew his tablets from his pocket,
and glancing minutely round the apartment, he appeared
busied in transferring the form of its contents on the
vellum.
We must further trespass on your kidness, host,
continued the first stranger, addressing Vanderspeigl,
it behooves us to reach the city as soon as we can
perform
the taskand if by the procurement of horses to
bear us thither, and an accompanying guide, you will
contribute to the speedy effecting of our intention of
travelthy beasts shall neither lack provender, nor their
owner rewardhow say you, master?
Blesh mien zeil! dis nagt do der Stadt, said Sporus,
amazed, and shaking his head with a rueful gesture, at
what seemed to him the madness of proposal, mien Got
dis ish more dan zo mush as vone ding op den myl

Three days to go ten milesby the classic brush of
Van Tulden, a great stretch of canvass, exclaimed the
elder guest, pausing and looking up from his
employment
,
master, hold thy head a little a one side, that
the strong shadow may rest on thy nosethe other way
there, the broad light suits the expressionadmirable
admirable!a beautiful mezzotint, by the freedom of
Adrian Brouwer. The Hollander gazed at the speaker
in astonishment.
Whatever difficulties are to be met, they must be
overcome; to us danger will be no detention, pursued
the firstcome, to the pointcan we obtain the horses
required? I repeat again, you shall not repent our
payment
for any alacrity you exert to oblige us.
Horshpaard! goot Gotdat u zay, said the
Nederlander twisting his countenance to its most
lugubrious
aspect, u dinks Ik hab dwodree paardop

Dear me, dear me! what a creature you are, said
vrouw Yockupminshie, interposing after an uncommon
length of silence on her part, which can only be
accounted
for by her having been busied in
superintending
Yonne's removal of the remnants of the meal
that had been set before the travellers; but having
caught a portion of what was passing, and finding her
spouse seem strangely backward, inattentive probably,
from fears of his precious person, which alone he valued
above his gain, she pushed forward determined to use her
authority in perfecting the seeking of the guests
mercies on us, said she, thy heart, Sporus, is like
unto a cage which is filled with unclean birds, as the
goodly
master Trebletext says of the heathenYonne, take
care you do not crack that jarthou art as blind to all
things, as were the deluded men of Babylon unto the
words of the prophetwas there ever such a lazy black

can ride and tie, as did the worthy brethren Nehemiah
Adams, and Zachariah Canter, who rode unto this
wilderness
in the glory of the Lord, on one steed, from
Waterfordhaving nothing in their saddlebags whereon
to subsist, but a dozen onions and some butter milk
creamah me, the trials of the faithfuland thou,
dumb dog, hearkenest thou not that you will have a fair
return for the usage of the animal?
Don't make such wry and woeful faces man, I shall
never be able to catch your likenessby my halidome I
shall make you as mean a figure as that in the hundred
guilders print of Rembrandt: hold still, by the cartoons,
that's the very positionwhat noble shadows; the hand
of a Pietro Longo is wanting, it is beyond Jost Stoll, said
the elder, enwrapt with the drawing at which he was
evidently
employed.
The children had slowly, as their awe of the stranger
decreased, by perceiving him engaged at something which
they were unable to comprehend, but which aroused their
curiosity, crowded round him, and now being unrepulsed,
with eager sight glanced over his shoulders.
What do you think of that my little manwhat does
it look like? You have the eye of a painter, you rogue; I
see you like itwhat a pity it is you know nothing about
tints, composition, rules, manner, effect, air, and freedom;
but you are an amateur, you young dog, I see it by your
look, and with all the self delight, and satisfied
admiration
imaginable, he held up his tablet to the gaze of one
of the little urchins, first close, and then further and
further
,
and at last at arms length.
There's correctness of outlinethere's picturesque
gracethere's a groupdon't talk of Vosterman, of
Hemskirk, of Hollar, or Bloemart, whilewho the
devil's this? something for the back ground; all it
wanted
,
by the slovenliness of Vander-Kabel
Mercies on me! here comes likewise one, said the
matron, who will lend his mite to those in need, even
his beast of burthen, doubtless, for a proper and
reasonable
recompense. Thou art truly welcome unto my
tabernacle
,
brother Tribulation Wholesome!
As she spoke, the door which had been left unbarred
since the travellers' arrival, was gently opened with one
of those conscious timid pushes, which bespeaks the
character
of the mover, and the vacancy that was left, was
immediately filled, and the sight of all present greeted by
the remarkable person of the righteous young man yclept
Tribulation Wholesome, who meekly entered. This
worthy was a thin, gaunt, lank, spare, raw-boned anatomy
of a man, so tall that his head, as if from a secret feeling of
awkwardness in height, projected forward several inches
before his body, like the upper beam or arm in the
ancient
erection of a gallows; but so low was the Dutch
ceiling of the ferry house, or rather the bare rafters of
the Nederlander's kitchen, that in spite of this unnatural
inclination, his skull came at intervals incautiously in
contact
with them. He possessed a long hollow-cheeked
visage, through the dry parchment hued covering of
which, every motion of his wide and alligator-like jaw
was plainly perceptible; the colour of his skin was pale,
and nearly approached to the dye of the mahogany, his
nose excepted, which, probably by way of ornament,
hung out in shape of a pot hook, and was tastefully
studded
by sundry precious purple and blood red carbuncles
to the utmost end, that outvied the eminent lustre of the
claret tint which pervaded the rest of this excellent
appendage
of the human features; in brief, it must be
admitted
,
there was not much novelty in the object, for our
paths are full of vessels of the like kind, and which is
more commonly known to the spectator by the
designation
of a brandy nose, or one blooming with rum blossoms;
yet be not reader inclined by this evidence, for the pious
and abstemious Tribulation never drank aught stronger
than water, at least so his own lips bore testimony. Now
be that as it may, all assent to the truth of the maxim,
`a good nose is worth a kingdom,' as is here proved,
for being weak of eye, the said primary portion of the
countenance served to support and uplift unto the
assistance
of the secondary planets a huge pair of leather bound
green goggles, through which his red and ferret orbs
twinkled in all the pomp of certain wisdom;and indeed
the custom of wearing glasses looks wonderfully learned
and studious, and in these times is much followed,
particularly
by ladies, who wish to be supposed extensive
readers, and therefore mount them whenever they can be
seen, and also by youngsters, who believe they give them
a scientific appearance, and shows at any rate that they
have read all the late novels, in which the whole
literature
of the present day consists; indeed, when one has
read the wretched scraps of nonsense collected in the
pages of a journal, and skimmed over the watery and
fulsome leaves of the last new tale, in his own opinion
his education as a critic and a man of letters is completed;
and every ruffled fopling and hollow blockhead thus
armed
,
sets himself up as an oracle, whose judgment is
definitive
and not to be disputedbut to proceed in the
description
,
in which wrong will be done if a due chance is
not given to the amiable person of Master Wholesome, a
superiority to whom few could boast, as even his mouth
was a model for a statuary, for when opened it presented
to the inquiring view, a species of forest, where trees,
trunks, bramble bushes and rocks, flourish in rich
luxuriance
,
for it was laid out, or rather irregularly lined with
a row of large black stumps and putrid broken teeth,
which, from their relative situation with each other,
appeared
somewhat like a scattered and unarranged crowd
in earnest conversation, and over which at times floated
a zephyr, not sweet as musk above the bulbul's nest, but
somewhat like a breeze of garlic over a bed of assaftida.
His stilt-like legs were half-enveloped in a rusty, greasy,
leathern doublet, which was so tight to the body that the
slightest stirring of the muscles was visible, and the
remainder
was cased in a covering of blue yarn hose, thickly
spotted, to the exclusion of its original hue, with divers
party coloured darns, and withal, worn in mighty holes
in sundry placesbut the flesh of the wearer, although
seen through these unlucky gaps, probably from the
pinching severity of the cold, could scarcely be
recognized
rom the garment in colour. His outer dress was
a large loose cloth jerkin, worn extremely
threadbare
,
and seeming, from its shortness of length and
width of body, remarkably adapted for a small, squabby,
hogshead built character, and in no wise fitting for the
gainly and comely form of Tribulationwho, had he
condescended to wear a linen garment, but in which
article
of comfort, it was reported that his wardrobe was
singularly deficient and scant, it is likely from the numerous
ruptures in the jerkin just mentioned, some stray
perspectives
might have perchance been visibleand further,
the sleeves of this gaberdine, either on account of their
original want, or from a sudden growth of the wearer,
merely served, by kindly and with great consideration
stopping
above the wrist, to set off both the huge bones of that
joint, and a hand that exeedingly resembled a warming
pan, and which by exposure to the bleak blasts of the
stormy weather, was interchangeably of a delicate brown,
blue, red, and indeed of every tinge except its natural
white, being also of a wondrous horny substance.
This delectable personage, in consideration of his special
attainments, and marvellous proper personal appearance,
was like most men, in his own conceit, a worthy of
extraordinary
and profound qualificationsand moreover, in
high favour with most of the matrons and maidens of
the neighbourhood, at whose dwellings he was always a
welcome visitorfor joined to his private capacity and
calling, that of a travelling preacher and tinker, he was
the public leader of psalmsbeing tune setter at the
meetings of the faithful; and from the pursuance of
this profession, to a natural snuffing note, he now had
obtained a canting, nasal, guttural, quavering method of
enunciation in common parlance, so that when he began
a sentence, however short, in a low key, it gradually
rose to the highest stretch of voice ere conclusion
and when started high, the tones diverged, slowly
dropping down; until the last note was almost
unintelligible
to the hearing: all this was melody to the musical
ears of Vrouw Vanderspeigl and other admiring gossips ;
and it was often discoursed among them, on what a
blessed gift of utterance had been granted unto the
precious
and chosen youth Wholesomeand that young
man, be assured, was not a little vain and gratified by
such just eulogiumsfor natheless, he was thus
affectionately
termed a youth, it was only in the word, for
Tribulation was no chicken, as was signified by sundry
marks of the years of discretion in his personsuch as
certain deep indentions or wrinkles on the forehead, and
divers stray hairs among his close cropped and carrotty
locks, that seemed fast changing their original fiery cast,
and plainly announced this discreet boy to have
sometime
cut his teeth, and past the age of infancyor in
other words, to have seen at least a half a century:
however, this did not allay his assiduity in any manner
and so frequent and so long was the time spent by him in
pious pilgrimages to the warm homesteads of the honest
Dutch landsmenbut where by his own accurate
relation
,
his whole solicitude was engaged in the righteous
employment of holding forth for the prosperity of the
temporal sojourns of his misguided fellow creatures in
this world, with the godly given females whom he
visited
,
that from his preference by the sex, either through
envy, or for the sake of truly describing his predilections,
he commonly was known, and passed currently in the way
of derision, among the males, (but this slur he scarce
noticed
,)
by the expressive appellation of sister Wholesome."
Ye're well in the body, I take it, dame," out spoke
in salutation, or rather, sonorously chanted the man of
psalmody, as with two or three prodigious strides his
shovel shaped feet cleared the intervening space between
the door and fire-place, while his long arms swung out
as he stalked forward, like the sails of a windmill in a
gale, on my salvation, it hath been as smart a storm as
that wherein Jonah, the elected of the Lord, was cast
from overboard a ship wherein he had embarked, fleeing
from Tyre unto the land of Gershon, and whereon being
swallowed by a hugeous fish, he did remain within the
bowels thereof, for three days and three nights before
he was released therefrom and cast unto dry land,as I
take it, there will, dame, be a clever snow before
daylight
doubtless, if so please the Lord.
Having uttered these words without taking
cognizance
of any other person than the favoured matron
whom he addressed, he placed his form, or as he
himself
in his own clear manner would have explained,
squatted the body down in the nearest vacant seat, which
he dragged close into the fire without regard to the
situation or disturbance of the companyand crossing
his legs, he rested his elbows on his knees, and spread
out his broad hands before the blaze that sparkled
warmly
from the hearth.
Dear me, thy coming has been mightily longed for,
brother Wholesome, how hast thou tarried thus?
anxiously
inquired Vrouw Yokupminshie.
I felt weakened in spirit, quoth he in return, and
stopped even in my path, to put up in secret a prayer,
and vow, as did Jeptha, the holy Judge of Israel, that
I might in communing, renovate my inward manso I
wended unto the tents of sisters Charity and Patience
Praise-the-Lord, who, I take it, are monstrous clever
womenfor under their hands I became restored, yea I
was made whole through the means of the word and a
mouthful of peach brandy, which on my salvation, did
much to warm my stomach, and give peace unto the
yearning of my bowels.
Mercies on me! but thou hast come in good time
yet I grieve me for thy mishap, Tribulation Wholesome,
rejoined the matron, however, here are two men that
seeketh for beasts of labour, that they may pursue their
journeyalso, they lack a guide, for their going is of
moment as they statecannot you, brother, assist them
on their way, which lieth, albeit, in despite of the night
and the storm, as they represent, unto the city?
Ye're not in a mistake, on my salvation, sister
Yokupminshie
Vanderspeigl, drawled out Tribulation,
having
first rolled his eyes askance in his goggles on the
travellers, and feeling wondrous satisfied with the
survey
,
You know, I take it, that little resteth in my
power, but please the Lord, what I can do, that will I
although my nag wants a sure foot, and the creatur, I
take it, is ailing with an attaint that may approach unto
a spavin, and so labouring, it would be an abomination to
work him: yet, as I take it, there is balm in Gilead,
therefore I will venture his strength for a moderate
surety.
I trow, friend, if we can use your horse, and take
your services, you shall not feel dissatisfied at the
repayment
,
said the younger stranger.
Eh!whyI take it we shan't quarrel, answered
the righteous Wholesome, now for the first time,
pretending
to notice that others were present besides himself and
the dame, by giving a certain bob or jerk of the head,
which he meant for an obeisance, on my salvation I
do not think, howsoever, that the creatur is worse than
Baalam's ass, after all, though he does balk at times
but you are clever men, I take itand as Abraham said
when he purchased of Ephron the Hittite, the cave of
Machpelah, that was the burial place of his family, what
matters a few shekels betwixt me and thee? I have
hitched
him just by the door, and if you will scan him, I doubt not
you will find him a beast suitable for thy purposes; for on
my salvation, it was but last week I rode him unto praver
meeting, with sister Remarkable Hobbs, and brothers Ezra
and Gulian Perschieghts, all mounted on his back, and
he went as gentle as a lamb led unto sacrifice, yet he
was guided alone by a manger halter.
After thus delivering himself, with the same
unceremonious
manner that marked his first action and
movement's
,
but with a more gracious expression of visage,
he arose, and having first with a social bend of his neck,
lifted the black jack, which stood on the slaubonk as yet
unremoved, to his mouth, he took a long and deep
draught from its contents, and then beckoning the
company
to follow, he led the way, assisted by Yonne, who
had hastily provided himself with a lanthorn, towards
the schouw huis, at the entrance of which, his steed was
fastened.
A finer whole never was conceivedby my
halidome
!
though I wish the fellow would sit a little longer,
that I might throw his spirit in the piece,by the pencil
of Angelo! a nobler study never was; a Vandenvelde
might envy medon't walk so fastlet me catch that
lightjust move your chin, the shadows fall too thick on
the throat, broke from the lips of the elder stranger, as
with a pencil in one hand, and his tablets in the other,
he pursued the party to the door.
The storm still continued, though now much of its
violence was spent; for it was but at intervals that the
snow rose at its breath, like a wavering and curling
celumn
and
swept bare and naked in its course, the hard
and frozen earth, while deep mounds of drifted fleece,
were heaped up against the trees, hillocks, rocks and
hedges: it was one of those fearful lapses of the
tempest
,
that bespeaks that its fury is gathering afresh, and
that its coming will be like the last and forceful charge of
a desperate army, the most blasting and destructive; and
yet at times, there came from the clear sparkling drops, a
warmth that was grateful to the blood; the drifting
particles
were as tears of the heavens, renovating amidst
desolation.
Through wet puddles of dissolved ice, which impeded
the way along the hollow and uneven ground that lay
between
the ferry house and the waters of the creek,
stalked undaunted the ungainly figure of the guiding
Tribulation, tramping and plashing the water and
melting
sleet at each step in every direction: close after him,
moved the travellers, and the slow and heavy footed
Nederlander dragged behind allwhile leaning, or rather
stretching over the half opened doorway of the
dwelling
,
was the long bust and carefully wrapt up head of
mevrouw, as she with one hand held out a flaring lamp,
which she endeavoured to shield from extinguishment,
15*
with a defence of the open palm and fingers of the
otherbut in spite of her precaution, it seemed as if
the angry elements momently threatened the existence
of the lightand sparks of fire driven from the wick
flew wildly around, rendering with their faint, uncertain,
and sudden dying brilliance, the darkness and dreariness
of the night more apparent. Indeed the good dame was
shewing a singular and uncommon anxiety in this
exposure
to the weatherfor she was urging her helpmate to
return, but without success, to get his night-capfor she
said in bitter, shrill, and tender accents, he will, the
obstinate
mule, surely catch a coldand then let's see who
will nurse himas to her, the lord knewshe had her
hands full enough alreadywithout having more trouble
with him. While the matron was thus exhausting herself
to no purpose, the anxious Wholesome turned out his
charger, which underwent a curious and minute
inspection
,
and truly it was worthy of the time spent therein, for
it was a bald-faced, wall-eyed, bare-boned, half-starved
animal, with a back that looked as sharp as a razora thin,
lean body that shewed its whole skeletoneach rib as plain
as a whip cordwith shoulders galled and raw at every
point, while a coarse untrimmed mane, stuck full with
burs, thorns and furze, dried and tangled in the neglected
locks which had been probably untended to ever since
the beast was in summer pasture, covered the neck
and this last, without pride and unassuming, hung drooping
half down to his hoofs, which were grown with huge
uncut
fet locks and added to his other perfections, the
lower
joints of the creature's legs were bound with pasterns
and bandages, to guard the sharp iron shoes of which
there were but two to the four hoofs, from striking and
interfering
to
complete his appearance, this thin-gutted,
and broken-down shadow was without saddle or bridle,
being
nowise vicious, for when mounted he was easily
guided at the option of his rider by a half twisted rope,
the flax of which parted as it passed through the hand,
and this halter was merely fastened about the neck of
the gallant steed, without troubling the animal's mouth
or head.
You will not hap on a cleverer beast I take it,
remarked
the precious Mass Wholesome, as confidently he
unbound the animal from the beam round which the
halter
had been tied, and cautiously led the reluctant
quadruped
a few paceson my salvation I might have
swopped and traded him three weeks past with Garry Von
Enghen, or Mony Van Slyck that keeps the public at
Bloomaendael, and is an exceeding good judge of
horse-flesh
,
(seeing moreover he belongs to our meeting) for a
copper bowl and three pounds of tobacco, booting his old
Flanders mare, which had no fault except being a little
close sightedbut I give me not unto the carnal and
abominable transactions of the men of mammon, for the
Lord be praised, I am blessed with a charitable and

disposition, I seek to divide my mite with those who
have need thereoftherefore I object not unto lending
thee this beast of carriage, merely asking at thy paying

not be beyond the value of the service.

lucky dog am Ithat chance should give me such
opportunities
who

Potter, or some other great artists of animal life, will go
hand in hand surprising the lover of the ancients with the
skill of the moderns.
The sum is not out the way I take it, pursued
Tribulation
,
after a scrutinizing pause to give the travellers
an opportunity of accepting his offer, for which however,
they appeared by no means eager. The creature looketh
not in his accustomed trim; howbeit he hath come some
distance, and show is but vanity, yet on my salvation his
condition exceeds most
Here the steed, which seemed not at all satisfied at
this unusual disturbance of his rest and comfort, for he had
counted no doubt on the long inaction, with which he was
wonted to be solaced whenever his possessor paid his holy
visits to his sisters in the spiritslipped and stumbled
woefully along the icy groundbeing either off guard
and unprepared to display his points, or owing probably
to a certain uselessness of the vision, one of his optics of
intelligence being in a total eclipse, and the other scarce
superior in guidance. This miscarriage of the charger was
followed by a loud and undissembled roar of glee from the
expressive lips of Yonne, that made all ring again, while
the fallen countenance of the devout Wholesome
elongated
to a doleful and dire length at the flat contradiction
given to his immaculate affirmance by his faultless courser,
and being truly confused he failed in his endeavours
to explain, that the only cause of the quadruped, or
rather
triped's misfortune arose from his tail getting
between
his hind legs, where being of unmanageable
dimensions
it impeded the use of all those after limbs. In spite of
this position which he strongly enforced by reasons
incontrovertible
the
strangers seemed unwilling to risk
themselves
on the animal's back, and to the discontent of the
precious brother it was arranged that they should proceed
on foot under the guidance of Sporus, whose assent after
considerable persuasion together with the powerful
argument
of several pieces of silver, was obtained to the
agreement. However, the goodly Tribulation was not to
be so thrown out, as his mind for some idea best known to
himself was fixed on accompanying the partyand it is
just to suppose, his eye was engaged in measuring out a
share of the purse, which was so carelessly lavished by
the strangers, or otherwise he could not have been
induced
to forego the recreation and pious amusement of
holding forth the word with the righteous damsel
Yokupminshie
Vanderspeigl. So, under pretence of his
interference
being of some weight in procuring horses from
the farm houses on the route, he volunteered himself and
nagshunning, with singular disinterestedness, the very
profitable discussion carefully preserved by the vrouw
for him in the enticing and inviting shape of cold venison,
pasty, and the divers remnants of the good fare set before
the travellers. The matron however, unconscionable
woman
,
looked on the departure of the pslam-setter in a
very different light from that which he desired, and as a
dereliction from his whilome duty stuck deeply in her
breast; and, if the reports of the period state rightly,
it was no small space of time ere the incautious Mass
Wholesome regained her favour. His mare being
adjusted
for the journey by the dexterous hands of Yonne,
under
the peculiar care of his wifewho seemed from the
conduct of the brother to have suddenly awakened to
bestow
peculiar attention on MienheerVanderspeigl was
straightway accoutred in a huge and warm overcoat
which was fastened by a leathern belt about his waist,
and this also accommodated the neck of a stone bottle
well filled with brandtwyn; a thick red flannel
night-cap
shielded his ears from the cold, being snugly covered
by his hat, the broad brim of which was brought down by a
large cotton muffler tied in a vast and voluminous knot
under his chin, while his hands were confined in a pair
of thick knitted mittens, with but a thumb and forefinger
separate, which grasped a short copper mounted whip,
with a head figured of brassthe broad heels also of
his jack boots, were ornamented with monstrous iron
spurs, weighing at least a pound: thus gallantly and
safely equipped, he marched forth as warm a little
Dutchman
as ever rode on a stormy night. Nevertheless though
attired, his difficulties were not endedfor he encountered
considerable trouble in mounting his mareyet after
numerous
failures and slippings off on one side as he was
uplifted on the other, he was at last securely seated in
the high peaked saddle, with his feet dangling in and out
of the wide wooden stirrups, somewhat to a danger of
his keeping an equilibrium. Indeed the ferrymaster was
not a great horseman, although the animal that bore him
was equally as gentle as the one on which the Records of
Nieuw Nederlandts inform us, that Pieter Van Doever,
the honest hangman of Nieuw Amsterdam rode (when
before a public execution, he exhibited the halter to the
good burghers) and which he borrowed from Kouse Van
Ranst, who let him have it for a skipple of wheat, being
the most foundered beast he hadand astride of which,
Pieter looked like a mounted meal bag, for he always wore a
cocked hat and a white wig. In the guise above set out,
the Nederlander led the way, closely followed by the
two travellers, one of whom was obliged, until the party
had got without hearing, to turn back to the calls of the
Vrouw every minute to receive some new charge and
command, which Vanderspeigl was to fulfil on his way
for she enjoined him to recollect that he should inquire
the prices of certain articles of wear at the city, and
that he should not neglect certain calls, and that he
should take care of himself, and not get in difficulty, and
lastly, that he should not forget to buy a long list of
things, which she separately and minutely tried to
impress
on his memorywhile she scarce noticed
Tribulation
who brought up the rear of the cavalcade, perched
on the back of his meagre spectre-looking nag, with his
long lank legs stretched stiffly and stoutly out at least a
yard from the sides of the horse like the fins of a fish,
while his red lean neck, peering forward to the utmost,
brought the curved point of his nose at every jolt and
concussion nearly in contact with the half raised ear of
the short winded and hard trotting creature that
carried
him. Indeed a natural risibility at the singular
appearance
of their attendants moved the travellers until
they had progressed on their journey a considerable
distance
the
further events of which, are more largely
detailed
in the succeeding section.
SECTION III.
The night upon the earth is bent,
And the cold wind bloweth loud,
The close ground's sparkling with the snow
Whiter than a dead man's shroud;
Like a thousand scattered diamonds glow,
And with a thousand shadowings blent
In one white flood the storm doth rave,
O'erwhelming nature in a snowy grave.
THE JOURNEY AND THE TEMPEST.
Taking a route entirely in an opposite direction from
the river, the party proceeded for some time over a clear
and level country, here and there scantily strown with
the poplar and wild locust, and thickets of leafless
underwood
,
fast dying to rottenness beneath the eager tread of
winter, and outspread far and near, with one vast and
wide sheet of snow, that within its huge embrace hid
every vestige of green and verdure that the unpitying
frost had spared. A wild, desolate, and dreary aspect
pervaded
all, and as the last glimpse of the habitation of man
died away with the ferry-house they were leaving, it
looked as though the travellers had entered on a
boundless
and trackless wilderness, which had heretofore been
untrodden by a step of human life. Their eyes so late
cheered by the blazing hearth of Vanderspeigl's home,
and unaccustomed to the ghastly whiteness that shone
from the earth o'er which they trod, and the thick
blackness
of the atmosphere, that like a funeral mantle crowded
on them, at first almost refused to distinguish the nearer
objects; but as their sight grew used to these, in spite of
the gloomy visage of the cloudy and lowering heavens,
the savage, barren prospect, unchequered with a sign of
pleasure, was laid before the view, plain and palpable in
cold and icy magnificence. At times, as they hastened on
some dusky stump, crowned with sleet, disrobed of all its
livery, stunted and bowing low and mournful before the
wind like an aged man grey-haired with anguish, the very
emblem of decay and death, started suddenly within the
way; and again, right in the path would spring, towering
loftily in solitary splendour, a blasted larch, barkless,
seared, withered, and branchless, rising from the ground
like some infernal god or phantom of lost mortality, with
the snow about it as it were wrapt in a burial garb; and
then the breath of the storm as it flitted above the banks
of drift would drive fiercely and roughly against them,
filling
the air with wild and floating particles of haze, of wet
and yellow leaves and the shattered splinters of the forest,
seeking an entrance into every opening and fold of their
cloaks. And now they would startle upon the courses of
the roaming moose, and the tracks of the savage and
unwieldy
bear were left fresh and vivid as but a moment
before he had passed upon the crisp and sinking snow,
driven forth from his den by the pinching calls of hunger;
deep in the distant solitude, faint as echo, came to their
ears the sharp barkings of the wild fox, and the deceptive
screams of the wakeful lynx aping an infant perishing in
the night; and at times, so close to the path wandered this
tameless and ferocious tyrant of the woods, that the fallen
dampness could not destroy or dissipate the sweet
perfume
of his hide, and fearfully for an encounter would the
travellers grasp their pistolets against the threatening
danger. Once through the dense mist that bound the
horizon, there came, losing strength as it approached,
the afar off report of a musquetoon followed by the whoop
of some belated hunter seeking his watch fire and his
comrades, and an interval scarce ended ere there bounded
in front of their road, affrighted, with his brown neck
arched like an Indian bow and breathing heavily with
speed, a gallant and antlered stag, hieing to the wooded
and the mountain glade for safety, and as his wandering
and distracted eye caught with a sudden and terrified
glance the approaching company, he with redoubled haste
strained the thick muscles of his broad and ample chest
in flightyet this passage, the herald of man's presence,
(for the persecution of the beautiful and innocent ever
follows in the wake of his steps,) was broken and buried
by the wind, as scarce to be known from the mournful
and melancholy murmur of the half frozen rivulet, as it
tinkled over its hollow bed, winding in its course like a
gliding serpent, and wimpling about the rocks and the
blue cakes of ice, the very offspring of its own bosom,
that impeded its once rapid and arrowy flowings.
After a brief journeying along this waste, the road of a
sudden took a different course, and stretching narrowly
on the marshy margin of a considerable piece of water,
the sluggish and nearly sleeping waves of which, gelid
with cold, and half formed in ice, scarce murmured as
they heavily rolled in vast sheets to the shore, became
broken, trackless and uneven, intersected with frequent
sloughs and deep and abrupt hollows filled often with
soft snow, deceiving at a glance the most experienced
sight with a surface of firmness and strength, but which
when risked, instantaneously sank down beneath the
trusting weight, while the water rushed upwards through
the gaps gurgling as with anger, and flooded all above to
a considerable distance, swithering and almost
endangering
the safety of the tempterdried, decayed and
withered
weeds such as line the borders of fresh streams, lay
stricken beneath the feet as though cut down by the
destroying
hand of the mower, yet stiff with clinging icicles
that cracked and crumbled in pieces when trod on
stagnant
pools, swoln and half mud, bound in a thin and
fragile
covering of fresh made ice, as weak as isinglass, and
often fenced with sharp rushes that bristled around them
like pointed stakes, were momently to be leaped by those
on foot, while the riders and their horses floundered
clumsily through the fords, casting on every side the
black dirt that lined the very depths, and often from the
dangerous sliding and stumbling of the hoofs on the slimy
edges of these pit-holes clearing them at the very risk of
the horsemen's livesthe travellers had not proceeded
long ere they felt the fatigue arising from the pursuance
of a route against such difficulties and roughness of
ground.
Vol. I. 16
From the period of setting forth, until this part of their
travel, but very little conversation, to what, from the
characters, might have been expected, had passed
between
them, and it was not until they had finished the
toilsome task of wading through the miry, quaggy and
unsound road, and had by dint of great exertion, gained
the hard and stony ground that extended beyond it, that
the path, which had began slightly to ascend, yet in an
extreme rugged and difficult manner and shelving above
the bed of the creek, admitted any regular or formal
attempts at social speech, besides exclamations, and now
and then a cry for assistance, or an assurance of
encouragement
in their mutual perils, as they dragged
themselves
through the impeding bogs, drawing their bodies
wearily and heavily along. Slow and with tiresome efforts
they mounted the way which now gradually wound
towards
a gloomy line of hill and forest that skirted far
across the countryyet on one side, while rocks, woods,
and crags, like white spectres rose wildly above them, on
the other, a quick descent showed a deep, black abyss,
far down, in which scarce distinguishable, the waters by
whose brink they late had passed lay sullenly chafing the
mountain's root, looking like a lake of inkand close
behind crept one dense and unpiercable mass of mist
and darkness.
By my halidome, this view repays one for an age of
toil and hardship, here broke out the elder traveller, as
with delighted eye he gazed upon the wild and stormy
scene around him, yea! yon is the very heaven that
Romain
de Hooghe copied in his deluge at Coerverdon,by
the pallet of Tempesta, this shall not be lostin spite of
the night, from this rock, I may catch a portion of the
landscape, and who can tell, that when I, now Jost Stoll,
ensign of the province, next kiss the hand of his majesty
William the third, he may speak to me as he would to a
La Fage, a Redenger, or a Van Kuelenbut I must
hasten
lest those black troops of clouds flit on
Was there ever such childish madnesssuch
unguarded
folly, said the companion in a bitter tone, and
seemingly highly angered and provokeda boy might
better have been trusted with that on which depend
men's lives than theedid I not warn thee before, Sir,
to silence, yet now you have added to the fault which was
so lately reprovedby my troth, if these men be in want
of hearing, the wilderness may have ears you wot not of
nay Sir, you need not lay your hand upon your sword
I say again this is neither time nor place to indulge
your idle humour.
Pardon, friend Hal, returned the other, you know
I am touchy, and however just, your reproof was galling
I was in errorbut what man of tastewho that like
me has seen the paintings at Hampton-Courtthe works
of Andrea Mantegnaof Guidoof Caracci
Enough, ensign, interposed the younger; look to
the desert we are traversing, for an you set out to sketch
every glade we pass, I shall not marvel but morning will
see us either frozen into statues or buried beneath the
tornado which is again gathering over us.
The road was now followed awhile in silence, but
which was shortly broken by another of the party;and
this was Mass Tribulation, whose spirit had a long time
been contending within him for utterance; for however
the dangers of the way during their partial existence
employed
his curious and active mind, yet the bone
breaking
jolts of his limping steed, which at every step either
flung him prostrate and almost breathless along the hind
quarters of the animal, or as by way of reversion forced
him to forego the mastery of the halter, and cling with
quickness for the preservance of his carcass, by both
arms to the neck of the jaded beastwere not
sufficient
to drive from him a certain inquiring and searching
vein which began stoutly to move him, and which soon
betokened itself by sundry stray and singular queries,
which he sought at convenient opportunities to put at the
strangers, particularly to the younger, in whom appeared
somewhat of authority beyond the senior; and although
the answers he received had little of satisfaction or
encouragement
in them, he still perservered in his curiosity.
Indeed, no rebuff had on him the least effect; for the
godly youth's assurance was naturally imperturbableand
like that spirit which has been universally adopted by our
modern journalists, extremely capable of every change,
and comfortable to the security of its possessorin short,
he was endued with those excellent feelings that will take
no offence, or will not understand the most pointed insult
if not convenient to receive it; and like the ignoble
spaniel
,
the more he was abused if he thought it would gain
him any thing, the more patiently he would bear, and
fawn on the hand which struck him. Indeed, he was a
creature of that hardened cast of visage which once set,
it was a matter of difficulty to discompose, and therefore
although heretofore completely driven from the point he
wished to gain, he remodelled his attempt; and a cold
and unsatisfactory return to some preliminary remark,
was unable to overawe him, or prevent his again aiming
at the same object.
Ye're not much used to sich going, I take it, droned
forth the pious psalmsetter, varying his key at every
word, as was his custom, and abruptly dragging his gaunt
limbs across the steed which he bestrode, so that with a
very slight inclination of body, which was given by the
motion of the horse, his sugar-loaf shaped hat came in
contact with the visage of the person he addressed, to the
imminent danger of his sight; yea, on my salvation they
bear similitude unto the unwholesome doings and ways of
man, which are strewed even like to this on which we
journey, with numerous darksome and dolorous pits, from
whose depths cometh mighty wailings, and repentance,
and direful moaning and tribulation, even as is set down
in the tenth hymn, which goeth in long metre. I take it
as ye're late from beyond sea, that ye can guess
whether the man William, whom they call king, is like to
succeed over him they name James. And truly I
wonder
,
natheless I inwardly opine whether thou art not laden
with words for the ear of Jacob Leisler, even he who is
the temporal ruler of the colony since the fleeing of the
boaster Nicholson.
At every breathing space in this harangue, which he
whined and drawled forth word by word to an exceeding
length, through his capacious nostrils, (these last adding
their melody to perfect the cadence of his delivery;) he
made at least a minute's pause, possibly with the hope that
he might obtain some information in repayment for his
dolorous
exercise of lungs; but he to whom he spoke
seemed
placable and content to endure the whole flood of the
sermon, a taciturn hearer: but this was not what
Tribulation
wanted, as, although few men delighted more in the
patience of his listeners, yet he was at this period rather
desirous of being spoken to than of keeping up the whole
burden of the conversation. He therefore, chagrined at
his disappointment, yet as in a pleasant mood, guided his
charger's head to the side of the elder stranger, whose
good natured looks had early proclaimed that silence was
painful to him; and in the same snuffling notes the worthy
brother proceeded. I take it ye've found the way tedious
on my salvation, three times have I liked to fall from
the back of the dumb brute that beareth me, the Lord
preserve me from a fourth chanceI suppose likely ye're
seeking to trade at Yorke with notions, or sich like
things are dull, sister Hepzibah Gotobed says, that she
could not sell a bushel of cabbages there to any profitI
take it the niggers from the Jarseys cut up that
business
.
Why who in the devil's name do you take us for?
warmly returned the man questioned, somewhat nettled

he placed himself firmly, putting on a fierce look, and
blowing up his cheeks until his face resembled a fiery
ball, and at the same time he manfully touched the hilt of
his rapieryour situation did not call for such a rebuke,
pursued the enraged ensign, and as I am a soldier

Naynay SirI am drawing without rule, my lines
are all wrong, said Jost Stoll, his warmth of feeling dying
away as a sudden reflection forced him to perceive the
incautious conduct into which he betrayed himself, and
the full extent of the danger which might arise from the
knowledge he had already made known to the guides by
his former remarksI did not think as I spokebut I
have done illhere, Hal's my hand, let's not allow a
quarrel between old comradesI shall strive to act

drawing himself up and turning to the pacific Tribulation
I see it is merely proving the saw, that it is throwing
pearl to swine to discourse with thee.
The dignity intended to have been thrown into this
sentence, however was entirely lost on the person to
whom the reproof was pointed, for he made now no
attempt
at an answer, nor appeared desirous in any manner
to continue the discourse, for it seemed as if a sudden
change had taken place in his very disposition, which
may hereafter be divinedyet what had first fallen from
the ensign had been differently received by hima slight
grin moved his features with the same power as a
loosened
anvil, and disclosed the putrid population of his jaws;
indeed, the thin, long, hollow, and half-starved
countenance
of the precious Tribulation was for an instant
lighted up as with a certain satisfaction of his inward
spirit
,
(as he might have described it) as though from the
remarks
that had passed he had gathered something of more
than ordinary importance to his self interest; and truly so
satisfied did he appear with what he had obtained, that
he did not anew strive in any way to pursue his seeking,
and although for a short period be anxiously, probably
in hopes that further words of moment might be dropped,
endeavoured to keep up with the rest of the cavalcade,
which now at the desire of the younger stranger
pursued
the way at a brisker pace, which was often
remonstrated
against by the Dutchman, who complained in a
lugubrious
accent dat his paard would loosh mores wind as
was in his bodiesyet finding all remained silent, the
wily Wholesome by degrees began to linger behind, in
such a manner, however, as to excite no suspicion
except
as wearied by the difficulties of the road.
By this time, the narrow path had assumed a still more
mountainous aspect, presenting at intervals almost
insurmountable
obstacles to the rapid progress of the
travellers
;
for leading up a broken and precipitous ledge of
rock they ascended a passage, or rather gully worn in
the sides of the hill, and which continued its course over
the very brow of the highland, so that in a very short
space the way became so extremely steep and dangerous,
and often the brief line of the rock which they
occupied
was so obstructed by huge projecting pieces of granite
and fragments of grey and shattered crags bedded for
ages in the ravine, that it was rarely possible to keep
the ground abreast, or even to distinguish the route
many yards ahead; and here and there nearly blocking
the further procedure as well as sight, would stretch
forth some scathed tree, whose hundred roots like the
claws of the spider had twisted and warped themselves
in the fissures of the cliffs, half covered with dark
garments
of ice, mingled with the undying and fadeless moss,
while a shower of wet and snow dropped down, as the
passengers passed beneath the bare, solitary and blighted
branches, that still clung to it, and guarded it with
embowering
arms, seeming like the spears of a warrior,
over whom the brunt of the conflict had borne, but who
yet remained, though seared, dauntless and
unconquered
while
far down in the hollow glen to the left, in the
breaks of the dark masses, and shadows of the forest of
wild ash trees, and the tangled copsewood, that clothed
with a shroud of night and cold autumnal dreariness the
ragged edges of the hills, at times could be perceived
some flashing waterfall or distant lagoon, though scarcely
to be marked through the dropping mists, except by
dark or moving spots in the boundless vales of snow,
by which they were encircled: tremors of awe
pervaded
the bosoms of the travellers, as they gazed on the
magnificence of unbridled nature which surrounded
them, and the appalling visage of the wilderness seemed
to impress them as it were with a superhuman voice.
Obliged to surmount such obstructions, contrary to
their wishes, reluctantly being on foot, and forced to use
their utmost energy, the two strangers soon began to
feel greatly fatigued in the accomplishment of their
tedious task, and it was not long, ere symptoms of abated
vigor were manifested in their flagging and slackened
walk, and as they ran o'er many a rapid computation of the
distance they had already journeyed, (for when tired and
exhausted in the pursuance of travel, it appears a
singular
relief to con over the miles we have crossed,)
they began heartily to desire the assistance, which the
ferrymaster at setting out, had stated they were likely to
obtain from some of his neighbouring settlersbut it
was in vain their sight endeavoured to pierce the
surrounding
darkness; the way yet seemed lengthening,
and in spite of their weariness, and what they had
already
combated, new inconveniences presented
themselves
to retard their desired haste; and neither, though
anxiously listened for, did the baying howl of the
guarding
ban-dog proclaim the nearness of an enclosure, nor a
light move its twinkling lustre along the deep vistas of
the close and fantastic figured thickets of hazel and
dwarf oak, that peopled the huge swelling knolls around
them, to give a single hope that a habitation was, in case
of need, attainable: all seemed a lonely solitudeas
desolate and deserted by man, as fitted for the haunt of
the destroying wolf, or the roaming wild cat, whose dens
are in the recesses of the forest, and who fly the human
face.
By my halidome, though this may be a country fit
for a Salvator to study from, it begins to conquer me,
exclaimed Jost Stoll, as he impatiently drew closer
his large cloak against the severity of the
atmosphere
,
and peevishly endeavoured to drag his body
along so as to keep up with his companions, but in the
accomplishment of this necessary exertion, his legs
were forced to contend against a heavy drawback in his
tremendous jackboots, which, whenever they touched
the earth, appeared to take an affection for the soil they
pressedso much so, that they did not part from its
embrace
without carrying away some thick tokens of
remembrance: an I hold out longer, it will be a
miracle
,
continued he, I trow, if some auxiliary in the
shape of horses comes not soon, I shall never finish
another
picture, but shall be left as a league mark in this
dismal wasteby the brush of Parmegiano, a storm looks
well on canvassbut it is rather of sad endurance.
In sooth, I have seldom traversed a more tedious
roadand a worse country I have never seen; I did not
expect that the island itself was so wild and poorly
inhabited
,
said his comrade in reply; ensign, I am as
nearly knocked up as you appear to be; indeed I can
hardly keep feet: and then addressing Vanderspeigl,
he pursued, master, we have crossed a long stretch of
ground, much more than from your dame's account, I
had supposed lay between your dwelling and its
neighbours
and
truth, this road appears to have been but
little usedhave we far yet to go?
The Hollander had, for most of the route, made good
his accustomed silent character, and from being snugly
mounted, he had met less disadvantage from toil, than his
employers, and therefore had full leisure for exercise of
mindthough indeed if he was visited by any thought during
the long interval of absence from speech, which he imposed
on himself, it might have been in what manner he could
most cunningly induce the travellers to add to the sum of
money which he had already received from them for the
use of himself and his string-halted Bucephalusin
driving the one forth in the cold storm, depriving him of
his accustomed warm sleep in his comfortable slaubonk,
and the other from his pleasant straw couch and manger,
but being now aroused by the words just spoken to him,
he answered somewhat testily, no doubt, being teased at
his having been so unceremoniously disturbed in the
midst of some very important reverieMien goot Got!

chilled frames?

At this moment, Tribulation, who had been attracted
by the discourse that was passing and had drawn
himself
towards the party interposedThere dwells
in these parts, said he, a pious and worthy brother,
who is a compounder to the righteous, healing the bitter
words to their ears which the unfaithful cast upon them;
of a certainty, he is a preacher of the truth, and is one
who followeth not the bleating of Jeroboam's calves in
Dan and Bethtel, and he hath pitched his tent a short
ride hence, even a stone's throw, in this howling
wilderness
.
I take it, for a reasonable recompense, forbye
that which the beasts might earn, he will kindly lend unto
ye those of which ye're in need, and at the expense of a
mark, I will, if it please the Lord upon this animal of
mine, go unto the man Job Ne'erdoill, and warn him
of thy neighbourhood and wants.
After a desultory consultation on this offer, it was
determined
as best in the present emergency, that while
the rest slowly proceeded onwards, Mass Wholesome
should seek out the domicile of the patient Job, and
having
obtained from that benevolent personage the loan of
his horses, for whose use, however, the psalmodist was
fully empowered to bargain with him, he then should
make all speed in overtaking the party, which, from the
tardiness they now journeyed, would easily be effected.
In pursuance of this arrangement, Tribulation prepared
to turn his palfrey's head and depart down a small
opening
,
which led from the road on which they were
proceeding
,
and which seemed rather formed by the foot of
the hunter in pursuit of game, or by some beast of the
wild, as a track and path to his den, than as a way to the
house of man; for the bushes and brambles that fringed
the woods at its mouth being trodden down were the only
sign that denoted its existencethe will, however, of the
holy brother was sooner said than donefor a greater
obstacle presented itself to his wish of going in this
narrow
path than he had first imagined, and this was through
the wilfulness of his gallant steedthis creature who was
so honoured in bearing him, and whose various
perfections
have at large been descanted on, added to his other
superior virtues that of balking, and whether he had an
inclination for company and wished to remain with his
nose in the same direction he had set out, it is hard to
discover, at any rate, at the first motion of his rider to
change his position, he placed his forefeet stubbornly a
few paces before his body, and would not in spite and
defiance of sundry kicks, cuffs and knocks which
sounded
hollowly through his lean ribs, broach a single step;
nor was it until he had gallantly endured much abuse,
and gone through divers marvellous evolutions that
threatened
each time an extraordinary display of Tribulation's
agility in loosening him from the seat which he so
manfully
occupied, and after he had been often coaxingly led
forward, that the obstinate animal would in anywise
concede
his will or consent to submit to his master's guidance
and when at last, as if by a sudden freak impelled, he did
set forth, it was at full gallop, over stump and stone, and
down steeps lined with furze and brushwood, as though
flying from the following of an enemy, to whom, as in
daring
,
it sent back his hate by flourishing one hind leg in
flight like the bow of a fiddler ere he begins his melody,
and merely using in progressing the other threeall
however
of which heroic feats were performed to the evident
discomposure of the steady Wholesome;yet adverse to
this slight difference, they made an excellent appearance
together, for from their thin and meagre aspect, both
looked
as though every gust of wind that swept by, would
have blown them away at once.
Is your friend who has just left us, said the traveller
to Vanderspeigl, as Mass Wholesome disappeared through
the trees, always as inqusitive and forward as he has
been to nightor is it the custom of the country to make
such minute inquiries of the business of every wandering
stranger.
Mien vriend, wie dells u datgoot Gothy ish
mien kennisjahy is nien mien gezelschap,
returned
the Hollander shortly and indignantly, blesh mien
hertz, doughzister. Wholesome is mien vrouw's

Well, then, your wife's friend, since it so pleases
you, pursued the other smiling, he is one whose
conduct
appears to me to bear a more than ordinary
concern
in usand I demand at you whether it be usual for
him so to demean himself to all he meets, or if it be now
first assumed towards us?

Finding no advantage from pressing the Nederlander
further on a subject of which he appeared either wilfully
blind and ignorant, or that from his native indolence and
apathy of disposition, he had not troubled himself to
note, the traveller dropped the discourseand all
silently
pursued the way o'er the waste and barren ridge
of wildly varied and continuous hills, which became,
each moment as they progressed, if possible, more
hopelessly
sterile, dreary and disconsolate in aspectthough
in traversing them, their late worn out spirits and frames,
seemed to have gained for a short space, new vigor for
exertion, being renovated in the hopes of receiving early
and speedy succour. But now they had followed the
route for a considerable period beyond that in which
they had solaced themselves in being overtaken by the
messenger Tribulationand yet not the least sign of the
righteous man was discernedthough every shadow,
and aught that resembled life or living thing, was
anxiously
watched for on the expected road. Often, some
dark fir tree, lessened by distance, and shaking its
foliage
in the breeze, would for a time, be likened, by the
busy aid of fancy, into the shape and form of an
approaching
figureand again, some broken and ragged
Vol. I. 17
piece of rock, jutting suddenly and rudely forward at
the very turning of the pathway, would cause the party
to stop and call long and loudly, to direct what appeared
vividly their coming friendsbut it was vainminute
after minute flew swiftly on, yet brought not those looked
for: and although the travellers had not, in all
probability
,
proceeded a half a mile from the spot on which
they had parted with Tribulation, yet full twice the
distance
might have been passed with ease, in a much
shorter circle of departing time: from this delay,
suspicion
in various guise, took possession of the mind;
the strangers were men who had much to fearand
such was their situation, that an instant's detention, might
be fraught with consequences of extending and
destructive
evilnot only to their personal safety, but to
the perfection of the object they were eagerly
hurrying
to attain,still, as the mind buoyed up by hope,
loves to banquet on the luxury which a fair prospect
presents, various excuses for the delay of master
Wholesome
,
at first thronged to them, and served for awhile
to banish unfavourable impressionsyet soon against
these, it became evident that he had either lost their
track, or had designedly deserted them. And truly the
latter supposition, had every fair foundation for its
support
for
as it is above stated, the cunning hypocrite had
been rather incautiously trusted, through his
representations
of the charity of brother Job Ne'erdoill, with a
small earnest of the gold that he was to place in the
kind Job's hands, by way of equivalent to the desired
and generous loan of his animals of labour: and as the
amount received by Wholesome, was what sufficed his
own conscience in the attention he himself had so
condescendingly
and beneficially bestowed on the travellers
it is supposed that his long tarrying was caused by a
secret
dubitation of spirit and reluctance of soul, in parting
with what sat so comfortably in his pocket; yet the
honest
psalmsetter ought not altogether to be considered
capable of such barefaced duplicity, as is here
somewhat
laid to his charge, for as it was afterwards
proved by his own lips, in detailing his experience at
what his sect term the weekly feast of love, the
business
thus befell himthat not having been able
to obtain the relief he was sent after, for Job was a
crusty fellow at times, and like many other saints was
given to some of the carnal ways of man, particularly to
taking too much comfort from strong liquors; and being
at the period whereon Tribulation called on him rather
more disguised than usual on account of the cold, he
would not listen to reason, seeing that Wholesome merely
spoke of his lending his horses by way of benevolence,
carefully keeping back all offer of the money or of any
pay whatever; for he very generously told Job that it was
a crying sin, practised by those wallowing in the gall of
bitterness and the floods of iniquity, to seek for a reward
for that which it was the duty of the brethren to extend,
like the Samaritan of old, unto their fellow men; no
matter whether they were given to the mammon of
unrighteousness
or followers of the word. But all had no
effect on the obdurate Job, who heard him as patiently as
his namesake in the Scripture might have done; and then
with a hearty oath told him to get out of his house, for
he was not in a humour to hear the word.
Being so refused he departed, and thinking it
adviseable
,
as the best way to overtake the travellers, he set
forth to make a circuit of the hills and meet them on their
descent to the commons:which having partly
performed
,
his inward spirit and its outward attendant, (his body,)
wrestled mightily and grievously one against the other
and unfortunately the combat was decided in favour of
the unclean and sinful clay, for having been entirely
unprepared
for so severe a night, he concluded, with a due
share of reluctance and a lengthy debate thereupon, that
he had better seek the earthly tabernacle of his brother
Baregrace Trebletext, who luckily dwelt within a few
yards of the memorable spot whereon he had held the
profound argument aforesaid; where having alighted,
he consulted the divine upon his speculations of the night,
that nothing blameable should be attached unto him;
stating, that he took it that so small a sum as two marks
could not be an object to persons such as he described
the bestowersand that on his salvation they were
Philistines
,
and peradventure worshippers of the scarlet whore
it was therefore, doubtless, a charity to the sinful
wretches, men as he expressed it, blinded and
misled
in spiritual affairs and unconverted in heart; yea, he
went on, it would be as snatching brands from the
burning, if the base lucre should be retained for the
furtherance
of the good word. All of which determination
was strengthened and confirmed by the gifted opinion of
that sanctified and reverend pastor Trebletext, who
always
qualified his remarks with the saving sentence,
God willing, being a true savour of his extraordinary
piety; as is the case with a certain other sacred character
duly ordained but whom it becomes not the unholy to
hint atnevertheless it is worthy of record, as a serious
proof of his zealous spirit of ministry, that having agreed
to serve one set of his admirers, who gave him a call, as
a fat living is termed, he sent them word that, God
willing
,
he would shortly be with them; but lo! even saints'
and holy men's assurances are as liable to failyea, are
as deceptive as carnal laymenso the expectations of
the callers were in vain, and only roused for
disappointment
;
for it came to pass that providence, which feedeth
the hungry, gave the disinterested follower of the Lord
just mentioned, another call elsewhere, whereunto
appertained
much more of the goods of this worldyea, and
the salary was of a greater sum, though the first was not
insignificant. But as the gifts of the Lord are not to be
despised, so he deemed it sufficient to inform by writing
those who were looking first for him, that he could not
come unto them, for lo! God was not willing.
And after this orthodox fashion it was agreed
by Tribulation and his pious pastor, that the sum
should be equally divided between them; which was
performed in the most equitable manner imaginableto
wit, Baregrace received one mark while Tribulation kept
the other, and also an odd piece of money, that he had
neglectedor which, rather, in deference to his purity of
conscience, had entirely slipt his memory to mention.
Meanwhile to the bewildered travellers every
appearance
of a regular or beaten trackway, which until now
had accompanied their labours, and upheld their courage
from entirely sinking, in the faint belief of yet meeting
some hut or sign of the residence of man, began slowly
yet totally to disappear; while the nature of the ground
on which they trod assumed so break-neck and
treacherous
a characterinterchangeably of abrupt ascents
and sudden and broken hollowsthat it became a
risk of life and limb for the ferrymaster to continue in
the saddle; so that now he was obliged to dismount, and
engage with an uncommon activity to sooth or force the
terrified and reluctant animal forward, along the slippery
borders and brinks of precipices, where it looked as
though the slightest falter, or the breath of the night
would have consigned all who ventured to the edges to
certain oblivion and death. Often did the animal start
back from his course, as sensible of the danger that he was
urged to brave; and scarcely when blinded would he
advance
,
while his sides heaved with the beating of his
heart, and he panted in terror.
It was now one of those intervals when the snow
had ceased to descendyet the heavens afforded
not a gleam of light, but were wrapped in a gloomy
and ashen pall, that looked like the trappings of a
burial; still, in one single spot, through a far spread,
round, yet hazy and stormy circlet, shone out the
dying and fading moon, battling for a glimpse of the
earth that it was wont to light, through the huge
voluminous
groups of mustering clouds, that at times were
duskily folded over its faceyet went the travellers
onwards
with nearly a midnight around them, trampling
oftentimes
over the ground bare and naked from the wind,
so that in many places, the lank grass, battling for life
with winter, looked green and felt soft beneath their
tread, until the incautious plashing of their feet, as they
sank in the swampy fen or the morass, would startle the
bittern, the shypoke, the lapwing, or the speckled
curlew
,
who still lingered about their summer couches, the
oozy nests of dank and withered sedge, to give with
17*
shrill, monotonous and plaintive screams, a mournful and
melancholy warning to retrace their steps: and now, the
shadowing, though leafless and forked branches of broad
plumps of ancient oaks, as they drooped above the heads
of the weary journeyers, darkened before and around
them, even beyond the night's blacknesswhile hosts of
sharp, dried saplings that sprang about each parent tree,
barred all further progress, and would force the party to
return back a considerable distance, thriding close and
tangled thickets of thornberry, spicewood, and wild
percimmon
,
whose armed heads tore their garments, and
lacerated their flesh.
Though repeatedly questioned, yet the Dutchman for
a long time, steadily affirmed that they were on the right
route, and at every doubt of such assertion, and as
appearances
seemed to dispute his correctness, such were now
frequently expressed by his companions, he would reply
or mutter a surly and resentful answer.Dat he kennen
der wegh zo goot as oder mensch dat had a nues on his
vaceja! Got tam, said he at one time, apparently
provoked, as he was pestered and examined on his
capacity as a guide, and his knowledge of the road,

mien oogleeden closh as dite zo as vone hang-slotdat

proceeded
he, lifting up both hands in amazement, at the
audacity of supposing him ignorant of the way, wie
has zeen der liksh dat dis is zince mien moeder game
vrom Vlairdengenmien goot Gotja
His assurances now, however, in spite of all his
protestations
,
were fast beginning to lose effect, and
notwithstanding
his natural immovable and imperturbable
coolness of countenance and action, which had
heretofore
been greatly aided by sundry strong and sly
potations
from the stone pottle which depended from his belt,
and whose secret assistance as yet had rendered him
almost
senseless to the attacks of the frosthe
nevertheless
was evidently become disconcerted by the aspect of
the country, yet upheld by a constitutional obstinacy
which strengthens men in error, out of mere daring, and
shame of being convinced of acting wrong, he still
persisted
in leading onward, without, as it soon was
apparent
,
the least certainty, or even idea, of the probable
correctness of the bearing of the direction he was
pursuing
,nor
did he yield in his pertinacity, until assailed
by fears for his own personal safetyand truly this was
to him a most important pointone that he was greatly
careful on, and exceedingly easy to be moved; for like
many others, he was the more anxious about his life and
limb, as they were most worthless; and truly it is from
such preserving and cautious feelings, that so many
knaves deface the fair visage of the earth so much
longer
than retribution for their crimes and villanies ought
rightly to allow. To these movements, in the breast of
Sporus, was now adjoined a secret idea, which was
sternly
embodied on his mind, and which for some time had
been growing even from a small and latent thought, unto
a violent and frame pervading action,the Dutchman
had, between sleeping and wakening, as he was wont to
sit beside his fire at home, unconsciously imbibed from
Yonne's relations, a certain strong belief in the
existence
and earth visitations of supernatural beings; and
often with eager ear, he had drank in the soul
disturbing
descriptions of the black. The sad evidences of
Indian murders, and the damnable effects of the powow
service to the devil by these heathens in their dwellings
of Satan, were at this period, a like terror to the whole
colonyso that by law, the performances of such
mysteries
were punishable with death: and terrific visions
were presented, by the force and circumstance of his
situation
,
to the sensible and susceptible nerves of the Nieuw
Nederlander, however dull of apprehension on matters not
so immediately personal, and his spirit was wonderfully
wrought on, considering that every story he had heard,
was strongly attested; some of the narrators having
gone so far as to say, that if necessary, they would not
mind swearing to what they had beheld on the brass
clasps of Dominie Van Gieson's great parchment
covered
Bible,a folio, whose size and sacredness, was
believed
to be hallowed: and further, as to the very
manner
and distinct dress of the relations, the vividness of
the Hollander's recollection, seemed to perfect itself
nearly in a moment, as he looked about him midst the
darkness of the forest; the groan of the tall pine tree,
disturbed by the blast, as it rushed with the wing of an
eagle o'er its towering crest, the sudden and startling
yell of the ounce, as it roamed abroad in the jungles of
the mountain, were conjured up, and dressed out in the
livery of dire and nameless phantasies of the `woud
gest' and the koubold;and ever and anon, under the
influence
of such disturbing imaginings, with sudden jerks
of the body, Sporus would cast twitching and startled
glances about him as he stalked along, and with a quick
and nervous step, would almost spring close to the side
of his companions in troublewho, extremely angered
at his bearing, after having wandered a long while by
this uncertain and random guidance, at last obtained, by
threats and persuasion, a sullen and dogged confession
of his dilemma, from the obstinate, and equally timid
and stupid Mienheer.
By Saint Paul, this fellow resembles the
composition
of Peter Testa, the engraverhe is all in

,
said Jost Stoll, as the surly ferrymaster crabbedly
informed them of the perilous situation in which his
ignorance
had betrayed themtrow! we have a dark

,
Domenichino never painted more dreadful figures
than we shall cut, an we are forced to linger here till

It is strange you should be thus lost, after such
strong affirmancesand the road is one, that ought to be
known by all who live on the island, said the younger
traveller, sternly gazing on the Hollander.
Mien Got, answered Vanderspeigl dryly, while
every feature remained unbent, or from the darkness,
the stranger was unable to perceive a change, though he
stood at his sidemien Got, said he, Ik dreads der

Curse on that stupid brain of thinewhat are we

can we take? cried the ensign rapidlyimpatient, as
he felt his limbs grow weaker, from the fatigue so
uselessly
endured: it was madnesstempting the wrath
of heaven itself, to venture forth in such a nightwhat
difference could it have made, andmust we perish in
this desert?
Nay, comradeyou know not what you saylet us
keep up a good heartthings may not yet be so
desperate
,
returned his companion calmly, suppose
Mienheer
tries the strength of his Dutch lungs; he has drawn
us in this danger, let him strive to rescue us.
Mien goot mensch, exclaimed Sporus, somewhat
alarmed, u mill niet hab Ik raish der woud duivel

Ay, you rascal, shouted Jost Stoll, any devil, to
help us free of this dismal solitudeso call away, or by
my halidome, I shall be forced to beat you, to keep the
blood warm in my viens.
The Nederlander needed no stronger hint, as the stout
arm of solid animation, which was exhibited by the soldier,
for the time presented an argument more powerful in
Vanderspeigl's sight, than the whole world of spirits;
and long and stoutly did he call: but neither his loud
sounding halloos, nor those of his fellows in affliction,
appeared to receive any answering hail or voice; the
faint echoes of each, as they floated away in the
distance
,
were alone heard in the pauses of the storm; or
were returned by the hoarse scream of some frightened
cormorant, as it rose in alarm from its mountain nest;
and often, such was the din of the blast, that their
strongest efforts were dwindled to the weak cries of
infants
,
and carried away as though unheard, and merely
swelling the whistling of the wind: and now, as if to fill
the dreadful measure of their wretchedness, the
tempest
increased in violence, raging with devastating fury;
at first, a thick shower of dense and sleety rain, came
pouring down, rendering all things around
undistinguishable
;
so that it was in vain, that the eye strained to catch
the outline of some neighbouring object in the black and
dreary expanse, and though at times they fancied shapes
and forms amid the fog, the next moment, a gust of
wind would whirl away the fantastic illusion, and reduce
them to actionless despair; then would come the power
of the blast, rolling at first upon the ear like distant
thunder
,
and seeming to mutter appalling threatsand then
opening in its anger with a noise so deafening, that they
could not speak to each other, for their words were
lost and drowned as in the rushing of wings. The drift
around them was in continual agitation, rolling along in
mighty volumes of strange and changing forms, and so
heavy as to affect respiration: it was useless to struggle
against its careering strength, for every instant the wind
received fresh force, until the trees were almost
uplifted
by the roots, and intermingled with horrible
crashings
,
groaning and creaking incessantly, and shattering
their boughs in a thousand pieces, as they struck against
each other: fibres of wood and torn splinters, were
caught and swept along, and clouds of snow, and of
withered leaves, showered around in every direction:
all was frightful and distracting; one rapid and fearful
tumult, that rendered the mind confused and dizzy with
perturbation. To proceed onwards at random, was
impracticable
,
or only plunging deeper in the disconsolate
difficulties of the waste, in which they were already so
sadly entangled: nor were the travellers able, though
they turned back, to retrace their steps; they examined
the rocks and turnings, the trees and glens, but not one
could they recollect; the full and vivid horror of their
abandonment, alone broke upon them; and it appeared
to differ but little whether they fled away, or remained
to meet the event on the same spot; and indeed they
could not move one single step without risk, or drawing
destruction down on them; while, to complete their
misfortune
,
their limbs became debilitated to the weakness
of striplings, and the piercing and frosty breeze, cut
their flesh to the very bone, with the sharpness of a
tempered
scymetar of a hostile foe; each joint fast stiffened,
and seemed as if rendered moveless and stark, as
touched
by the wand of the magician, death: o'erborne with
fatigue and cold, the horse of the Dutchman sank down
on the snow, and gasping, stretched out its useless limbs;
his master, cast himself in grief, upon the body. The
travellers gazed on each otherthey were separated
far from the homes of menbeyond the voice of
assistance
as
it were, cut off from the peopled world
despair
,
in its most terrific garb, rose to their sightthey
would perishnone could tell where their corses would
be foundthe wild would be their tomba hundred
thoughts of the past, in strange and feverish array, came
thronging and mingling in the scene in which they
acted
they
were as men cast out from their fellows, and
marked for sacrifice: those dreadful feelings which press
like lead upon the bosom, and seem to bid us give o'er
exertion, since it avails not, hung heavy on their
hearts: they wildly with their hands, covered their
eyes, that they might avoid the mental distraction,
occasioned
by the sight of external objects,gradually,
however
,
their alarms and anxieties became less intense; a
sort of stupor, like a cloud, gathered o'er their senses,
and such was the effect of the deadly wind, which they
had so long combatted, and which now was pressing on
to conquest, that a darkness crowded on their braina
drowsiness weighed on their brows, that, combined with
the fatigue and excitement they had been under, seemed
to oppose all exertion: the ensign faintly drew his cloak
across his breast, and dropped down on a bank of snow,
conscious only of existence, by a feeling of vague and
insupportable hopelessness: the younger traveller sat
down beside him, first, as though stupified, and then he
took him by the hand, but the coldness shot in anguish
to his heart; he nearly fell beside his dying comrade;
the howl of a wolf aroused himit was but few paces
off, and rang in his ear like a blow from a gianthe
sprang on his feethe shook the nearly lifeless Jost
Stollhe called on him, and the Dutchman, by name
but they moved not, and he resumed his position beside
them; the energy of his frame relaxed with listlessness
and desperation, like a man who had long been battling
for life in some frail bark, and who at last, is driven to
shipwreck on some unknown, barren and uninhabited
coast, rescued from one death, to meet another more
severe
;
still hope, a desire of life contended within him;
there appeared a baseness and unmanly crouching to
fate, to give up all without another effort; he strived to
awake his failing faculties, which were fast flying him
one after another, and seeking out the splinters of wood
that lay about him, he tried to kindle a firebut in
vainthe wet had sunk to their hearts, and rendered
unavailing his utmost attempts: frustrated in this, he
hung over the shattered branches which he had
collected
,
like the mariner over the skeleton of his stranded
boat, when he gives up all as lost: soon his breath grew
short and thick, as its warmth commingled in the chilled
and icy atmosphere, while the very flood of living fire
that sported in his veins, appeared fast losing the genial
heat on which depended life; his ears began to ring with
stunning and unearthly soundsdistorted and terrific
shadows, in transitory and unsatisfactory bands, swam
before his dim eyes, and he would extend his arms to
catch the passing objects, as if he was grasping at a hold
on earth, which was passing away.
It was not thus I hoped to end my daysto die not
thusnot thus, he said in a short interval of conscious
and heart rending, bitter agony; Oh God! doth here
all those gay prospects of my youth cease in bleak and
hopeless night! Yet what have I deserved? wild
wassail
,
riot, debauchery, hath filled the brief span of my
careless life. I have not acted as my sending on earth
destinedbut wasted in profuseness and extravagance,
health and talents.Out on this infant chidingwhat
now avails complaint in this last hour? is it fitis it
manly that the stern criminal at the gates of death shall
weakly cry on fateon mercyand deprecate the
endless
wo to which the unrestrained hours he led in
hardihood
hath brought him? And yet were my days spared, it
might be, for I am not old, that future times should see
thatbut what matters itthere is no helpthere is no
helpand ifbut I should die as becomes a man, not
cling thus to this foolish, deceiving hope, that makes me
sad at parting as a miser from his treasures.
He lay down amid the withered leaves, while the
snow drifted violently about himpiling around his
prostrate
body like the earth of the grave at the sides of
some uncovered corsehe grew fainter and faintera
dead weight like iron was on his brainthe remembrance
of even his situation was only renewed by fits and starts,
as though perception of created things was nearly lost
but once again his faculties appeared renewed, and he
looked fearfully from side to sidehe gazed upon the
arms of a mighty tree that waved in the wind above him,
and by his distorting vision seemed tottering to a fall;
he wished that the falling timber might crush and
release
him from his miseryhe revelled in the thought
for it seemed as though connexion with the living was
broken, and he retained no human or earthly ties. His
senses swamand his eyes, now weakened to exhaustion,
closed as it were from mere pain; and then there came a
voice close to his ear, as from the lips of his comrade,
yet he scarce heard it, for his limbs grew motionless
stiff-like with the ice of deatha very slumber, tranquil
and senseless was on him, when sudden a sound, sharp
and loud, startled him, and he awoke; the noise petrified
his very frame, but although he strived at first to listen, it
was in vain; yet when again it was repeated, such was
the joy and surprise that pervaded him that he had
almost
relapsed into his former helplessness, for it was the
report of a gun followed by the deep mouthed baying
of a wolf dog, that, even in its roughness, came as
sweet to his ears as music to the listening sick. In an
instant all weakness was fled, his intellectual powers
returned
with increased vigour and acuteness, and
appeared
to vie with each other; while, as he shouted, every
nerve trembled with agitation and fear lest the succour
should not be real, but a mere deception of the sense
and as soon as the call was echoed by the cheerful voice
of man, the blood rushed back in a torrent to the heart,
Vol. I. 18
as with the joyful bound of a stag, and he sunk down
overcome by fatigue and agitation. Thank heaven,
we are saved, we are saved, burst joyfully from his lips,
as he beheld his comrades revived and starting from
their couches of despair and death, as an answer was
twice repeated to his call.
At a short space of time a large dog sprang through
the thicket, and with fierce and malicious barkings darted
towards them; but his ferocity was soon soothed to
silence
by the appearance of a savage looking man who
followed.
Down, Luath, down, thou noisy hound, said the
stranger; and the animal, passive and obedient ran
fawning
about him.
A lanthorn which the man bore in one hand, by its
strong yet transient gleams discovered to the party his
singular, grim and haggard visage, overrun by a grey and
grisly beard, which appeared to have been long unshorn.
He was, as well as could be distinguished, a tall, gaunt,
bony figure; with sinews and muscle that indicated
almost
gigantic strength;a buckskin hunting shirt,
dressed
with the hair outward, hung half way between the hip
and knee, and was tied round his waist with a leathern
thong; his legs were covered with stockings of blanket,
and his feet with socks of deer skin; on his head he wore
a cap made of the hide of some wild animal, but dyed of
a scarlet colour, after the manner of the Indianand in
one hand he held a long-barrelled Spanish musquetoon;
a hatchet and knife, bared to the handle and glittering in
the red light, were stuck in the thong which bound his
garments. He greeted the benighted and perishing
travellers
in a voice, the roughness of whose tone was
strongly contrasted with the kindness intended, and after
a few inquiries of their distress, which was briefly
conveyed
to him, as much by their appearance as words, he
proceeded to state that if their strengths could support
it, he would conduct them where, not many paces distant,
several of his companions, hunters, who had been
bewildered
also in the snow storm in the far pursuit of game,
had been enabled to build their watch-fire within the
shelter of a ruined and deserted hut, and in their name
he offered a share of the succour and scanty protection
which its walls afforded, as to fellow-sufferers by the
tempest
.
Mustering up cheerfully at this speedy chance of
relief their remaining spirit, they blessed him for his
proffered
hospitality, and with an activity scarcely to be
expected
from their worn and weakened frames, they
hastily
prepared to follow the leading of the stranger.
Mien Got! dou gant leive mien merrie behind, cried
Vanderspeigl in a piteous tone, after having endeavoured
to arouse the quadruped which had so long served him;
hy mill berishmien Got! continued he, perceiving
his attempts fruitless, for the poor beast only opened its
eyes to his well known voice, and with an expression
of indescribable anguish, licked the hand that was
extended
to lift his head, and then with a deep moan closed
his sight againmien gotwhat mill the vrouw

in despair and dolor. The promise from the travellers
of a future equivalent for his lossscarce comforted him
and it was to the repeated commands and urgings of
his companions that at last he tore himself away from the
now stark corpse of his once faithful and patient servant.
Den guilder mill nien puy hish weergade op mien

he lingered to gaze back to the spot where lay the body

The rage of the whirlwind appeared now to have
somewhat
passedand the heavens were covered with troops
of flying clouds and wrack like bands hovering on the
rear of a retreating and destroying army: the mist
was so far dissipated that the path could be perceived,
and became easy from the rays of the lanthorn to thride,
and indistinct forms of rock and tree were visible before
the party as they moved along amid the maze of the
forest
.
After having pursued an irregular and winding route
down a narrow and abrupt descent seemingly full of fallen
branches, and stumps of destroyed wood, whose oft
projecting
roots and boughs either rudely overhung or
entirely
blocked for awhile the way, which the leader was
obliged to force for them, they arrived on the brink of a
deep and darksome glen, when turning a clump of alder
bushes to avoid what appeared from the sound the rush
of a powerful fall of waters, but whose flood they could
not distinguish in the gloom, (though ever and anon the
stray blaze from the light, which was held aloft to guide
them, would fall and sparkle upon the jagged fragments
of ice that had been driven aside by the force of the
stream in its progress, and had got wedged and thrown
on the distant cragswhere as the lanthorn went by they
glowed to living chrystal amid the mistand changing
often with magical swiftness they increased their
brilliance
to that of diamonds such as hang on a moorish vest,)
the travellers perceived immediately before them a dusky
line of building wildly situated among the surrounding
cliffs, and on the brow of one it was percheda black and
shapeless mass. A few moments, during which the voice
of the stranger often bade them tread carefully, brought
them before it and allowed them a nearer surveyit was
a hovel roughly thrown up and built in the rugged fashion
of the backwoodsmen of the period, though mixed as
appeared
from their casual observation with the form and
materials
of the wigwam of the untutored savage. The walls
as far as they could judge in the darkness, were
composed
of loose round stone and the trunks of trees, which
were carelessly heaped and cemented together by clay
or mud, the interstices often filled with dried leaves
alonein many places, crotched stakes thrust in the
ground, gave support to the miserable edifice, which
was roofed over with the bark and branches of
untrimmed
brushwood, plucked rudely from the mountain side,
with the long, withered and narrow leaves, and even
berries, still hanging to them: this thatch, however, was
rent and shattered, and large and ragged apertures, were
distinctly perceptible; for though the uncomfortable
looking habitation was of considerable extent, the eaves
and rafters were so low, as to almost touch the ground.
The blackened pile also, in several parts, showed plainly
the hand of time and desertion, for large pieces of stone
had crumbled away, and driven by frequent storms,
strewed the earth about with their splintered and broken
fragments, affording vacancies in the places they had
filled, fit for the ringed and rattled serpent to coil in,
and guard its young and poisonous brood: every part of
this savage dwelling, appeared wild and ruinous, more
like the haunt of the beast of the wilderness, than the
residence of man. As the party approached the hovel,
they passed several square mounds of earth, built
carefully
,
and overhung with thick mats wrought from
rushes
,
and strongly fenced with a hedge, which protected
them from obtruding feetthey were Indian graves
such as the wild follower of the chace hath, in after
years sought out, even in the land of their enemy and
persecutor, by a weary pilgrimage, whose only land
marks, were traditions handed from sire to son; and at
whose verdant bases, they've worshipped the last of
their oppressed race, lonely and solitary, while their
hearts ran o'er in veneration, till they deemed the very
spirits of the old to have awakened to their call, and to
have smiled upon their holy devotions. The travellers
now became sensible of the smell of smoke, which escaped
from the dwelling by means of the numerous holes in
the rafters above mentioned, and which was blown
against them as they advanced, by the gusty wings of
the windand also from the interior of the hut, they
could hear the confused voices of men, intermingled
with the deep and hoarse growlings of dogs; and no
sooner was the latter grateful sound distinguished by the
animal that accompanied their conductor, than he
bounded backwards and forwards joyously, as the party
18*
drew to the entrance of the building, giving loud and
cheerful responses to the barkings of his housed
companions
:
the guide, with rapid strides, having led them
through a small enclosure, advanced to the door, which
was an uncouth and shapeless opening, but little more
than a yard highand bidding them freely follow him,
he bent his tall form, and raising the deer skin mat that
secured it, he entered the forlorn mansionand as to
what adventures ensued therein, they are amply
narrated
in the succeeding section, which is devoted to the
purpose.

A NIGHT IN A RUINED WIGWAM.
When the travellers glanced their eyes around the
interior of the hovel, the shelter of whose roof they
had now attained, they felt that the wigwam presented
to their anxious sight, as bare and rude an appearance as
its outer aspect: the fire was raised in the centre of the
building, which was without a floor or pavement of any
kindand the blazing logs and fallen firebrands, were
only kept together by stakes driven into the ground at
the four angles, within whose ample bounds the fuel had
been laid: the flames, fed with dried brushwood, sent
up merrily their bright and brilliant gleams, as though
contending and mingling with the black column of smoke
which curled aloft, as one exulting in the prospect of
freedom, towards a circular hole in the top of the
cabin, and through the opening of which, in dusky
masses
,
it rushed tumultuously out unto the atmosphereor
like stragglers from a charging force, scattered in broken
clouds, just as it reached the goal of egressand then it
went floating and waving like plumes upon a hearse,
that mock death with pomp, along the dark edges of
the beams and rafters, which upheld the feeble and
miserable
roof, seeking flight in every aperture, and eddying
in every nook, like sable folds of tapestry stirred by the
wind: there was neither window nor space, left
ostensibly
for the admittance of air, which nevertheless
passed
with the velocity of a bird, in innumerable currents,
that swept fiercely over the bickering blaze, bending its
forky and shooting tongues like a young and tender tree,
finding its entrance through the numerous crannies and
vacancies in the crumbling walls, and other less
distinguishable
crevices of the decayed tenement: there were
doors to the dwelling, both equally uncouth and
misshapen
the
one by which the party had received
admission
,
and which looked towards the south, and the
other exactly opposite, on the northern side of the hut
each of the like dimension, and carefully closed from the
weather,but what principally engaged the attention of
the travellers, fatigued and feeble with toil and weakness
as they were, was the persons that occupied the wigwam
for reclined on various mats, of strange and savage forms
and texture, which were outspread around the fire, and
close to its heat were eight men, dissimilar in habit, and
forbidding in countenance. It was a minute and more,
ere the vision of our travellers could pierce the torchless
fog around them, which was scarce relieved by the
lanthorn
borne by their conductor, so as clearly to
distinguish
the bearing of those in whose company they were
thrownof but one, the garb corresponded with the
hunter, or was in the least resemblance to him whom
they had encountered in the forest: the attire of the
others, were motley and diversified as their complexion;
for although the darkened hues of toil and danger
predominated
on their stern visages, there was seen among
these few men, the yellow locks of the Europeanthe
black brow of the settler of the tropical isles, and the
curled hair and broad flat features of the dusky African:
there was, however, somewhat of a slight uniformity
in one particular, in which five of this group
assimilated
;
in the midst of the wild mixture of which their
dress partook, there was that which savoured the
following
of the sea, rather than the peaceful pursuit of
the chase; and indeed, save one, who from his mantle
and straps, coarse hood and wallet, had much the look
of some itinerant traderall the rest appeared armed
to the very teeth, not as men bent on healthful exercise
and lawful occupation, but as fearful of hazard, and
prepared
for desperate encounters and resistance: in their
appearance alone, there was something likely to create
alarm and distrust to the eye, and unfavourable
impression
to the mind, of those who viewed them: several
had their musquetoons resting on their kneesthe
pistolets
of others bristled in their belts at the side of a long
knife, or naked dagger, which was peculiar to the times,
and of the shape of that which is termed by the
Spaniards
of the main,
machete;
added to these was seated on
the ground, with his elbow resting on his knee, smoking
a pipe whose stem was of cane carved and painted, a
man whose deep olive complexion and beardless lip,
proclaimed the aboriginal origin and race from whom he
sprunghis garments and looks were barbarous in the
extremea blanket of many curious dies, was girt about
his waist by strings of leather, and thrown loosely like a
mantle, over his shoulders; he also wore a sort of
trowsers
,
or rather leggins, likewise of blanket, laced tightly
with deer gut, and on his feet were mocassins made of
moose hide; his face and breast, the latter of which,
was naked and uncovered, were scored by numerous
hideous streaks, and wild, fantastic and rude cut figures,
in paint of a reddish hue, through which, nevertheless,
often his natural swarthy colour could be easily
discerned
;
a bare and narrow pointed knife, hung by a string
from his neck, and there depended on his back, a pouch
of bison horn, which probably contained either his
powder
or tobaccoglittering bracelets of silver, were
fastened
about his wrist, and on his breast, rested a gorget
of copper; pendants of beautiful and varied beads,
were affixed not only to his ears, the gristle of which
was split nearly round, and hung with ornaments in
the form of some unknown bird or beast of the
wilderness
,
but also to his nose, which was bored through for
the purpose; his head was shaven of hair, except of one
long, lank, coal black tuft, that fell down his back
sweeping the very earth on which he sat; and was
tastefully
divided into several parcels and twisted strings,
each of which was stiffened and intermingled with divers
shining beads of a cylindrical shape, and curious
feathers of different hues, the whole being clubbed,
wound, and connected together, in one strange mass;
there were strings of wampum, made of white and black
shells, artfully mingled and interwoven in his belt collar
and blanket; a tomahawk was carelessly stuck in his
girdle, and at his side also, like to his companions, was
laid a musquetoonand lastly, close by the fire, stood a
boy of lithe and slender stature, scantily and barely
habited
in a cloak and doublet, tattered and worn nearly
to the woof, so that it appeared scarcely to protect him
from the cold, from which he seemed to suffer severely,
as he shiveringly drooped over a living bed of coals,
tending the slow progress of several steaks of venison
that were broiling thereon, yet reeking from the
slaughtered
body of a grey and noble buck, whose
bloodstained
carcass was cast stiff and stark with death, in a
recess
of the hovelthe remote and farther portions of
which, were scarce discerned by the most searching eye,
although here and there in its distant corners, undefined
and formless masses were eked out in rude and strange
shapes and heaps, to the ever busy and wild paintings
and imaginings of fancy. The quick and eager hum of
voice and conversation, which had loudly sounded in
mingled confusion, at the entrance of the wayworn
travellers
,
was suddenly stilled in silence as they advanced
and were perceived: two or three of the men hastily
started from their recumbent postures, and stared
rudely
at those, whom possibly they considered as intruders,
and then turned and whisperingly discoursed with their
companions, gazing alternately with sharp and fierce
glances, which betokened in appearance violence, rather
than good will or welcome; and the intention borne by
their countenances, seemed only dubious of action and
restraint for the momentwhile at the same time, as if
partaking of the savage and inhospitable feelings of
their masters, two grim, gaunt hounds, gnashing their
tusks, sprang crossly from where they were couching,
towards the approachersbut awed by the well-known
and stern tone of the guide who led the party, the
ferocious
animals sank their heads and paused,
disappointed
and growling, midway in their career: of all, the
Indian
alone was apparently most unmovedfor merely
turning his eyes for an instant, as the noise caused by
their advance in the hut met his hearing, with a slow
and listless movement, (which nevertheless, like the
flashing
of the fire-fly's wings, reflected brightly to the blaze
near which he sat, his sparkling and trembling ornaments,)
he resumed his first attitude, with an air of total
unconcern
,
indifference and abstraction, which appeared
impenetrable
and unaffected, by the event of the passing
moment.
The hunter now hastily singled out from this
assemblage
,
a slender made man of diminutive height, with
sharp pointed features, that had a peculiar expression
which conveyed to the remarker, feelings of an
indefinite
cast, that left predominant an impression dubious as
to the character he might bear in life, yet certainly
unfavourable
as to his temperfor he bore that strongly
marked and bitter frown on his brow, that bespoke
passion
uncontrolled and unrestrainedviolent anger, that
would outleap discretion's bounds, and leagued with
unpitying
hate, war even to the death: and there were with
these, many and deep furrows ploughed in his
forehead
,
wrought by the power of stern and darksome
thoughtwhile, withal, there was in his manner and
movements, something that betokened an acquaintance
with the courteous rules of the world, somewhat above
the sphere in which he was acting, and beyond the rude
and offensive bearing of his companions,for although a
surly scowl, at first had contracted his sallow visage as
he viewed the persons who had entered within the
wigwam
,
to a look of ferocity, that spoke as it were of joy
or triumph, such as when the foul falcon, loosed from its
confining jesses, soars aloft and singles its prey,
stretching
its blood-thirsty beak in pursuityet having briefly
exchanged a few words with their conductor, but in so low
a tone that they reached not the anxious ears of the
travellers, while from the significant glances and
gestures
that passed, they were led to believe he was
detailing
their destitute situation, this personage, after a
moment's hesitation, in which he probably was
determining
on the course to pursue, came forward as principal
of those present, and greeted the wanderers who had
thus been thrown on his hospitality, in a voice of
kindness
.
Certes, the personal appearance of this man,
differed
as much from the savage looking attendants who
surrounded him, as did the elevation of his carriageand
savoured a little of the authority which he evidently
exercised over this wild and singular company, whose
muscular and athletic figures, might have vied with the
banditti of the Apulia, which the captive Salvator Rosa
loved so well to paint; his jerkin was gaudily and
profusely
trimmed with tarnished lace,thrown negligently
over his shoulder, he wore a cloak whose colours had
once been of the gayest court huebut frequent
exposure
to the weather, had dimmed and faded it, equally
with the embroidery, that seamed in what once had been
richness, the other portions of his dress; on his head,
he had a small cocked hat, ornamented with deep gold
fringe, with a long Spanish plume drooping downwards;
a belt about his waist girt a small hanger and a pair of
pistolets.
It is needless for me to speak that you are welcome,
cavaliers, when your wants claim such assistance, said
he, tempering a countenance not ill favouredthough
every line roughened by the fatigue and endurance of
storms, as well as by habitual indulgence of the
coarsest
passions, by the 'stress we have known ourselves,
we are ready to divide our tortunesyou is a brave
beast we have slain, and the mess is large enough to
spare a part.
And yet as he spoke, the younger traveller deemed
that there flashed on him a sinister glance of peculiar
and daring inquiry, from the small grey eye of the host,
that was not only irksome, but threatening to him on
whom it turned, and almost belied the free and generous
reception which he was striving to extend by words.
Room was now made at the firethan which, a more
pleasant sight could not have been offered to the frozen
and wearied frames of the rescued travellersand as
their hosts heaped fresh wood on the flames, through
which the forky blaze mounted, licking the sides of the
branches it destroyed, like the darting adderevery nerve
of their outworn bodies, felt the grateful return of
strength: the genial and friendly heat, seemed almost
to renew the very sources of life, which had nearly
been extinctand the blood flew freely in its
accustomed
currents in their veinsyet the cold, as it
retreated
from their flesh, left an agony inscrutable; every
bone seemed to tingle and smart, as pierced by a
thousand
thorns; but slowly the pain and anguish that thus
severely rent them, departed; and from their escape,
they laboured under no detriment except weakness,
while the past terrors of the elements, which had so
nigh been fatal, grew as it were a dream; for such is
life, one hour after the deadliest pass that we have
thrided
,
even with narrow warding of breath or limbit
seemeth but a visiona thing to be remembered as
having
known, but whose agonies, which, while passing, was
scarce to be enduredbut after, grow faint in
recollection
,
and is only thought on as sickness in the fairest
hour of health, or as the past storm to the mariner in
safety
,
whose dangers cannot deter from new adventure:
Vol. I. 19
but nevertheless, though guarded from the immediate
and pressing ill, that had so late overhung them with
death, by the unlooked for obtainment of shelter, the
mind of the younger traveller was but little at ease; for
many and painful were the feelings that rushed upon
him, and distressful to his enjoyment of that rest, of
which both his body and mind stood in so much need
he was a stranger in the landthe service imposed on
his bearing, was of the most important naturesuch,
that in the present convulsed state of the king's colony
of New-Yorke, while the spirit of the time raged at its
height, in even a country so desolate and uncivilized
should it be known to a foe, and who were such, he had
scarce the means to distinguish, it might cost his life
but that was not in his thought so much, as the failure of
the business, which to his country, to him, was of the
utmost moment; and still, well was he aware that the
wild and outlawed, the lawless and blood-thirsty, roamed
at large and unrestrained; for he was in the land of the
savage red menand of the white, more barbarous than
these; here the pirate, in defiance of the world, made
his homeand many were the desperate convicts, who
had been sent to till the earth, and pierce this
wilderness
,
when their deeds of crime had cast them from
their native landa pathless, unknown and interminable
desert, was around, the lair of the most destructive
animals
,
or of human creatures more untamed; and with
these he was now matedthere was that which fed
suspicion
cherishing
and adding to fear, rather than
diminishing
,
the more he viewed themthe fierce looks,
the rude and daring glances, the familiar and singular
manner of him who appeared superior, were all
calculated
to inspire disgust and secret foreboding, rather than
ease and confidence; and the observer as he gazed, was
conscious of an involuntary shudder that crept upon
him: and when his eye ran over the remote, indistinct
and smoky recesses of the wigwam, from which, in case
it should prove that he was betrayed in hostile hands,
he saw no escape living, save at the will of his
entertainers
.
From such painful reflections, he was shortly aroused
by the serving of food, which at a signal, was placed
before the assemblage by the boy, to whom was given
the most servile duties; he fulfilled them with a stupid
and nervous air, that called forth frequent and vociferous
reproofs and curses, from the savages on whom he
tended
and
once or twice, the attention was drawn to the
helpless creature, by blows, which for some slight
negligence
,
he received from his brutal mastersand which
he bore in sullen silenceindeed so vacant and lustreless
was the gaze, and the careless patience with which he
endured
this ill treatment, as to lead to a supposition that
his intellect was injured by long, harsh usagefor his
features, which, though thin and pale, seemed naturally
handsome and delicate, were distorted by an unsettled
and simple expression, that savoured of idiocywhich,
though not confirmed on inquiry, still it was learnt that
the unfortunate youth was destitute in nearly an equal
degree, being totally deprived of the faculty of hearing.
The lousy dog, said the person who has been
designated
as the principal of the group, maketh no lie
of the old sawfor he that is born to wear a hempen
necklace, never drank death from salt water: you must
see, my masters, that we, that's you hard faced knaves,
and myselfthof we are sporting ashore now, with these
lubbers of the land, follow old ocean from our choice;
well, it so chanced that the balindra, that I commanded
some two years since, was laid aboard in the very stream
of the gulf, by a terrific blow, through which the
oldest seaman scarce hoped to see her liveby my soul,
the waves rolled down upon us, as thof the clouds were
fallingthe wind piped shrill along the shrouds, with
voice that woke despairand on the angry deep the
bark fluttered like a dying bird.
By the beard of Rubens, what a picture it would
have madeI vow by my halidome, I would have given
a year's life to have been there, to catch the subjecta

Stoll, broke out the ensign, catching fire from the idea.
Well sirs, continued the narrator, scarce heeding
the interruption, morning came at lastwe had
weathered
the gale, thof shattered and mastless; not so it
seems did another vessel, who, ere the sun went down,
lay to our windwardbut of which, at day-break, there
was no vestigeyet as we lay too, repairing, there came
floating by, that which might once have been a goodly
spar, but then so splinted and broken that it scarce
buoyed from death a shapeless creature, that hung to it
as an infant to its motherwe fished it up, and saved the
springal, who, with his sullen humours and useless ear,
but ill repays the trouble of his rescue.
By the pencil of Sir Godfrey, exclaimed the
soldier
,

loose, careless, masterly manner, of his headhair

specimenan excellent companion to the gipsy boy by
Kneller, on my faithhe's in a fine positionit wont do

immortalize
you in my fuelle.
So saying, the eager amateur drew forth his tablets
and crayons, and in spite of his situation, weariness, and
that which he had encountered, in a minute, forgetful of all
about him, and wrapt in his employment, so that he
remarked
not the frown of his comrade, he was as busily
engaged as if his very existence depended on the
accuracy
of his delineation.
The fare, though coarse and ill cooked, fatigue and
hunger that accompanied, rendered palatableit was
roughly placed on wooden vessels of Indian make, which
might probably have been left by the last inhabitant of
the wigwam; and they were forced to carve with knives
and dirks, which they took from their belts. When the
meal was finished, to the surprise of the travellers, a
keg of spirits was rolled forward, and each one as he
chose, helped himself with large and eager draughts of
the potent liquid. Until now, there had been an
unwilling
and somewhat constrained intercourse, and but few
interchange
of words, with most of this party and their
guestswhich had been felt by the latter, as peculiarly
unencouraging and alarming, to men in their destitute
condition; but as the cup passed freely one to another,
much of the cold and forbidding manners of the hosts,
departed
beneath its influence: they no longer spoke apart
in low tones, nor gazed with ireful and audacious eyes, at
the persons who had entered their circle, possibly against
their will; while soon the gay wassail reigned of such
whose days are spent in hardy toil, and to whom each
enjoyment is more cheerful and precious, as it is seldom
and brief. The savage alone was silent, and seemed
from the first, to hold little or no conversation with the
rest; he ate and drank apart unnoticed by his
companions
,
who showed indeed no disposition to disturb
him. The liquor was copiously used and quaffed
almost undiluted, yet it appeared to have but a transient
effect on the hardened frames of the drinkers, and
although
the coarse joke and unrestrained burst of
merriment
made the very building ring, yet little else than what
fell from the lips of the person who has been mentioned as
appearing a superior, could be gathered by the younger
traveller, as to the character of the entertainersyet
there were some things that graved suspicions and
contradicted
the account he had giventhere was an
acquaintance
with the hutthere were stores and conveniencies
which it afforded, that led unconsciously to the belief that it
was not the temporary shelter represented, but that the same
persons had assembled at an appointed meeting, beneath
its roof before: and then their language and discourse,
though doubtful and ambiguous, was too often garnished
with vile obscenity and horrid execrations, and larded
with dark and obscure phrases, which were eked forth
with too significant, though to the observer,
unintelligible
gestures, not to impress with unfavourable
sentiments
and
truly, as the strong, broad red light of the
fire, with its irregular splendour glared duskily on the
swarthy, uncouth, savage, and storm beaten visages of
those who crowded round it, throwing its vivid lustre on
portions of the desperate looking features, and rendering
harsher the rough lines of countenance, as they were
19*
backed by the strong and gloomy shades of the
apartment
,
all forcibly struck the alarmed and startled
imagination
of the guest, as if he looked on a darksome
crowd of demons, carousing in their midnight and
subterraneous
vault, or on a troop of evil spirits, as they flitted
rejoicingly about the furnace of the cabalist.
Another subject on my troth, said the delighted Jost
Stoll, as he chanced to glance his eye around him, what
a fortunate artist I amas sure as I kissed the hand of
his sacred majesty, this is a group that beats all Salvator
ever paintedI must not lose this opportunitygive me
nature before your copyists. By my halidome! what
lights, what shadows are heredivine art I thank thee
for this enjoyment.
On the side of the fire, opposite to where the younger
traveller was placed, sat, however, a man over whom the
liquor was now fast gaining a triumph, and going far to
remove
the caution with which his comrades evidently
governed. From the long, repeated, and unsparing
potations
which he had swallowed, he was already at that stage
of inebriation when the mind, unsettled and wayward, flies
from one thing to another, and if in the least opposed in
its wild career, becomes displeased, and the tongue noisy
and quarrelsome with every thing it meets to vent itself
on. The person of this man, though somewhat bloated,
was muscular, bony, and square made, and being a little
undersized, he apparently joined that bodily activity and
sinew which combines such prodigious advantage in close
conflict; his face was naturally unprepossessing, sunburnt
and freckled, while numerous blotches and reddish streaks
about his cheeks and nostrils, proclaimed his propensity
to debauchery; long grizzled and projecting eyebrows
overhung like a beetling rock his small sharp grey eyes,
the expression of which was extremely inauspicious; his
hair and mustachios were of a deep red cast; he was clad
in a long jerkin of brown cloth, and doublet of the same
material, about his waist was a buff belt, in which were
placed numerous weapons of violencehe had been for
some time engaged in earnest discourse with the only
peaceable looking and unarmed man of the party, who
has been mentioned above, and who was reclining on a
mat next to him; heretofore the words that had passed
between
them were uttered so low as only to be heard by
him to whom they were addressed; but at this period the
drunken ruffian attracted the notice of all by the sound of
a voice as disagreeable as his physiognomy, and whose
screech-owl notes were heard above the loudest of the
others, like the voice of the tempest above the waves of
the sea.
The foul fiend give thee his benison, said he, you
make yourself as much at home as you were in your hole
by Cherry Garden; curse thee, an hast treated me as in
the last voyagedo you hear what I say? that is, if the
pieces lack weight; that is, if they are some o' you're
damn clipper's coindo you mind me? I'll capsize your
fleshless carcass like a shallop in the trough of the sea.
On the word of an honest man, returned the other,
who had a face like an adze, and a voice that shrunk in
his throat to a groan, with awe of the person he addressed,
and at the same time that he spoke he edged himself
away from his disagreeable neighbour, may I never be
a fence to a highbinder again, an I ha' not fairly done by
thee. I ha' been in the trade this eighteen years and
upwards, and in my worse times ha' been an honest man
I've a character to lose; my reputation all know is, in
the way of business, irreproachableI ha' ne'er yet cut
the quidno, on my honour, thou hast not one sop o'
cogniac in the boottleI'll take my oath at assize, before
my friend Dirk Von Rikkettee, an you like, that I ha'
done right by thee.
The devil rot you, skinflint, cried the first, I'll stake
a bowl of bomboo that you have wronged me, sin you swear
contraryhowsomever, I'll take a drink firstfor you
are a damn'd rogue, you know you are; you always
douse helm when you should not, and thof you may talk
it wellwhat's your palaver worth? not a rope yarn, for
don't I know you? you are as great a picaroon on land
as the old man is on the oceanyou know who I
mean.
And jerking up one shoulder, he gave a meaning leer
with his eyes, throwing them on one side towards the
direction where the principal of the party stood. A
hearty laugh from most of the company followed, but a
deep frown darkened the face of the superior.
Come, boys, said he, you have forgotten our
agreement
.
Gabriel, these matters are such as it would be
proper for you to defer talking on; there are more fitting
places and times.
Damn it, an't we ashore? replied the man, whose
intemperance had overcome whatever obedience he at
other times possessed, now or never I'll make him
settle
there's
no bamboozling Gabriel Loffe; who knows
but the knave to-morrow may dance with a halter for his
cravat, and leave his debts to be collected; no curse it,
the ghost of Tom More, captain, shall not hinder me from
getting what he owes me.
Rascal! another word like that
You need not look so squally on me, continued
Loffe in a surly tone, the dogged obstinacy of his nature
increased by drinking, I am one, you know, that always
speaks my mind; none of your skulking under hatches
for me:I am sworn by the bread and the wineand I
am bold to say, thof you are master aboard there, there's
not rover's law, but you've an equal in a swabber ashore.
And do you see now, you need not think I'm drunkI
can tell when a man calls me rascal, an he means offence
so I am one that says, if the cord will fit a man's neck
he should not disdain to have it tiedthof damme, I
have sailed the sea since staunch old Morgan burnt the
rancharias, at Panama, and there never was the breeze
that blew me a rascal from man's mouth, unless he felt
the point of a handspikerascal! the lubber who makes
so free with dirty colours, mostly fights under his own
flagI a'nt drunk when I say that, curse me!
Dog! do you dare mutiny and shouted the other,
while his cheek glowed with ire, and his brows met as he
fixed his eye sternly on the insolent ruffian, while at the
same time he hurridly thrust his right hand towards the
handle of his pistolet, leaving his speech unfinished with
a sudden and startling pause, drawing in his lips, which
were blanched to an ashen hue, so that his teeth were
shown set strongly together as in deadly rage, thy life,
thy heart's blood, dog.
Yet, however, ere he could pursue the action implied,
the event of which would have probably from
appearances
proved bloody and fatal, one of the party who was
wrapped in a dark sea cloak and had been silently
viewing
the passing scene, abruptly started from the mat on
which he lay, and rising in an instant to his feet with a
quick, true, and nervous blow felled the savage Loffe
like a log to the earth.
Lie you there, knave as you are, exclaimed the
conqueror
,
until the padre gives you un bula de defunctos,
for your peccadilloes. Santo Espiritu, learn, thou stupid
buey, to keep thy mouth close as a caulked deck, nor
hoist sail thus at random withouten compass or rudder.
Loffe, though borne down by the power of his
antagonist's
arm, was merely stunned for a momenthe rose
again immediately, like the wounded tiger lashed with the
strength of fury; the blow had sobered him, and as he
felt the warm blood rush in a current from his head and
trickle down his face, his every limb trembled with
revenge
and hatehis hand flew to his belt, and the bared
blade of the long knife shone in the light of the fire as he
flourished it before him.
Comrades, messmates, roared he in a voice of
thunder
,
while his eyes glared with the frenzy of a demoniac,
will you keep to the leeward, and let me be murdered
like our gunnercurse it, we can take 'vantage of the
king's proclamation, so he that's a man let him show his
steel, and win Bass' golden Jacobuses.
Two or three only ranged at his side, and grasped
their hangers with dark and gloomy visagesthe others
sternly clenched their long and glittering cutlasses or
raised the deadly musquetoon, and awaited the superior's
commands. There was a brief and fearful pause, which,
however, was broken by the master's darting between
the adverse parties, and seizing the mutineer by the
throat with the grasp of a lion, while he levelled the
weapon he hastily snatched from his girdle at his head.
By God! he cried, in a loud tone, he that makes
the least advance in this brawl, shall roll a corse at my
feet. Why this is serpent-likehave I not glutted ye
with gold, and would ye devour me? Sooth, ye are brave
sparks! put up your arms, dare to disobey, and may my
soul broil in hell but I will feed on the heart of him that
refusesand thou, villain, foul-faithed slave, that would
bite the hand that feeds thee, an thou darest longer
grumble
or threaten one word of treachery, damn thee, sot, be
ye in liquor or not, thy brains shall be as water beneath
my heel, which thus will I trample on.
He flung the heavy frame of the brutal Loffe from him,
while either awed by his determined manner, or moved
by a sense of returning duty, scarce had he finished
speaking, ere, with one accord, every offensive weapon
was silently returned to its place by the rest; however,
over the countenance of the ringleader, a malignant look,
that betokened his spirit still unquelled and ready to
brave the worst to satisfy revenge, yet remained; but
no one appeared to second him, so contending with his
feelings, as far as not to renew the contest on such
unequal
grounds, with a slow step and in sullen silence he
withdrew himself to the darkest part of the wigwam,
where, having thrown himself on the earth, his
discontented
and heated mind brooded over its imaginary
wrongs.
It was astonishing how quick all was tranquillized;
scarce a minute passed and no trace of quarrel remained;
those who but a while before had thirsted for each other's
gore, and who with scornful eye had exchanged ireful
looks of mortal hatred, and the stern defiance of deadly
war, were again calmly sitting side by side, and drank
from the same cup like brethren in love. The broil had
died away like a thought, and was forgotten; the master
alone deemed it necessary to make some explanation to
the travellers for passages which had evidently alarmed
them; Jost Stoll had paused in his pursuit, and stood up
with one hand holding his tablets, and the other placed
on the hilt of his sword, as about to rush in the fray and
part the combatants; his comrade had also taken to the
last movement, but started in anxious suspense on the
words that fell from the lips of the engaged parties; the
master had observed this, and he was sensible the unruly
conduct of his wild associates was fast rendering abortive
his designs.
We are a mad, strange set of fellows, said he, but
cavaliers, you will not think the worse of it, if you have
marked as much of mankind as I have; the hand that
is nearest the steel grasps the warmer from the heart
I hate the man who knows no change like Hecla's snow,
butby hell this is not the first time the drunken brute
hath wrought disturbance, and let him beware, he raised
his voice lest he tempt mine anger once too oftenyou
see, sirs, how needful for a man who would command that
he forget his nature even to tyranny. I do regret it, yet
else, these wretches would tread me to dust; sooth. I
wonder not the best have forgot in such a state their
meekness, for where is the man who could gaze on
treason
open-eyed and let it destroy him, no, the breath of
mutiny should be stilled in death, and may my soul fry in
hell-fire, if on such provocation, I refrain from the
extent.
By my halidome, interrupted Stoll, with his usual
quickness and lack of caution, it runneth in my mind
your argument is erroneous; by the bye a painting of a
duello
or single fight might do very well, though there would
be a want of figures, yet that might be supplied in scenery;
but natheless, master, although I am a soldier, and have
seen blood, I cannot agree with you that a mutineer should
be slain unless after fair trial, and I just think me of a
case exact in point: there's that rascal Kid, the rover,
against whom the statute of outlawry is in force: I have
no dubitation, that were he once in the purlieus of
Newgate, that the murders committed against his
comrades
would weigh as much at Old Bailey to get him a
Tyburn blessing, an the worst of his piracies, bad as they
are.
During this dissertation of the ensign, the sallow visage
of the person whom he addressed, underwent various
changes; at the first, he turned peevishly and hastily
from the speaker, while his lip curled with
contemptuous
impatience, and his brows gathered darkly: ere,
however, Stoll had ended, his attention became attracted,
and he gazed on him with a look, suddenly, as though he
would have read the very soul of the soldier; but
apparently
,
his curiosity found but little satisfaction to
requite
that which had aroused itfor in an instant after,
as though being conscious of having betrayed some
weakness, he withdrew his eye, and walked slowly
backwards
and forwards through the hovel.
Santa Madre, si Senor, said the seaman, beneath
whose prowess Loffe had fallen, while a smile of
singular
expression lurked about the corners of his mouth,
that's to say, d'ye see, I am under the same tack in that
wind as you areCielo!'tis hard smothering a man
in his own hammockfor the houndKid I meanthis
is between decks, winking humorously as great a
scoundrel
as he may be, hath those on this side of the water,
seeing as how you are from abroad, and an't like to
know these thingsthat wish him fair seas and a ballast
of gold and silverbut as for me, carra! I would sort
the perro a round dozen a-day, from his own cat well
laid on amidships, and damme, if that does not sink a
man, his sky scraper will always swim above water.
But the old hunks would'nt be so bad either, did he
not sing long Ben Bridgeman's song to his crew,forty shares
of booty to his own locker, and damned a peeling of the
cable to his men muttered a coarse and swarthy faced
man, with a loud, gruff voice, that sounded like the notes
of a dying bear.
Grant ye, David Mullinsgrant you, he is of the
true fox breed; while he takes venison, hide and tallow,
he cares not how his followers quarrel for the ten
branchings of the antlers, responded one in the dress
of a hunter.
Ay, the old boy's commission is a broad onethere's
not a ferret hawker that has cruised about Cape
Cormorin
,
that knows the weight of a piece of Arabian gold like
him, said another.
Nor is there a cutter, but he can bilk him with
damaged muslins and romels from Cutshean, joined in
the smooth, lean personage, who had been Loffe's first
adversary.
The master stopped abruptly in his walk, and gazed
on the speakers, By Godthis is Judas like, he spoke
in a low tone, that became more pointed and bitter as he
proceeded, and rolled to the startled ear, like thunder
while distantwhen the cur hath his bone to lick,
should he growl? should the slave refuse to how the
knee to him who gives him bread? dare the groveling
ground worm writhe against the heel that spares its
miserable
existence? dogs! what are ye? was it not for
meon my soul it doth amuse one, to see the forked
tongue of the snake spit out venom against the bosom
that cherished ithis dark eyes dilated, and his words
swelled with the deep energy of stifled passionyet
recollection
of a sudden, moved him, and he withdrew his
extended arm, and relaxed the strong clenching of his
hand, and looking more calmly around, he turned to the
travellers sooth, it wearies my patience, he
continued
,
to see grown men act thus the ways of
childhood
.
Sirs, ye have prudence, and can well deem how
rash these light, ill judged sayings, come from the mouths
of marinersmen whose lives are of the seawhose
very breath is at the risk of storm and steeland ye
know we cannot have more caution than is wantedfor
who marks what ear listens? there are many of us here,
strangers, asking your pardonyonder forester, too, a
few hours since we knew not, and we have met and joined
company in his native woodsand there is a sad warning
in the tale that's abroadye have doubtless heard it,
how Kid tricked the Dutchman off Bonavisthe thick
headed fool in a possada at the Madeiras, had reviled the
free trader, scarce believing who was nearso by God,
when he took him, he reckoned scores on his hide; the
rover hoisted the boaster and his crewran them up
the main yard by the arms, and then burnt their vessel
Vol. I. 20
to the water's edge;
[45]
[45]
Vide Kid's Trial, where there is not only a repetition of
many of his acts of cruelty, but also there will be found many of
the terrific expressions which he was accustomed to use in his
violent
fits of passion, and which are here rather softened down than
heightened.
and may my soul be damned, if he
served them not rightlywhat say you, ha?
He broke off, and glanced his eyes around with a stern
and savage look, while his lawless looking followers,
stricken as with awe, answered not a word in return, but
gazed silently in each other's faces as men who have
fearlessly, rashly, and unaware of the danger, strolled
beneath
the sparkling base of an avalanche, and behold it
tottering above them, ready to crush with death at the
slightest whisper even of their fears; and each recoiled
from the anger that had been roused, like the bold skater
of the north, who in confidence and hardihood, braves the
fast rotting bosom of the ice, that binds the cold visage of
some wintry stream, and hears the hollow creak and
groan of the frail crystal that upholds him, which seems
parting asunder as he glides:a pause followed, the
Indian raised his head with a slow action, and bending
his body gracefully after his wild fashion of address, as the
noble top of some verdant tree, stirred to motion by the
gentle southern breeze that wantons in the living forest,
he spoke
Yonnondio,
A word of respect used by the Indians of the Five Nations in
addressing a white warrior.

Skinned
Beaver; my words fly to reach your ear. Listen
Yonnondio, Areouski hath stricken with the red hatchet

I am a desolate man; the
Great Spirit only knows why I live, for I am like a blasted
hemlock; the winds of the tempest have bared the pride
of my branchesI am dead from the top; my generation,
my race hath gone bymy ancient fire is extinguished
but though my heart is sick, the rain of the black cloud
is not in my eyes; yet these are the deeds of a red man
his mouth was a snare, for the friendship of his lips was
as sweet as the sagamite, but the roots of his tongue were
bitterand now the ashes of my wigwam, and the bones
of my kin are blown towards the setting sun; his knife

as swift as the
flight of the red birdfor three days and three nights did
I follow in the blood-stained tracks of his retreat, with an
eye sharpened like the lynx, a foot like the deer, and an
arm like the great bear of the Apalachian hills, and the
last sun went down, while the wind howled over the
beaver
blanket of the Black Buffalo, and the desert wolf
sang his death song; his blood is not dry on my hatchet
Yonnondio, though the words of mine enemy hath stung
my ear to the quick with the bite of the rattlesnake, the
White Skinned Beaver had not sought his life, for such
madness is not the commands of the Great Spirit, but of
Kitchi Manitoubut he drank the blood of my name,
both sannup and squawyet white man, I rejoice not over
the body of my foe, for he died like a warrior. The
red man ceased and replaced the calumet to his lips.
By God! I doubt me but the heathen dog hath some
wit in his speech, said the master, after a minute's pause,
Indian, thou hast not spoken wrong; I feel it doth not
become, that is, it is going far to take life for a quick
word alonebut have I not been driven to it? continued
he, in a lower tone, as communing with himself and
disregarding
the presence of others, By God, I say, I
have been forced to do that which I have done; but it
matters not. I do not care so much for the death of my
gunner, as for other passages in my voyagefor I have
good friends in England who will bring me off.
The buccaneer (for such he was) measured a short
distance
with a pensive tread, as one buried in serious
thought, at last he fronted his guests. Our discourse
hath taken an over strange tack, said he, that may
not guile a wearisome man. Sirs, your stress hath,
craving
your mercy, been but sadly looked to; but Olyve
shall outlay your couchescoarse ones, forsooth, and
lacking little invitation to rest; but wot ye gentles, ye
are not in a lady's bower.
He made a hasty signal to the boy, who, laying on the
ground at a distance from his rude masters, seemed as
banquetting on a brief moment of ease, snatched from his
hard and servile toilings, he arose, when he caught the
master's eye; but approached sullen and discountented,
and as he conducted the travellers in pursuance to the
rover's directions, his step was unwilling and his
countenance
scowled with displeasure, and he appeared moved
with the angry feelings of petulent childhood in the
execution
of an unwelcome commandSullenly he flung a
few mats on the ground, and pointed to each his separate
place of rest.
A right soldier's bed this, comrade, as I live, quoth
Ensign Stoll, yet on my halidome, there never was a
picture in better keeping. Why now this wild pallet,
whereon I am about to stretch my aching bones, would
make as exquisite a model fordeath and the devil,
springald, what are you about?
The boy, who had been busied with apparently great
reluctance in assisting to adjust and gather the wide
flowing cloak of the soldier round his brawny shoulders,
ere he cast himself on the destined spot for his repose,
had at the moment of the exclamation unloosened the
leathern belt that supported the ensign's rapierwho as
he spoke beheld the weapon in the grasp of the
disobliging
urchin, who had undone the buckles, however, with
so sly and cautious an action, as scarce to be perceptible
to the wearer. The stripling was in some confusion,
whatever were his intentions in possessing himself of the
steel, when detected; but resuming confidence almost
instantly, he with an insolent motion and unchanging
countenance gave to understand that it appeared a
slight on the entertainers that the guests should
encumber
themselves with their armsand that if resigned to
him they should be well cared for.
We are vowed men, be where we may, to retain our
defence at hand, said the younger traveller
expressively
,
and at the same time putting back the arm of the
officious stripling, that had approached to the pistolets in
his girdle, that light blade will not inconvenience or
hinder my fellow here from one moment's reposeand
as for these barkers of mine, young friend, they were
polished
by Wynkyne of Hainault, an expert artisan, who
charged me with peculiar care of them.
The boy recoiled and disappointed gave back from the
soldier's touch; but not, however, without venting a
half formed sound of anger and spiteful rage, in which it
seemed as if nature contended against incapacity of
utterance, with a force nearly of masterywhile, as he
retired, as though to make up for words, a malicious and
threatening look clouded his visage, with a mischievous
and gloomy meaning, savouring of that wicked
gratification
and elvish glee with which one of the swart goblins
of German story, might have gloated on some sleeping
infant
,
ere with its bony and sinewy fingers it pressed the
life from the tender and unguarded throat of the
unconscious
child. The traveller marked the lurking devil of
the urchin's eyebut the gaze of the hosts was on them,
and he could but whisper unperceived a brief caution to
Jost Stoll not to close his sight, but which that worthy
scarce heeded, being thoroughly overpowered and
exhausted
;
for not a moment after he stretched his jaws
with a yawn to their utmost width, and having tossed and
tumbled about in vain, and seeming unconscious from
weariness, of comprehending his companion's suspicions,
he was fain soon to yield to a slumber deep and
overwhelming
,
the most decided tokens of which were
announced
by long and heavy breathings, whose music was
strengthened by certain variations or notes that wound
through his nostrils and sounded not unlike the long
winded drone with which some warlike moscheto sounds
his battle call about the face of the feverish sleeper, ere
he uses his hungry spear.
Although there was not a limb of the younger traveller
but what trembled with pain, and required all the
refreshening
succour that slumber could bestow for a renewal of
vigouryet so troubled, anxious, and awakened was his
20*
mind by the events that he had but a short period before
witnessed, together with the situation in which he was, at
the mercy of beings who to him appeared as tameless and
uncurbed by the ties of law or nature, as the waves they
were wont to ploughthat he forced himself to combat
against that now necessary indulgence of sleep, which
hung over him in very mockery, like the phantom waters
of the dry and parched desert, which flow with gentlest
ripple, that might lull the storm worn mariner, to the eye
of the eager and deceived pilgrim, who with high hopes
and renovated strength rushes to the shadowy shore to
bathe his heated brow and slake his burning thirstbut
finds sand alonescorching sand and bitter death: yea,
his pulse and temples throbbed with feverish and restless
anxiety, like the bull when worried and driven by the
javelins of the sportsman of the corrida del toros.
Indeed
,
the perils by which he was evidently encompassed,
were a sufficient cause of watchfulness; for however he
might at first have hesitated on the object and character
of his entertainers, momently every latent doubt
disappeared
,
and it was not possible to mark unmoved, the
disgusting mixture of impertinent curiosity, barefaced
hardihood
,
and ruffian surliness of the manner and
conversation
of these men; all was convincing in a bosom the
least prone by circumstance to suspicion: and now he
could not shut out the fearful reality that closed about
himwith a quick and ghastly eye he gazed upon the
stern and savage forms that moved in the red gleams
that shot in vividness from the fireand as the strong
light bronzed the hardy visages and gloomy brows of
those who ministered in its radiance, a hundred accidents
rendered certain the truth of his fearful and desperate
fancies. The rumour had ran abroad that the blood
stained pirate, the rover Kid, was in a distant sea; in
that confidence he had landedbut now the thought was
blighting and searing as a blast of death, and yet he
could not banish itfor there was the motlied garbthe
deep swarthy and sunburnt hue of countenancethe
wild reverly and reckless riot that were ascribed to the
free trader and his followersand then for him there
was no escape. A thousand times better, he mentally
acknowledged, had he died, perished, and now lay a
frozen stark corpse in the snow, than thus to drain to the
dregs the bitterness of despair, and await the descending
sword which by a single hair hung above him, like that
which dropped o'er the head of the luxurious Syracusan.
Were it possible, thought he, to destroy these
papers, could I effect that, my own blood were scarce
worth avenging. He thrust his hand in his bosom, and
shot a quick glance around the dusky hovelthe view
was cheerless and without comfortthe ideathe wish,
that prompted the act, was as false and fatal, as that
which urges the spirit of the wicked Moslemite, to rise
at the call of the two angels that wait upon the
sepulchre
,
and forswear his faithfor darkness like death,
came o'er his heart, as his sight drank in the scene; he
gazed sadly on the black and rugged wallsthey were
as chains to bind him prisoner in the uttermost moment
of dangerhis heart sankand when his eye rested on
the tall figures that stalked like giant shadows before
him, his imagination became excited, and wandered as in
a feverish dream; and he could scarce refrain from
believing
,
that as he looked on them, their forms distended
and enlarged, and their features grew sternerand that
every glance they threw towards him, was savage, and
threatening murther; his hand quitted the vellum, and
slid with involuntary haste to the haft of his sword
There is no chance against such fearful odds, said he
to himself firmly, if I have fallen in the snare they've
set, at least I will die as a man: some few of these dogs
shall never read the neck verse, if my arm weakens not
in the encounter, and this good steel serves me as wont.
There is a fascination, that at the trying hours of men's
lives, seizes as with a grasp of fate upon their intellect
they are deadthey become powerless, and watch
without
a care, to evade the instrument of destruction that
creeps gradually from its concealment, in their view,
fluttering in the toil like the simple tranced bird, which
hovers over the basilisk serpent, as bound by strings of
iron to its destroyereven so the younger traveller, lay
with ear painfully acute to the stirring of the slightest
breath within the wigwam, while often such was the
intense anxiety of his mind, that cold beads of dew hung
on his forehead, starting as if they were drops of blood
gathered from his veins;with what a bursting vision,
must the defenceless victim, bound in the embrace of the
brazen and crowned idol of those accursed vallies,
Tophet
[47]
[47]
Some imagine Tophet to have been the butchery, or place of
slaughter, at Jerusalem, lying to the south of the city, in the valley
of the children of
Hinnom
, and where, it is also said, that a
constant
fire was kept for burning the carcasses and other filth, that
was brought out of the city; there it was also, they cast the ashes
and remains of their false gods, when they demolished their altars
and broke down their statues; others say it was where they
offered
to the god
Moloch
with beat of drum; the statue of
Moloch
was brass, hollow within, with its arms extended, and stooping a
little forward: they lighted a great fire within the statue, and
another
before it; they put the person intended to be sacrificed upon
one of its arms, which soon fell down into the fire at the foot of the
statue, while the victim's shrieks and cries were drowned by the
rattling of drums, and the sound of other musical instruments.
and Hinnom, have drank in the horrid
preparations
of the bloody priests and sacrificersthe
tumultuous
cries about himthe shrieks of the mad
worshippers
the
riotous sounding of tymbal, sackbut, or
psaltery
,
could not for a second have withdrawn his fixed
attention
,
or aroused him from the misery of his situation;
and so, though the younger traveller dropped his heavy
lids o'er their blood-shot balls, to give them an instant's
ease, and to collect his energy for the emergence which
he deemed was nighyet it struck him as if in that short
time, every machination which was to be dreaded, had
been compassedand immediately he turned the
disturbed
orbs with quick strained sense upon those he had so
briefly closed them on; his sight came unware upon a
near, and that which had awhile been an unnoted object;
his glance met in its wild sweep an answerbut not of
sympathy, as it seemed to him, but adding to alarmfor,
seated idly a few paces distant from his rude mat, was
the attendant boy, with looks bent intently on the agitated
traveller, with an anxious and apparent watching: as
soon as he caught the gaze that observed him, and which
was nearly simultaneous to both, the expression of his
eye sunk to glassiness and vacancythe former
meaning
,
however, that had disturbed the features of this
stripling, from their common idiot and stolid character,
had not been unmarked by the travellerbut it was so
much like the hate and anger-swelled countenance of vexed
childhood, that the busy mind dwelt not on ityet now
it was repeated, and in such a shape and manner, as
could leave no doubt but this fragile and feeble creature,
was soon about to take a share in some determined act
against him, and to which he looked as one gloating on
expected revenge.
Can nature, in so young and tender a plant, have
sowed feelings so fiendlike? whispered the traveller to
himself, good God! what could I have done to this
springald? my memory servesI recollect him notand
yet, though treated so brutally by these men, he seems
as if he would vent the gall of his soul on mea
stranger
to him, who hath never crossed him in lifestill,
would he were all I had to fearhowbeit, he looks as
very
an imp of mischief and blood, as ever Satan sent
earthward to plague and curse mankind.
But the traveller, in this last sentence, had done the
youth injustice: his garments, as has been mentioned,
were of the poorest kind, but there was a nobleness and
singular beauty in his person, that ill accorded with his
wretched attire: nevertheless, his mantle, with its
tattered
drapery, was wrapped so close about him, that
the delicacy of his form and features was greatly
concealed
,
except from the most prying searchand
whether
assumed or not, yet there was in general, that
absent
and unattending air about him, which well bespoke
his mental incapacity, and his want, as the hosts had
heretofore
informed, of the powers of speech and hearing
he sat partly in the light, and partly in the shadow, and as
the traveller pursued the chain of his thought with his eye
on him, he could not but acknowledge a surprise, that he
had passed this creature so cursorily, and but now been
stricken in observing himthe complexion of the youth
wore apparently a dusky tinge, but clear as the sweet
scented
olibanum,
[48]
[48]
A sweet scented gum or resin, that naturally distils out of
several trees at the foot of Mount Libanus, in white and yellow
drops. It is sometimes called the male incense.
yet where the cloak had fallen from his neck,
his skin denied that as its native hue, for in those places,
it was transparent and white as an infant's, while his
long black hair, of womanish loveliness, hung floating
careless and dishevelled, around his headhis face was
pale and wan, and his features, though regular, were
thin and emaciated by want and suffering; there he sat,
every limb motionless, stirring not from the spot where
he had placed himself, which now was lit by the quick
and bickering flame of the distant fire; and anon as it
died, left almost in dusky night, while he seemed so
fading and shadowy, that the straying fancy might have
dressed him out as some spectre in a vision, or a lost spirit
sitting penitent at the gate of Gehenna and weeping for
its departed glory. And could it have so chanced, was
the traveller in his mistrust at error, had his active
mind, eager in rendering him torment, conjured an omen
in the stripling's glance, that had never been? could he
have been so deceived as thus to imagine harm where
there was none? Yes, it was plain. The broken spirited
urchin was too much taken up with his own grief, to
injure
othersfor as the observer continued to look upon
him, he perceived his bosom rise and swell as if the heart
it covered was bursting beneath; and with slender fingers
he swept away hastily the cloud of tears that had sprung
like rain drops on his long eye-lashes.in truth the
unfortunate
child might well have expressed that image of
patient sorrow, who with
Her meek hands folded on her modest breast,
With calm submission lifts the adoring eye
Even to the storm that wrecks her.
The traveller felt his heart yearn in pity to the
parentless
,
abandoned creature; but his was not a condition to
extend assistance, and with a bitter pang he found that
he was selfish in his despair: restless and agitated, he
turned on his rough mat, and strived to shut out the
misery he beheld in the sharp remindings of the
desperate
circumstances in which he believed himself placed;
but that mild, tearful eye, and saddened countenance,
was still before himhe could not combat against them;
they seemed to beseech help, but how could he extend
it? they were as the dying cries of the perishing
follower
of an Arabian caravan, that seeketh but a drop of
water
from his comrade, to moisten his burning lip and
tongue, when he who is besought, hath but an empty
cruise, and reels himself with death and perishing thirst.
And now, as if some demon revelled in the torture
inflicted on him, and urged the barbed arrows, unsated
with the anguish he had already endured, came new food
for doubt and alarm: the guide, to whose obstinacy and
ignorance all was owing, had disappeared; when and
whither, he knew not: fruitless were the efforts he made
to recollect the Dutchman's departure; an indistinct
remembrance
of his having been a short time in the
wigwam
,
alone remained; the rest was uncertainty and
doubt; a hundred unpleasant ideas, crowded at once
upon himall was confirmedthey had been betrayed;
the road had been wandered from designedly, and if
aught had yet been wanted, it was but this, and to see
the hanger bared and pointed at the victim's breast.
Of the group near the fire, all except three abandoning
their debauch had drawn their huge cloaks about them
and stretched their limbs upon their mats, as composed
for sleepand those on watch, sat basking their brawny
bodies before the blaze, feeding the flames at times with
fresh fuel, and discoursing together in a low and stifled
tone of voice, of which now and then a half muttered
sound, louder than the rest, would reach the eager and
expectant ear of the listening traveller; but from these,
he was scarce enabled to gather much, though he held
his breath with intense attention, and though when the
light of the fire round which they had closed, and which
now scarcely pierced the sable precincts of the
darkening
hovel, cast a vivid and reddening glare upon the
deep and earnest brows of the discoursers, he strove
to read the very motions of their lips, and workings of
their muscles, but it was in vain; a faint noise was all
he could distinguish, like the busy fluttering of the wings
of some teasing insect; yet it struck him that at times,
when the mounting blaze battled through the sullen
smoke, and played strongly on the bluff and hardened
visages of the speakers, that he detected glances fearful
and ferocious, that were cast towards the place where he
lay, betokening impatience and disappointment: however,
after a short while, two of these men seemed to follow
the example of their companions; for breaking off their
conversation, they crouched themselves on the earth as
if to seek rest; while he who was left, though contending
against his weariness, stalked about the fire as on watch
and in tendence lest it might expire from neglect,
looking
as he walked upon his round with stealthy pace, like
some midnight plunderer guarding his booty; but this he
soon abandoned and sitting down he bent over the blaze
and spread his huge and sinewy hands to the heat,
delighting
in the grateful warmth; then slowly his eye lost
its habitual fiercenessfirst his head wavered like the
furze on the mountain steep, and now he would start
suddenly awake, and gaze around, yet it was not long ere
it dropped on his broad shoulder and he yielded to the
slumber, whose tyrant approach appeared to conquer all
his exertions.
Time gradually moved forward in the night. From
out the smouldering and burning heap that formed the
body of the fire would tower a tall and wavering pillar of
flame, which as sudden as it rose would sink down,
flooded
as it were by a vast and floating cloud of stifling
smoke that almost threatened its extinction, even like
the black mist of time that enshadows the glory of the
great dead, or like the dark mantle of envy that
enshrouds
and hides the glowing flight of genius; as the
fire's strength grew fainter and fainter, at intervals it
would flash up with a fitful irradiation that lit the whole
place, and rendered the sleeping and cloaked forms
around visible, stretched out like the bodies of the slain
upon the battle field, near the night fires of the warriors
that had triumphed; and now the blaze would fall,
changing the colour of every sportive flash to as many
dies as streak the skin of the dying dolphin. As it
burnt low and expiring, a small blue flame would dart like
a barbed spear on the tops of the coals and embers,
many of which still looked bright with life and ignition,
though the others wore a dye blacker than the curled
locks of the Numidian, whose darkness was slowly
creeping
on the whole bed, with an approach as sure as death
steals on the body. Still ever and anon, some wandering
breath of wind, like a small streamlet sporting from the
parent flood, leaving the rude shrill blast that it had
made a part, and which whistled fierce and angrily
around the hut, stole through some unguarded aperture
of wall, and swept o'er the fading warmth, making for a
moment, the lively red run through the blackened
stumps, like blood revisiting the veins of the heart; but
these would rejoice and sparkle but an instant, for as the
air fell the heat retired again, leaving an ashy whiteness
on the logs like the shroud of a corpse.
As the cause for vigilance seemingly declined, a sort of
stupor began involuntarily to weigh upon the senses of
the traveller. Gleam after gleam as it started or
perished
he marked, and counted minute after minute as they
departed down the stream of time; he listened to the howl
of the wild animals without, which by times would echo
from the distance, and then were answered so close to
the sides of the wigwam, as to arouse the large dogs
from their dozings at their master's feet, and force them
to point their eager ears, and utter in defiance a short
deep note of hate, ere they again sank their heads
between
their outstretched paws; he heard the moan of the
never tiring breeze, and the grief-like and hollow voice
of the forest, as it bent beneath the violent attacks of the
half renewed storm;and soon his thoughts grew
uncontrolled
,
and wandered from the objects to which he
strived to direct them, like the scattered fragments of a
wreck borne from their owner's grasp by the gamboling
waves; by degrees the gloomy figures and objects around
faded and fluctuated before his dim eyes, until the sight
Vol. I. 21
could neither rest on them nor descry their forms or
shapes: and yet he neither slept or waked, but lay like
one under the influence of a dream in the delirious dozes
of a fever, in which the wild wanderings of the disturbed
mind takes the fantasies that its own workings conjures
up, as the real actions and passings of life; and still,
withal, he thought not but that he was watching warily
and intent; for often he tossed and threw his heated and
feverish limbs from side to side on his hard couch, as he
deemed the forgetfulness of slumber preyed on his brain,
while a nearly indistinct moan would burst unconsciously
from his trembling lipsfor it seemed unto him that
broken
and disturbing murmurs rang in his ears, and at
intervals there rushed before and about him,
multitudinous
figures, and distorted and frowning masses of
beings
;
and there passed fearful events and actions around,
with the swift and rapid course of a winged whirlwind.
In vain his vision strained at first to distinguish and mark
the crowd, or one single shape; all impressed him as
familiar
,
yet his exertion to retain the memory an instant
longer than their presence, was powerless; they were a
strange, mingled and ghastly spectacle, that swam quickly
away like the waves of a stormy ocean, crossing,
bursting
and contending with each other, and taking a
thousand
varied forms, that is beyond the mariner to
remember
:
yet at one time, amid this trooping of unearthly
phantoms
,
his vision met a human face, but it was pallid and
wanits eyes lustreless and fixed, as those in the sockets
of a strangled man: and when it had caught his sight, it
stirred not, but stood without motion, with its dull and
lifeless gaze rivetted on him; while he seemed bound to it
as fascinated by some spell, against whose influence he
was unable to resist, though his heart panted and
knocked
at his ribs, and his brain felt as bursting: anon the
spectre came nearer to him, and he felt a cold and icy
grasp, that thrilled through every nerve, and the damp
and clammy perspiration sprang from every pore at the
death-like touch,sore he strove to fly, and struggled
in agony, as one battles for life: but his antagonist
grappled
him with the strength of a giant; vain he strained;
he was as a stripling in the gripe of a grown man: and
then he deemed he was dragged along, in spite of his
convulsive efforts, with a velocity like the wind drives
an atom; his head grew giddy, and his sense whirled in
faintness;at last they appeared to reach the steep brink
of a dark precipice, adown whose gloomy side his enemy
strove to thrust him,below, was black and gloomy as a
den; the depth was pierceless, fathomless; and now it
seemed as if his limbs sank beneath him, and he was
struck still and strengthless, in the hands of his
merciless
foe; his very voice was thralled, and his cries were
choked in his throat, while his parched tongue clove
dry as dust to his mouth; then a weight like lead was
heaped upon his breast; it pressed heavier and heavier;
the ribs creaked, scarce able to support the burthen; his
veins started, and a cold shivering ran through his blood;
when, as if loosed by the invisible hand of a sorcerer,
he was disenthralled; freed from the terrible force that
lay upon him; but as he fled, a hundred months
appeared
shrieking and shouting around him; onward and
onward he went, through mist and night, but the steps
of pursuit were behind, while his ear throbbed at the
sound, as though pierced with the sharpest steel; closer
and closer they came; he felt the very wind pass him,
from the floating of their garments; he shuddered with
terror; again he thought that grave-cold hand was on
him; he sank as he felt its icy gripe, as withered by a
stroke of palsy; a broken shriek of pain and horror
rose on his lips, as he heard the triumphant howl of his
persecutor; with desperate and frenzied force, he
struggled
andawoke. But yet so lively was the impression
made on his heated imagination, by the wild and
thronging
phantasies of his fevered vision, that it was sometime
ere he could drive away the shapesthe gliding and
gibbering phantoms that had disturbed him in dream
nor was he able to hinder his distress of mind, giving
itself
vent and relief by a deep and desparing sigh.
Merciful heaven, he ejaculated unconsciously, half
aloud, though in that whispering tone of voice that
assimilated
to his agitated chain of thought, the very
bitterness of death, exceeds not this.
There are those who watch for thy safety at hand,
said a voice in answer close to his sidethe words, though
they were tremulous and low, as if the lip that uttered
them, had quivered in doubt or fearful haste, yet
sounded
distinct, sweet and clear, as the music of a viol.
The traveller started with involuntaty surprisethe
the strange and stirring fancies of his sleep, seemed
scarcely dissipated.
Good God! what are you?howwhere?
exclaimed
he rapidly, and eagerly glancing his eyes around
in the darkness.
He could see nothing, and no answer was returned
he repeated his words, and sought his question louder.
Who do you want? what the devil are you?
returned
a hoarse and surly voicewhy the devil do you
set off your pederero at this rate? an you rest not
yourself
,
break not that of others.
The incident had now completely aroused the traveller;
he deemed an explanation with the last speaker would
afford
no satisfaction, for even yet he felt uncertain whether
the voice had not been a mere delusion of his thoughts, half
sleeping and awakening, embodied in an answer, that had
impressed not the ear, though the mind had so fancied; he
therefore remained silent, and in a few moments heard
the person who had just addressed him, renew his inquiry
with an oath, at having been disturbed without reason
then again all was still and hushed, unbroken by a sound,
except the deep and hard breathings of the sleepers
around.
The fire had by this time sank to a few, half-lighted
and nearly dying brands, that sent out neither heat nor
warmth, and the traveller shivered as he felt the
chillness
of the night, and the cold of the season strike his
blood; he drew his mantle closer to his body, and lay
with his limbs huddled on his mat. Suddenly, there was
a slight movement near him, as of the gliding step of one
stealing with cautious pace, as fearful of being discovered,
and almost at the same time, the voice he had before been
startled by, came to his ear with a note as melodious and
as soft as the silvery song of beauty in her midnight
bower.
For your life's sake, be stillspeak not, said the
voice hurriedly, your rashness will endanger others,
and you are lost for ever: stir not, notice not whatever
come that may alarmyou are in bad hands, yet trust in
heaven there was a hasty noise as of a guarded and
suppressed converse in a farther part of the wigwamthe
voice pursued, as if quickened at being overheard, and
at the same time, making the communication so low as to
render it impossible for any listening, to distinguish a
syllable
,
time wears fastcan you, will you place
confidence
in a strangeryou must, you've no other chance,
and I swearbut what avails an oath; you have those
things with you that will cost your heart's blood; give
them me, they shall be safeit will preserve you.
The total darkness around, though he must have even
stooped above him, rendered the traveller unable to see
his mysterious visiter, and the rapidity with which he was
now spoken to, gave him scarce time to reflect, and his
first impulse was to draw partly from his bosom the
packet that was demanded; but as he felt a cold, eager,
trembling hand touch his lightly to receive the treasure,
an indecisive feeling came on him.
I dare notwho are you? said he, that knoweth
my business so well, and seeks so singular a favour from
me: What pledge of your faith have I?No! no! my
life, if it be sought, shall end with my duty.
Rash man, you know not what you do, returned the
voice in a yet quicker and hurried accent, for God's
sake, delay not thus. If I mean you not fair, may I drop
a corse the instanthush, I hear themthey come; they
are here.
As the voice finished the last broken sentence, the
traveller
became conscious, that with an action sudden as
unexpected, the hand of the speaker had glided under his
arm, and bewildered as he was by the boldness of the
attempt, as by all that had passed, ere he could guard
against it, or even seize the intruder, the entrusted
documents
,
21*
the charge on which so much depended, were
gone; snatched from him in a moment. With a terrific
cry of rage, he would have sprung after the nocturnal
demon who had robbed him, but as he strove to rise, a
powerful grasp withheld him, and bore him backwards to
the earth.
Vile assassin! loosen thy hold, or bitterly shalt thou
rue the hour, cried the traveller, as with desperate force
he endeavoured to free himself from his antagonist, and
to draw his weapon from his side.
Nuestra senora, an you swing your martinets thus,
damn thee, I shall cut your painter, said the adversary,
pressing his knee on the bosom of the prostrate soldier.
Base dog! dost thou intend to murther me? Stoll,
comradehelp! help!
Carra, man, thy mate will have enow to do to fight
his own ship.
Alas! Hal, I hear thy call, said the voice of the en
sign, dolefully, but I am bound, and my body lays as
dead as ever did the mullar of Poussin.
Ho, Lumby, Jenkins, Lofe, shouted the pirate
impatiently
,
hang out the glim; curse ye, lazy lubbers, it is
as dark as a squall of Cape Hatteras. Congo, you black
serpent, why you are as slow as thof you'd never handled
a rope, and this fellow flounders like a fresh caught shark.
After a few vain and exhausting efforts of resistance,
the limbs of the traveller were secured, and he became
motionless in the power of the desperadoes; the faint
rays of a lighted lanthorn, upheld in the hand of one of
the ruffians, now pierced the gloom of the hovel.
Mass, senor caballero, but it is no small job to hold
off thy capstern, whelps, said the conqueror, carra,
thy hawse is crossed this side of the windlass, for damn ye!
d'ye see, we are lads con todo el mondo guerra, as Don
Anthonio, our linguister, says, and it must be a quick
helmsman that steers clear of the grapnel of the brethren
of the coast.
Oho, mate, change thy mizen, interposed a ruffian,
savagely placing his hand on the prisoner, blast it, the
tide waits for no man; so let's overhaul the prize.
Aye, lads, added another, what's their cargo? clear
away the rigging, and let's have a sight of all under
hatches.
Move thy hulk aside, echoed a third, why damn
it, thou art like a head sealet me rip the canvass.
Give sea roomwhat has he aboard? give sea
room, vociferated others, as they crowded about the
captives.
In a few minutes, the garments of the travellers
were rifled of every valuable, and rent and cut to pieces,
by the brutal hands and keen tucks of the freebooters,
as they eagerly contended for the spoil.
Avast, messmates, said the commander, interposing,
this is no time to slacken your braceseach lad shall
have his fair share of the booty, but now there's no time
for it; so look close to what papers the dogs bear; for
an I am not on a wrong coast, we have ta'en to-night
that which is worth the bravest flota.
Now by my halidome! said Jost Stoll imploringly,

that is my most precious workif ye have any
pity, any mercy, kill merend me in atoms, buthave

Fools, what have ye here? exclaimed the rover,
as with a quick and careless hand, disregarding the
intercessions
and anguish of the agitated ensign, he ran
over the papers that contained the drawings so sacred to
the amateur, and which, after a moment's examination,
were cast to the earth in contempt, these are not
what I seekare there none other? art sure? none
otherby, the vile and crafty knave hath
suspected
me, and destroyed themspeak outwhere is thy
trust? continued he gazing furiously in the face of the
younger traveller, who moved not beneath his eye, but
kept a sullen silencewhere hast thou hid the papers
with which thou wast charged? dost hear me? hadst
thou nothing for Van Courtlandt's friendsfor the
younger Bayard factionfor Schuyler? wilt not
answer
?
do you know who you brave? may my soul be
damned, an I rip not the secret from thy heart.
Thou hast already done thy worst, base outlaw, at
length returned the traveller composedly, and with a
calm and determined utterance, why then mock me
with inquiries thou knowest are as bootless, as if thou
sought an answer from the rocks? I have fallen by thy
stratagem; I know my life is forfeit, and I have no wish
to live: therefore trouble me no more, but end my
miseries
with your hungry knives.
Obstinate, rash idot, cried the buccaneer,
apparently
goaded by the firmness of his prisoner, beyond
the controlling of his raging passions, dost brave me
by hell! young man, thou hadst better rouse the wild devil,
than waken my anger; sooth, boy, thou may'st not deem

blood: he paused in expectation of an answer, but
none was returnedfor an instant he appeared as
endeavouring
to smother the rising choler which almost
choaked him; his limbs trembled like a child's, or as if
stricken with an ague fit; then no longer able to bound
the tiger fury which swelled him, he burst forth with a
voice hoarse as the first tremendous rush of the travado,
when it leaps from the mountain to the oceanspawn
of hell, he cried, wilt keep thy damned silence? thou
art bolda very bold man: now hearken, thou wilt not
wag that tongue o' thine one jotha! by  may I be a
dead man this hour, if I have it not torn out by the
roots; it shall not serve thee for one word again; thou
knowest not what I can do; of all, thou dream'st not,
what I will have done to thee; thou shalt die piecemeal;
what ho! my hounds thereye shall have food; your
tusks shall peel a banquet from this fellow's carcass.
As he spoke, he gave an encouraging signal, which
was answered by the dogs, who with savage bounds
sprang from the earth, towards their victim, growling,
and showing through the snowy foam that hung upon
their lips, their white huge and sharp teeth, and their
eyes kindling to balls of fire: the rover's followers
stood in a gloomy crowd, advancing their fierce visages
to view the scenewhile a horrid gratification seemed
dwelling on their hardened features.
On him, knaves, shouted the marauder, an ye
leave one gout of flesh to moisten his bones, by  I'll
have you beaten that ye have done your duty so ill.
With a ferocious howl, the dogs flew on the captive
who, defenceless and bound, vainly struggled to free a
limb, to oppose the blood seeking animalshe strained
and tugged, until the veins of his arms swelled thick as
cords upon the skinhis heart throbbed quickly against
his sidethe blood coursed in floods of fire through
every
part of his bodyyet had he been as still and stirless
as a corse stark for the burial, he had not been more
powerlesswith the strength of despair, he bit at the
bonds that held himbut his vain endeavours to free
himself, merely excited bursts of unpitying laughter
from the merciless tormentors, who gazed upon his
agonies
with that brutal indifference of the pain inflicted, and
with that exultation of enjoyment of the sport, with which
the matador eyes the dying gasps of the conquered bull.
The fangs of one of the dogs were fastened in his side,
the other, hanging to his shoulder as to the flank of a
flying hind, darted at his throat; wildly, madly did he
strive to cast him from his hold, but the well trained
beast kept snapping at that which instinct seemed to
guide him, as the fatal spot from which he could destroy
life. The baited victim felt the animal's teeth compress
and pierce the collar that was wound around his neck, as
though it was the edge of some deadly instrument that
cut it through; their sharp points seemed to touch his
skin like the ends of needles, and his very marrow
thrilled
within him; a moment the stiff ruff was his defence
then it parted, severed, and the bare tusks entered his
flesh, which appeared to peel away before their iron
power like shrivelled parchment, and the blood trickled
warm as fire adown his bosom, and dyed the jaws of the
ferocious brute;his sense wavered, his brain seemed
bursting in agony, the balls of his eyes distended, and all
around was vivid as day:the flash of the beast's eyes
met his, they looked like flakes of living flamethe force
of a giant gathered in himthe cords that tightened
round his wrist broke in twainan instant and his fingers
tore open the gullet of the animal who had seized him so
dangerouslyhe pursued his conquestthe bite of the
dog relaxedhe hung fainterhe droppedstaggered
sunk his head and died, uttering a savage moan with
his last breath.
The whole action was but an instant, for almost ere
the companion fell, the other dog had sprang on the arm
that had o'erthrown him, and was fast urging the revenge
for his death, while his antagonist, enteebled even by his
victory, shook as one dying; for now a film of darkness
came upon him, and he seemed stricken as by a blow of
lightning unto ashes; he strove against it, but the blood
rushed to his head; beads of cold dew streamed on his
brows, until they ran like dust into his sight; his ears
were filled as by the gurgling of watersnature could
not bear his agonieshe reeled,he could seehe
could hear no more, but dropped down on the bloody
carcass of his dead foe, and lay in the welling flood of
gore, like a thing without motion, feeling, or life.
How long he remained thus insensible he recked not,
but it was not long; though it was a void dismal, chill,
and vacantan unbroken dreamless sleep; yet soon his
scattered faculties began to return, and gather might and
distinctness, like a defeated army when rallied after the
rout and the pursuit; at first he strove to rise, but found
his limbs yet firmly chained by his bonds, and in the vain
effort the thongs almost cut him to the bone, with the
quickness
of tempered steel: a hundred pains shot through every
nerve, violent shiverings shook his limbs;then he moved
his hand to his heart; his clothes were rent in the
struggle
,
and his fingers stuck to the bare flesh; he drew them
away, for they were covered with clotted blood that
poured down from his wounds, which were now numbed,
deadened; he gazed wildly about him; the swarthy and
unrelenting countenance of the buccaneer met his look;
there he stood holding back the hound, that had been
called off from the prey, and whose eagerness was yet
untamed, so that he could scarce be restrained from again
leaping on the travellerfor the instant he saw him stir,
he started as though he would have rushed on him and
sated his hate. The fainting captive closed his eyes; a
sensation at once sickly and blasting came over himhe
felt like some prisoner respited at the death hour, but for
a day; brought back when the bitterness of death was
past, again to have his miseries renewed, again to gaze
with anxious thought beyond the darksome gate; again
to feel minute after minute glide away towards that
fearful
hour of inevitable fate; again to count drop after drop,
as the sand ran through the prison hour of glass; while
his every prayer for life was mocked by his persecutors,
who rejoiced in his despair like the cruel urchin who
triumphs in the convulsive contortions of a tortured worm,
whose pains and distress he increases by repeated wounds,
till the last spark of existence fleets away, and is then
hardly glutted with its miserable death,a groan burst
from the lips of the traveller in the very bitterness of his
anguish.
How say you now, master? said Kid, am I not
one who keepeth the words of threat I give? troth, thou
art of right stuff, as is thy comrade, you jolly knave;
but this is no place or hour to spin long yarnsso which
of ye have taken wit in your counsel and will satisfy on
that which I have sought?
By the memory of Leonardi De Vinci, muttered
Jost Stoll, doggedly, though you make dog's meat of
me, you'll find me as dumb as a pannel ere it is touched
by the brush; ay, on my halidome, what have I to live
for? look at my sketches, my studies, originals and copies,
all torn, stained, trod under footoh, you barbarians, had
I but the use of my rapier. I'd make a composition among
you equal to Holbein's dance of death.
What! and is it these daubs, these crankums, that it
would take a conjuror to make head or tail of, that you
make this storm about? said the free trader, why curse
it, man, they are not worth thy care; they are not baubles
that would amuse a childcheer up and bear a hand
come, my boy, we'll have faith between us; chuck this
nonsense overboard, and venture with me, I'll glut you
with golden pictures; thof an you like, there's many an
altar piece that would bring ducats with the rich at home,
that we'll not grudge you ship room, after sacking a church
or rifling a convent.
The ensign's attention appeared alone to be aroused by
the first words of the buccaneer's address to him
What mean you? replied he, angrily, 'sdeath,
daubs! now by the soul of Rembrandt, I have never
been so insulteddaubs! hark you, Sir, do you know what
sketching is? did you ever see the studies of Raphael
D'Urbino? of Michael Angelo? of Titian? of the
Caracci
?
daubs! death and the devil! just (I am tied, and
can't) pick up that outline of a landscape that lies by my
foot, I'll show you perspective, keeping, composition,
grouping, foliage:damn it, it is easy to see you have no
more taste than an owl. What would you say to Sir
Godfrey's
first study of his Bacchante? daub! daub! ha?
I tell thee what master, returned the other, thy
comrade here keeps his stays too taught, and thy jaws
are too slack, for thy brain is as cracked as ever was the
chink of a rotten wreck; so d'ye hear? I'll have no more
of your wild palaver; but damn you, you porpoise-faced
swab, an thou and thy mate here do not see fit to answer
me in one half hour, you shall both be beaten to death
with the flats of our cutlassesI swear it; you have but
that short while to reckon accounts with this world; so
curse ye, mulish dogs, make the best of it. Come boys,
continued he, addressing his companions, you have not
turned in long to-night, and we have two glasses yet, ere
morning, or ere we can see the way to our lugger, so you
that stand in need, take out your matsstay Eumet, it is
your watch; you will find Luath beyond the threshhold
keep a look out ahead, there may be ferret-hawkers
aboardthere is no fear of these knaves getting loose or
disturbing our sleep, but at all events, at times, give an
eye. At the first peep of dawn arouse me, and by God,
an they then speak not to the better purpose, their mouths
shall be sewn up for ever.
So saying, the reckless freebooter enfolded himself in
his wide mantillo, and threw himself on the ground; his
ruffian attendants, with the exception of Eumet, who left
the interior of the wigwam as he was ordered, followed
the example of their leader, and in a short time all was
again hushed and still as the grave within the so late busy
and stirring hovel.
The traveller attempted not to arise from the cold earth
whereon he had sank, lost and despairing: indeed so
hard and strongly had his bonds now been drawn and
secured
around his limbs, that an endeavour was uselessly
exhausting their weakened and waning powerand as
he felt the moments pass, conscious that each that flitted
to the shades, drew him nearer to the close that awaited
himhis death hour, the very desire of existence,
appeared as departing; and fast he gave way to a
hopeless
lethargy, which seemed to tighten with cords of iron
about his brain; his lacerated neck, his torn side, were
painlessthe blood had ceased to flow, though the black
and curdled gouts hung stiff and dry to his broken
garments
.
A few paces from him, unremoved by his
careless
masters, lay the carcass of the slain houndhis half
opened eyes still retained a glassy lustre, and his teeth
were firmly set against each other; large dashes of gore
were on him, and his contracted limbs showed what
dreadful struggles had preceded death: sick, wearied and
fainting, the traveller closed his eyes, and in the depth
of his anguish, he wished for the death that now was
lingering
and
he lay as if the stroke had already fallen; but he
remained not so long, for soon he was conscious of a
cooling feeling that came o'er his burning and aching
Vol. I. 22
brow, as if his beating temples were bathed by some
pleasant liquid, and like in the pauses of some dream,
he distinguished a gentle voice that strove to impart
comfort, as though some benignant and ministering
being
,
like a guardian spirit of pity and succour, that wings
around the tiresome couch of sickness, hovered about
him; he looked, and beheld the pirate's boy.
Awake, whispered he in a tone low and fearful,
your bonds are cutyour comrade is at my sidebe
quick, and follow silentlyfor should they stir, we're
lost.
He started from the ground mechanically, at the
bidding
of the youth, and stood a moment breathless; a
mist swam before him, and with a faint sigh, he would
have again fallen to the earth, had it not been for the
supporting arm of the ensign. This way, this way,
said the boy hurriedly, and gazing wild and trembling
about him as he spoke, your lives depend on your
caution
follow
me.
By my halidome! brave youth, exclaimed the
ensign
,
but I
For God's sake, question me not nowbut swift
follow, said the boy, tread light, lest you arouse them.
And like a spectre flitting among church-yard tombs,
he glided over the prostrate bodies of the sleepers: by
the flickering light of the lanthorn, which still burned
from the centre of the hut feebly and irregularly, they
pursued their guide with a step so soft, that not an echo
was heard from it: as they stole along, the sleeping Kid
lay before them; they started, for his eyes were wide
open and looking towards them; and his lips moved as
to stay their flightFear not, said their preserver,
he sleeps soundly.
As the boy spoke, he stooped above the buccaneer,
and dexterously undid the long dark sea cloak which
wrapt his brawny limbs, and gently drawing it from his
body, he turned back and threw it over the shoulders of
the younger travellerwho pressed in silent gratitude,
the hand of the noble youth.
By my halidome, exclaimed Jost Stoll, that dog's
head were worth carrying awayWarren would give
the weight in gold to have it
[49]
[49]
Commodore Warren, commander of the squadron sent to
cruise in search of Kid, off the Cape of Good Hope and Cape
Comorin, and Colonel Bass, Governor of East Jersey, offered large
reward for his apprehension; an amnesty being extended to all
the other free traders who would come in, excepting Kid and
Every
and by Saint Paul, it
would make an exquisite sketchhist, yonkerdo you
think there is time for me to take the outlines? I wont
be a minute
Are you mad, said the boy, see you not he stirs?
heaven have mercy! I fear me Loffe has wakenedthis
way, for your lives sakefor mine, if you care not for
your ownfollow me in silence.
With a quick and noiseless pace, hardly daring to look
behind them, lest they should behold the dark visages
of the buccaneers peering over their shoulders, or feel
their deadly and iron grasps, they proceeded on and
gained the door of the wigwam unmolested; its covering
of deer hide was uplifted, and the sweet and free breath
of the heavens blew in upon them, bearing, with its
refreshening
touch, renewed vigour to their doubting hearts.
By the fame of Lanfranco, exclaimed Jost Stoll,
looking back in the hovel, an my eyes deceive me not,
yonder by that snoring slave, lays my head from
Tintoretto
;
it seems but little injured: an I die for it, I will
not lose it; troth, to abandon so fine a specimen, were
an insult to the arts.
What are you about? exclaimed his comrade,
withholding
him as he motioned to return, surely you will
not so rashly run on danger, and risk instant death to all,
and for such a bauble?
Bauble! replied the ensign, struggling to break from
him, a drawing like that a baublesuch sweetness of
shadow, flowing of lines, mellowness of finish, for it is
coloured
the very counterpart of the original, which brought
five hundred louis at the auction of the famous collection
of the Duc de Montmorenci, and is now one of the chef
d'uvres in the gallery of the Luxemburghbauble!
why man, you know no more of the arts than a half
bred spaniel. You should hear what Sir Godfrey
Kneller
said
For mercy, ensign, hold a moment; hear methink
where you arethink
Think, and such a picture at stake? by my halidome,
there is not time to think.
On! on! we shall be lost, cried the youth,
impapatiently
urging forward the younger traveller.
I must not, will not, leave this incautious man behind.
See, boy, he quits us though I
Then let the dotard idiot perish in his obstinacy; there
are more lives at hazard than his, as the stripling spoke,
with a hasty and firm grasp, he seized the arm of the
irresolute traveller, and with a strength beyond his
childish
appearance, but which was mustered by a sudden
desperation
and determined action, he drew him onwards,
and ere he had a thought to oppose, they were without
the wigwam, and the hide was dropped athwart the
doorway
:
but their escape was not yet effected.
There is a friend who should have watched here;
but I see him not, anxiously whispered the boy as he
paused and gazed around: what could have happened?
he cannot be falseyet I fear me all is not right.
Upon the broad visage of the heavens but slight
vestige
of the late fearful tempest remained; here and there
alone, a few small, broken and fleecy clouds of rack, like
gay flocks of white-winged birds, swept in scattered
bodies on the blue horizon, at times obscuring the lordly
moon, who was hastening to her wane, with a misty veil;
yet beneath the light of the fair orb, all was a wide and
blighted waste: the clear snow, ghastly as the cheek of
death, lay all around; wreaths of it dangled like garlands
on every tree and bush, and hung on the low and ruinous
gables of the hovel, which could scarcely be discerned from
the deep and heavy drifts which had been piled against it
by the wind. A small cloud floated before the moon; the
fugitives waited with breathless impatience till it had
passed on its course, and the full radiance glittered on the
sparkling snow.
Great God! I do not see him; he has deserted us
what will become of us? cried the youth in a tone of
piercing despair, and wringing his hands in fear.
A slight quick sound, like the foot of a living creature,
pressing in the fresh snow and beating gently the ground,
met the anxious ear of the traveller.
Hark! softly whispered he to his companion, I
hear some one; he whom you look for
Oh no! no! cried the youth bitterly, undone!
undone!
At this moment, the hound that had accompanied the
huntsman who had discovered the travellers, in the
former
section, came leaping from around an angle of the
hut. When he beheld the fugitives, he stopped short,
and drawing himself back on his hind legs, he raised his
long ears, and uttered a hoarse, deep growl; the stripling
seemed sinking to the earth in terror; but at once
mustering
his self-possession, he advanced boldly towards the
animal, who, as he drew near, apparently laid aside his
ferocity, and when he had recognised the youth, bounded
joyfully about him.
What cheer, springal, ha? who have you there?
said a fierce voice, and the hunter stood before them.
The boy, with a wonderful command of feeling, at the
very instant he beheld the man, composed his
countenance
and resumed the idiot gaze of listlessness, which
he had worn within the wigwam when in attendance on
the ruffians; slowly appearing to gather the meaning of
the question, from the action that accompanied it, he
made a hasty sign, pointing towards the hovel and the
traveller and then to the forest, as if to intimate they were
despatched on an errand by those within; and lastly, he
made a sign as if to enforce that the matter was secret
and emergent. The traveller drew the pirate's cloak close
about him.
The hunter hesitated. This is a strange business
who is with you, said he, motioning the question as he
spoke.
The youth signed again in return. What, Eumet,
22*
said the hunter; by God! this is not so; one might as
soon snare a leveret out of season, as to keep him silent
from an outlandish proverb; this is not him; andHa!
As he spoke, a loud and terrific shout, that rung like a
death knell, was heard from within the wigwam
By hell! I was not out of the scent, cried the
hunter
,
as he levelled his musquetoon at the traveller;
yield thy life.
But ere his hand touched the lock of the piece, the boy
sprang upon his arm, and held it down in spite of his
efforts
to free himself. At the same time the traveller,
darted forward, and ere he could shake off the hold that the
youth had seized with the energy of desperation, the
hunter
was fiercely grappled with, and was cast to the earth,
more by the quickness of the attack than the strength of
his adversaries; the musquetoon was wrenched from his
hand.
Villain! cried the traveller, as he pointed the
weapon
,
take thy rich deserts.
A loud and heart-rending shriek from the youth broke
on the attention of the traveller ere he could discharge
the gun.
Save me, oh save me! cried the boy.
The dog, attracted by the scuffle and the imminent
stress of his master, had with a loud bark flown at the
throat of the youth, as if he would have torn him to
pieces in the rescue. The traveller stepped back and
instantly
fired; the beast, with a long, hollow, and
revengeful
howl fell weltering in his bloodwhile at nearly the
like instant something passed by the traveller, cutting the
air with a sharp hissing noise. The traveller turned
hastily round, and beheld the hunter reel back, while his
brains and gore gushed out in every direction; the
tomahawk
of the Indian was buried in the skull of the ruffian.
The whole struggle from the alarm to the hunter's
death, scarce occupied the time taken in the relation.
Brother, said the savage, thy feet must be like
the wild cat, thy foemen are behind.
He seized the traveller by the hand, and plunged
forward
towards a small thicket of underwood, followed by
the boy; dashing loads of snow on every side as they ran.
Scarcely had they gained the cover of the brush, which
was but a stone's throw distance from the wigwam, ere
their flight was quickened by the hoarse curses of the
buccaneers, whose shouts and cries sounded loudly in
their rear, while a shower of balls, followed by the quick
reports of the arquebusses, flew thick about them,
cutting
the air and branches, and shaking down wreaths of
snow from the trees around. With the celerity of a
squirrel the Indian rushed onwards, dragging his
comrades
,
whose limbs were strained by desperation to the
tightest chord; they darted down a rocky and stony
path, whose shagged points and splinters pierced their
feet at every boundbut yet it staid them not; through
hedges dark and tangled, of the strongest rushes, which
winter had not been able to destroy, and of which at other
times there was not one of them could have bent a
branch, they struggled, nor paused to draw a breath;
they looked behind but as the panting stag in the hot
pursuit, to gather fresh power of limb to speed, from the
closer shouts of the hunters. After having pursued a
straight course for a considerable distance, the ground
becoming more and more unequal, rendered the route
tedious and difficult; at last altering their direction of
path, the Indian led for a dark grove of gloomy pines,
within whose embowering shade they entered; and
there owing to the closeness of the trunks of the trees,
the snow was not deep, and afforded them more ease in
running. And now the cries of the pursuers, and the
deep-mouthed bay of their hound, grew more distant;
and the scattered reports of their musquetoons, as they
fired signals to each other, or at the shadows which
deceived
them with likeness of the fugitives, grew
fainter
and fainter, and at last all ceased; and they could
hear the quick and heavy beatings of their hearts alone,
as they panted against their ribs with the exertion that
they had undergone; at length, after nearly an hour's
unceasing
speed along the most precipitous and unbroken
ways, the Indian paused, although his swiftness had been
unabated, and he appeared now but little wanting of
rest; but his companions were worn down and jaded to
sickness; yet now, danger was o'erand they seated
themselves on a small rise of ground which the wind
had swept clear of snow, and rested in safety.
Wild and tumultuous were the feelings of the
traveller
he
could scarcely realize the events that had
passed
;
all was like the thronging objects of some swift
fleeting vision of sleep, that although transitory and
unsubstantial
,
clings still vividly to the memory; his own
action in the incidents of the flight, seemed prompted by
impulse alone, that was not to be swayed unshared by
the guidance of the mind; indeed so utterly hopeless
had he been, so sunken and lost by despair, that not a
wish remained, but a speedy extinction of his miseries:
and when roused from this bitterness of wo, when freed
and rescued from bondage and death, he felt as much
overpowered with the sudden change of fortune, as he
had been in his uttermost depth of sorrow; he was like
the desperate and shipwrecked seaman, who had clung
long to the rock, and struggled long in vain to climb from
the wave, lifted by some friendly hand to the secure shore,
even in the last moment when his strength was failing, and
his hold to the bare and slippery side grew weaker and
weaker, and his eye was dim with death; and now,
though distant from danger, the whelming waters of the
unquiet sea, were hurtling in his ears, and still the
sky-crowned
billows were tumbling in his sight: the limbs
of the traveller yet smarted from the bonds that had
held him, but he moved them unshackled; his soul drew
in the very breath of the free air that wantoned around,
but his lips uttered not a sound, though his hand pressed
on his swelling and surcharged bosom.
Brother, said the red man, the great Spirit hath
looked on you with an eye like a father looks on his
dearest childthe edge of the tomahawk was sharpened
the fires of the captors were lighted, and the victim
was led to the stake; but the arrows of thy enemies
have not reached you, but have fallen to the earth as
heavily as the musklonghi plunges in the deep lake;
and now thou art far from the following of thy foes; the
gamesome wekolis that sings in the broad espetonga
tree, is not more fearless than thou mayest be brother,
the rising sun will show thee the smoke of the white
man's fires; thy brethren are within the echo of thy
voice.
Brave, generous preserverswhat do I not owe
thee? burst from the traveller as he seized their hands
and pressed them fervently within his own, thou hast
saved my worthless life at the risk of your own
blood; can I ever make you a returnnobut yet
something I may doyou know not whom you have
rescued
it
may not be proper nowbut there will come a
time, when it will be mine to grant you favours beyond
all you can hope; and when I refuse you what you may
ask, even though it be that which I may not well
do, yet if I refuse you, I repeat it, may the face of
heaven, which hath so smiled upon me, be for ever
turned from me.
Stranger, said the boy in a solemn and melancholy
tone, I, for my own part, ask nothing of youyet there
may happen that, even in my life, which may cause you to
remember what you have just spoken, and that one whom
you met in the midst of murderers, and who perhaps had
as much cause as they to wish you dead, preserved you
from their hands: remember this, I seek no more.
I will never forget it, and from this moment thou
shalt be a constant care to me.
No, stranger, we were not born to be friends, replied
the youth firmly, the sun that now wakens on the
waters
below us, will see our courses divide perhaps for
ever.
Nay, but hear me
Thou need'st not speak, said the stripling, for
words are waste to change my counsel. I am neither
friendless, nor deserted; you have been deceived in my
appearance; talk not of itwhen I want your assistance,
I shall not fail to call on you; till then, let the subject
sleepand look down, mark you not through the cleft of
you hill, the roofs and spires and masts? Yon is the
city.
The quick piercing cold, that preludes a winter
morning
,
had slowly abated; a pallid hue blanched to
whiteness
the broad eastern sky, and a vivid light ran like fire
through the whole heavens; yet when the sun rose, it
was dull and dim of aspect: shorn of its tabernacle of
glorious clouds of purple and of gold, it looked like some
warrior from the field of discomfiture and defeat, his
armour stained, his weapons soiled, and his eyes turned
earthwards, for very shame at his lost conquest and his
flight. A sharp, frosty wind heralded his approach, and
as it whistled over the tall heads of the forest and the
mountain, drove before its rushing path, mighty clouds of
mist and vapour, that had slumbered above the snow from
whence they had gatheredyet the wind did not wholly
dissipate these dense and voluminous masses, though it
blew them along, rendering distinct the deep gullies of the
hill and the peaks of the high rocks, throwing the mists
that had hid and crowned them, in mingled troops and
confused and changeful heaps, that mimicked to the eye
of fancy the shapes of crowded armies, of tall castles,
ample palaces, and towering pinnacles; but as the sun
rose higher, these faded away, and the scene became
more plain and clear to the eager sight. They sat on the
verge of a hill; behind them lay the forest they had fled
through in the night, close, dark, leafless and dreary,
unpiercible
to the inquiring eye; to the left was a flat waste
land, covered with drifts of snow, and chequered with
blue ice, that bound the numerous morasses and swamps
in a wintry garment, while here and there, on the firmer
ground, rose the steep roofs and tall chimneys of some
Dutch farm house; to the right, yet lower than where
they looked from, lay thickets of dwarf oak, garlanded
with icicles that sparkled in the sun, rocks, knolls, and
crags, and the varieties of uncultivated nature; and
washing
the broad bases of these, rolling and curling beneath
the morning breeze, and glittering like silver in its course
under the sunbeam, flowed a mighty river, whose
opposite
shores were high hills and banks and waving woods,
that twinkled in the light, and over whose tops the fleeing
mists hovered in fleecy whiteness, looking like a filmy
veil of silver gauze; a howker, with its broad and snowy
sails set to the wind and its leeboard up, was riding the
waves, looking like the white bosomed cygnet swimming
the river, and here and there in the distance, almost lost
in the frosty atmosphere, peered forth the sails of other
water craft, while dark spots upon the afar off waves,
showed the gay islands that gemmed this noble stream
Immediately
before the gazer's eye stretched out a point of
land, dark and black, and where the fog lingered longest,
but when at last it cleared away, there was the city to
which the boy had pointed, the tiled roofs glittering in the
silvery radiance of the now smiling sunlight, and a few
domes and spires, that rose above these like spears over
the heads of a marching band of soldiers.
Stranger, said the stripling, the time hath arrived;
we must now separate. Be not surprised when I tell
you I know the man and the objects that you seek: but
ere I go let me give safely back to your hands, unopened,
the packet which I snatched from your reluctant keeping.
Think not that I have pryed into these papers; that what
I have learnt of you has come from these: it is not so,
for your own eyes must convince you that not a seal that
holds them hath been even strained.
So saying, he drew forth the papers, and gave them to
the surprised and wondering traveller.
Noble, inexplicable boy! exclaimed he, how shall
I thank you? But do you really intend to leave me, and
now?
Our ways are different, replied the youth; yonder
road, that leads downwards to the lowlands, will carry
you safe and straight to Bayard's Bouwerieif I mistake
not that is the path that will suit you. Mine is to the
borders of yon gallant river.
Yet stay one momentanswer meyou must not
leave me thus.
Brother, said the Indian, it is in vain for you to
track our footsteps, as for the heavy bear to gain on the
speed of the cleft footed moose; thou wilt turn unto the
dwellings of the warriors of thy race; our path is
towards
the setting sun; I have sworn to follow the brave
youth who loosened the cords of thy enemiesand the
White Skinned Beaver breaks not his oath; my mother the
earth, hath taken back the warriors and the children of my
name, yet I have found one for whom I would live; my
heart was vacant, desolatebut it hath received the
balsam that the great Spirit pours in the wounds of the
hopeless; brother, thou seekest the fires of the white
mangoyet remember the white man loves not his
brother, more than he loves the red Indianye
belong
to one familyye walk in the same pathyet ye
assist not each other to bear your burdensthough ye
slake your thirst at the same spring, ye lend not unto
each other your cupsbrother; bewarethe white
people
are to one another like poisonous serpents; they
give not the weary man a place to spread his blanket, or
wood to kindle his fires; rather would they be the wolf,
to make his wigwam tenantless, and his corn field a
desert
;
they love to take up the hatchet against their
brother, and make it fat with blood; they will drink the
blood even of their own people. Brother, if we meet
not again, may our great Father, who is alike the friend
of the white and the red man for we are all his children,
protect you as he hath done since the last sunset; may
the great Spirit be angry with thy enemies, and destroy
them from the earth with his terrible breath, which is a
devastating winda rushing water.
As the savage finished speaking, he departed after
the boy, leaving the traveller to pursue their swift steps
with his eyes, in astonishment, as he stood lone and
deserted
on the rugged side of that high and towering
hill.
