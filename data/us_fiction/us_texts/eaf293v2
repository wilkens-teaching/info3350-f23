JOHN OMAR TO EDWARD MOLTON
Philadelphia
,
My Dear Molton
,
I have
just arrived. My spirits are depressed; the
weather is gloomy, and I feel myself to be really and
truly alone, in a land of strangers. How will this
adventure
end?Would that I might rend away the dark
curtain, for a moment, and look into futurity. I might
appalled--I
might; but, were it not better to have your senses
reel at once, and all your strength desert you; than to be
cheated, as I have been, year after year, with hope and
disappointment
?
What can I say to you? It is impossible that
I can have anything to write; yet, my heart is heavy with
thought and speculation. I promised to write, and,
therefore have I written. Let me hear from you
directly
.
I shall be impatient for your answer; for I feel as
a stranger here, even in my retirement.
There is one thing that troubles me. But you will
suffer no trifling
there
, will you?Is Grenville serious?
I know not what to think, but I wish you to inform me
of all that concerns him and Juliet. I saw him after I
left you, for about ten minutes. His manner was solemn;
and mine, I fear, rather arrogant; still, there was
something
mysterious, I thought, in his deportment, which
justified me, in a measure. I came by your lodgings,
on purpose to communicate what I had learnt, to you;
but, you had gone out, and I could not wait. The
stage-coach
was just rattling round the corner.
NoMolton. This is a desperate enterprise. There
is no hopeno chance; but, as I have set out upon it,
under
your counsel and impulse, I never will abandon it,
never!until my fate be determined. Yet remember
to-morrow night is the trialand I do not expect to
succeed
.
I have not even hope to sustain me.
Yours, forever
,
OMAR.
P. S.I open this in dismay and trepidationwhat
have I seen?I was hurrying, to the Post Officeand I
could swear that I met the apparition of Juliet,palled
---her veil over her facehanging upon the arm of
Grenville
.
I was thunderstruck. I could not believe my
senses. Explain it to me, Molton?What can this mean?
Have I really seen her?Or have my senses yielded to
the incessant fatigue and agitation, that I have
experienced
?
I know notI see as usualhear as usualmy
memory, too, is as distinct; and I can discover no signs
of excitement about me, except a fierce throbbing of the
temples. I almost touched her, before I saw herand
thenthere was something in her action, that made me
look up. It was that of one, trying to conceal herself;---
she gathered her veil thickly about her face,---and I
thought---perhaps it was fancy----that she had been
weeping. The whole passed off in a moment,---like a
flash of light----but if it was not Juliet Gracie, by
heaven, it was her apparition. She entered a
carriage
that stood waiting for her;---and then only, did I
turn my eyes to the man that was with her. His back
was toward me; but it struck me that he appeared very
like Mr. Grenville. Is'nt it strange?---But I suppose
that
resemblance obtruded itself upon me, in consequence
of my thinking of Juliet. Yet I cannot laugh at it. I
would---I try to---but I cannot. There is a strange
reality
,
notwithstanding the suddenness and rapidity, with
which it appeared, that I am trembling at, yet. The
result is---that I have run into a bookstore close by the
office, torn open my letter, and written just as I felt.
vol. ii. A 2
My conclusion is this---either my senses are disturbed---
or, I have seen a most unaccountable resemblance---
orGracious God!---I will not imagine such a thing.
It were a sure proof of my disordered brain. No---she
is not a woman for such adventures.
Write immediately, if you any mercy on me.
JOHN OMAR.
EDWARD MOLTON TO JOHN OMAR
Baltimore
, .
It was no apparition, my dear Omar. The woman,
that you saw, was really Juliet; not Juliet R.
Gracie
, to be
surebut Juliet R.
Grenville
. She is now the wife of
Grenville. May she be happy!O, my friend, never
did a prayer ascend from my heart with such fervour and
sincerity as thatMay she be happy!
In tears, you say. I hope not. Much may be
allowed
for her timidity, and the suddenness of the affair; but she
is a woman of too high a soul, to permit the simple
terrours
of the girl, to continue so long. She is now a bride
a wife; and there must be no common sorrow at her
heart, if it be visibly heavy at such a moment. I know
little of her husbandvery little. My inquiries have
been satisfactory to a certain extent; that is, I have
heard no serious matter
against
him; but then I have
arrived
at little to convince me that he is the man, against
whose heart, that woman ought to lean, forever and ever.
He should have a great soul; a mind of unadulterate
grandeur, to be the pillow of such a spirit. You speak
of an interview with himand of some mystery. I do
not like that wordit is a bad symptom. Where there
is mystery, there is always guilt or shame. Let me hear
the particulars. Tell me what you said to him, and how
he behaved. I am somewhat impatient; for, the
marriage
was very sudden; and a friend of the family informs
me, that it was more like a funeral than a wedding. I
do not profess to understand it; I had no idea that
matters
had gone so far:if I had, perhaps I might have
interposed; and yet, that would have been childish; for
Juliet is old enough, and wise enough, to choose for
herself
.
Stillafter all, there is a tormenting anxiety
upon my spirits. I want to know
why
they married,
so hastilynay
why
they married at all. To me, it
is a deep mystery. Let them beware, who have spread
the toils for herif there be aught in the affair, that they
would not avow in the face of heaven. She is a
creature
that has been dear to meand I would not
undertake
the retribution slowly, or reluctantly, if she have
been wronged,wronged, I care not how.
You speak of the depression of your spirits. All that
is natural. You are about entering the world for
yourself
.
You are cut adrift; and, in the hurry of your first
feeling, you know not whether you be afloat or
foundering
.
Mark me. Your confidence will soon return. I
have felt the same timidity, the same darkness, the same
irresolution. Yet, it wore off. My dependence was cut
off. I was alone. No matter how weak the prop, upon
which we have leanedwithdraw it suddenly, and we
are apt to fall;no matter how frail may have been the
tenure, by which we were upheld, though it were the
untwisted
flax in the blazeor the tangled gossamerif
abruptly parted, we are in peril. Let a man, while he
is standing upon a precipice, and holding upon a single
thread, or a cobweb, find it yielding; and, it is ten to
one, that he falls;but
snap
it, and he
will
fall! Such is
human nature. Half of our stay and support is
imaginary
.
I remember my own feeling, when I was first let
adrift, dependent alone upon myself. For a time, I was
like one, shipwrecked on a barren rock, sick and alone,
faint and desolate. But, after a little time, my spirit
began
to get up and look about her. I learned to depend
upon myself. I grew surprised at my own strength.
Every movement encreased my admiration and
confidence
.
I looked at my arms; they were strong;at my
frameit was of iron. I measured my facultiesmy
acquisitions
.
Was I not in health?unburthened and
alone? Great God!young, and in health! with nobody to
care for, but myselfit was impious to doubt! What!
were the fools and blockheads about me; the weak and
the wicked; the sickly and feeble of spirit, were they to
succeed; and I to lay me down and die, in the first ditch!
No.
Omar, I pray you to reflect. I pray you to recal my
parting admonition. It is irreligious to doubt. God
never meant that such men should doubt. Nolike
Bonaparte
,
he that is full of blood and pulse, when he
surveys
his object, should precipitate himself upon it,
at once, like a tyger upon his prey. Omar, remember
my prediction. You will succeed. Depend upon it; you
will succeed. But then
then
it is, that I shall tremble
for you. At first, you will astonish. Why? Because
you are a stranger, and nothing is expected from you.
But you have many competitors; persevering some;
unprincipled
and adroit men, some, who have taken the
field before you. Yet the campaign is not over. March
onadopt the plan of Moreau. Do not stop to reduce
every post as you advance. Do not fear to leave an
enemy
in your rear---
that
is the precaution of a coward.
That fashion has gone by. You must not provide for a
retreat. There is no retreat for you. Set fire to your
shipping. You must conquer, or perish. If you
prevail
if!
why do I use the word?you
shall
prevail
your enemies will join you, of course. If you fail-,
it
matters not that a few fortified posts are in your rear.
They can, at best, only accelerate your destruction.
They cannot make it more sure. Remember your
reward---what
were you doing here?Nothing. Every
hour, you became weaker and more wavering. You did
right in going.
Any
enterprize were better than
idleness
.
It will raise you in the estimation of her, that is dear
to you.
Had you rested here a little longer, you would have
been overlooked; nay, you would have deserved it? Shall
you succeed? Yesbut do not be impatient of your
reward
.
Remember that there is a long life of discipline,
toil, experience, and trial, for you. What would you do
with a wife now? Are you not more helpless than a woman?
Where is your profession? Your security? I speak not
of your talents;for I cannot speak of them, without
appearing
to flatter you. But, with all the talent in the
world, there must be an established business habit,
before
you ought to think, for a moment, of hazarding the
happiness of that woman. Noyour sentiments are
right. Your promise was noblemanly. You ought
never to return here, but with reputation and money.
Then you will come clothed with beauty and strength.
Then
, I will embrace you, with all my heart and soul
Let me never see you
here
, on any other condition.
But---as I have before said, I do not tremble for you,
now. Your time of peril is to come;---your season of
trial, and doubt and dismay. At first you will astonish;
you will carry all before you. But the enthusiasm of
the hour will die away. Reaction will follow. You
will be dealt with unkindly and coldly. Your real
merit, for a time, will be overrated. Too much will
be expected of you; too much said. In the nature of
things, you never can astonish the world a
second time
.
You will be less warmly cheered:more coldly
criticised
and
your heart will reel in its perplexity and
darkness
.
Then, will be your time of peril. For that
period
,
I tremble. To it, I look with alarm and
apprehension
.
I know your temper. I know to what aliment it
is accustomed. To one so enthusiastick, the dry
business
manner of the Philadelphians, would be cold and
uncomfortable nourishment But prepare yourself. Expect
to fail. You do expect ityou will ariseNay, while I
am writing this, you have arisen; and, feeling that you had
every thing to gain, and nothing to lose, you have
acquitted
yourself like a man. Do you remember the
despondency
of Wolfe? He wrote to Chatham, that he was
sure of nothing but failure, and death.
Therefore
did he
succeed; and,
therefore
, will you succeed. When a man
has brought his mind, steadily, to the contemplation of
disaster, humiliation and death, what else can disturb
himFarewell, dear Omar.Let me know, immediately,
he result.
Yours
,
EDWARD MOLTON.
FRANK TO JOHN.
New-York
, .
I have just time to inform you, my dear brother, that
the affairs of Ramsay, Dalton & Co. are not quite so
desperate
as they were supposed. I am ready to leave town,
however, for a distant place, where, I hope, by
strenuous
exertions, to arrest a conspiracy, that I think
ruinous
to the estate. The gig is at the door;and, if you
do not hear from me soon, I beg that you will attend to
the matters here, in person. I may be, possibly, on my
way to Jamaica, but shall leave a power of attorney for
you. Sarah, I suppose, will write to you. At present, I
think that I may saythat there will be something
tolerable
left for her, even though all the doubtful debts be
reckoned desperate. But if the Jamaica house stand well,
poor Sarah will be an heiress yet.There is a report
here, that Juliet and Grenville have run off. It is a
ridiculous
story, I confess; but how should it be invented,
here? Who knows them? I heard it from a perfect
stranger. Can she have been imprudent enough to
travel with him? Tell me all that you know of the
matter
,
dear John, by return mail, directed to me at Boston,
where I shall stop for two or three days, at the most.
Good bye
,
FRANK.
JOHN OMAR TO EDWARD MOLTON.
I have succeeded!thank heaven, I have succeeded.
I can hardly keep off my kneesmy heart is in my
mouth. The particulars, I must communicate at some
future time, when I canat present,I cannot.
Farewell
,
JOHN OMAR.
JOHN OMAR TO EDWARD MOLTON.
I wrote you a single line yesterday, to inform you of
my success. Nothing ever astonished me so much.
Whence was that preternatural confidence? was it
desperation
?
It was. I am interrupted.
You astonish mebut I have not another word to say,
now that she is really married.
What a singular adventure! I must
communicate
it to you. You know that I once paid some
attention to anatomy; and there is no science, which may
not be made subordinate to this, in which I am now
engaged
.
I have found it so, already; and, willing to
refresh
my memory, a little, I put myself in the way of the
following mysterious affair. At the house where I am
boarding, is an eminent surgeon, with whom I lately had
a consultation, respecting an extraordinary rupture of
the vessels, about the brain, from a slight blow. What
I said, seemed to have made some impression upon him;
for, he repeatedly renewed the subject; and, yesterday
morning, invited me to accompany him on an expedition,
which, were you less of a philosopher than you are, I
should be unwilling to communicate to you. The mind
shrinks with loathing and abhorrence, from the rifler of
the grave; no matter, under what pretence; and, he who
has ever been in a dissecting room, and witnessed the
brutal ribaldry; the incredible indifference, with which
the bodies of men, women and children, the beautiful and
the strong, are cut up and disfigured, will never think
of it afterward, but with a palsy of the heart. Yet
such things are necessary; and, perhaps, an affected
levity
may sometimes prove the best antidote to
squeamishness
,
or reluctance, in the youthful. Ridicule, we know,
will overcome the shamefacedness of most people; and
why should it not, the heart-sickness? Sentiment, or
delicacy, I confess, are out of the question. The hand
of the operator should not relent, while he is severing the
most delicate entanglements of the heart; noto do his
duty, he must rend and tear the loveliness before him,
like a beast of prey. But, whither am I wandering?
The interest of science, however, will not satisfy a
brother
,
a father, or a husband;it is no consideration to
them, after one, that they have loved and worshipped,
has been exposed to the offensive levity of boys; that, after
deaththe body of woman, is like any other eartha
moulding of clay, only, from which, to be sure, the black
blood flows, when the knife hath penetrated it deeply.
Well, this gentleman is a stranger here, an adventurer,
like myself; and, from what I can learn, a very
extraordinary
manone of God Almighty's scholars, as
Ferguson, the astronomer, called himself; a being,
self-taught
,
self sustained. Heaven protect and prosper such
men! I say. It is on them, that we are to depend. Their
riches and power are inward, and inexhaustible, and
indestructable, except by that hand which gave them
tincture
,
impulse, and spirit. On such men, the common
calamities
of life have no influence. Poverty, shame, and
dishonour; reproach and humiliation, are but so many
medicines, to quicken and invigorate their faculties.
But, to the storyor, I shall ramble forever.
The professor invited me to the Potter's field, or
publick
burial ground of this city. The faculty go here, as
to a market; and the sexton's shambles are openly
accessible
,
at all times. The day was cold; and we rode on
horseback, that we might return, as speedily as possible.
While we were in the sexton's hovel, a handsome gig
rattled up to the door, containing a lady and a gentleman.
Both were elegantly dressed, and of a genteel appearance.
The sexton appeared surprised; and we caught the
sentiment
from
his
face. The man alighted, and handed
out the lady, with extreme caution. He then produced
a small square box, and paid the fee for its interment.
Said the sextonDo you wish to see it buried, sir?
The reply was Yes!I will accompany you, myself.
Will you not come to the fire? said the sexton, to the
lady.She bowed, and a few words fell faintly from
her lips; and she drew her black veil over her face; and
came and sat down by the fire. The seat was near the
window, through which she could see the interment. She
sobbed deeply, but strove hard to conceal it. Judge of
my sensation; to see a mother attend, in
such
a manner,
the funeral of her babe,
the day after its birth
; conveying
it, secretly, to the charnel of a great city; sitting on a
bench, made of coffin boards; (fact!) and warming
herself
,
by other shattered remnants of the same kind,
blazing
in the fire place. I shuddered, for myself, for
human
nature, for woman kindwhen thus convinced how
far the brightest and the fairest may be sullied and
defaced
,
by familiarity with man. Worse than all, were
my sensations afterward. The professor bought the
box, within ten minutes of its interment, and brought it
to town. We opened it, and found the body of a lovely
babe, which had been violently handledperhaps
murdered
;
and, in the coffin, was a paper, in which it had
been wrapped; on it, was the name of the father, who
little thought, I dare say, that he would ever be
discovered
,
on earth. He is a man of property;a married
manthe head of a family. What should I do?I
would have had him arrested, within an hour, could I
have established his guilt. No moreat present.
By the way, you know something of my antipathy to
old maids. Many a time have I wondered at your
seriousness
in their defence. The thing is no longer a
mystery
.
I have found one here, that used to be an
acquaintance
of yours? Nayperhaps it is the very woman,
for I believe that your favourite was a Bostonianshe,
of whom you used to speak so reverently. Is it true?
Is she that noble creature, full of dignity and sweetness,
who, when her heart was young, saw its lord perish;
and deliberately, voluntarily, and without any
clamorous
sorrow, devoted herself to his memory---loved his
spirit---resisted all the fascination of life, without
becoming
morose, or melancholy, to the view of the world;---
widowed herself, and loved on,like one that cannot love
but once?
Is
this the woman? She appears very
amiable
and intelligent; so unaffected too, that she speaks with
the most natural and pleasant air in the world, of leading
apes
hereafter
, in preference to being led
by
them,
here
.
The story of her life is like that of her, on whom I have
heard you dwell with such pride and emphasis.
She
lost
vol. ii. B
her beloved one in his youth. She was rich,
accomplished
,
and full of talent,sought after, on all sides;yet
she had the calm, beautiful steadiness of devotion in her
love;its memory was a religion,its object, a martyr,
a disciplean apostle, whom she could not abandon.
She refused many an offer;and is now alone, cheerful,
and beloved; courted on all sides. How different from
that strange masculine woman, whom you brought so
speedily to her bearingat madam Hartley'sa
woman
whom, were it not for your high opinion of her mind, I
should most cordially hate. But you know her better
than I; and, I am willing to believe, that the darkness and
desolation, which are about herher lonelinessand
strengthhave made her what she is. O, would that
she would keep watch and guard upon her temper. She
would be less terribleand more welcome even to her
dearest friends. Yetlet me not speak disrespectfully
of her. She is of a family, whose daughters were men
and whose sons were more than men. Can it be
wonderful
,
that she should, now and then, exhibit her strength
upon these
he
-creatures, that thrust themselves in her
way? I remember your first meeting with her. I smiled
then;for I saw, by the colour of your eyes, that she had
gone, exactly far enoughthat there was a settled purpose
in your heart. But I smiled more, when I saw her
attempt
to put you aside, as she did other men. I knew
that, if you awoke, she would tremble, in every joint, at
your aspect. Yet you forbore. I loved you for your
forbearance? Butit did not continue.I am sure that
it did not; else how have acquired you this mastery over
her? Your dominion is settled and established. I am glad of
it,because, I perceive that you respect her; and I thank
you for teaching me to speak more reverently of her.
But how different from this woman! Enoughsince I
have seen
her
, I have discharged all the colouring of my
heart,that pity, dislike, and almost hatred, which I felt
once, for old maids. I find that a woman may be single
and somewhat old; yet dignified, charming, and
intelligent
.
And now for Grenville. By the waya letter from
FrankHe has heard of Juliet. The story goes, that it
is
an elopement!I shall write to him, immediately.
YesI will, while I remember it, relate my
conversation
with Mr. Grenville, that evening. I must be very
brief though, for I am continually interrupted. I was
abrupt and direct, as I usually am, when I am in earnest.
I asked him if he was
serious
in his addresses. I thought
that there was a smile coming up in his face,but he
repressed
itand his forehead darkened. By what
authority
,
young man, do you make the inquiry? Do you
consider me accountable to you?
I do
, said I,
without
hesitation. He looked surprised; and a silence of half
a minute followed, as if he were afraid to trust his voice;
at last, he said, more calmly than I could have said it, I
am surenay, almost as calmly, I do believe, as Edward
Molton would have said it. I am ready to answer
your questioning, when I know, precisely, your
authority
.
Are you a relation? No. Her friend?
Yes. Her lover perhaps? Sir, said II do not
shrink from even
that
question. I
am
her lover. He
turned paleand the fire flew out of his eyes.
Understand
me, said I, I
am
her lover, I have been, ever
since I knew her;but I am no favoured lover. But
I have a brothera stout-hearted brother, who would
die for herthe vessels of
his
brain shall not be ruptured
causelessly. Tell me what you mean;come to the
point, at onceI do not wish to hurt your feelings. I
would avoid a quarrel;but my brother is away; and I
I, only, am the guardian of aa, my voice
trembled
.
He seized my hand. Young man, said he, I
respect you. I will therefore answer youI will
even anticipate your questions. YesI
am
serious. I
do love Miss Gracie. I will marry her, if I can. This
is all that I can tell you. Whether I have any reason
to hope or not, I cannot communicate to you;farewell
---you have disturbed meyou will know, for a
certainty
,
within a few days, in what relation we stand to each
other.
There, my dear Molton,---that is all that passed at the
time that you speak of; but there was an agitationan
embarrassment in his manner that, to me, heaven
pardon
me for the uncharitable thought---to me, looked
suspicious and mysterious.
Farewell.---I have not forgotten what you said. I
shall persevere;---and, I hope, trim my little bark so
gallantly
that, whether she sink or swim, whether she scud
over, or under the water, the people that see her shall
cry,
well done!
. I shall try to write to you to-morrow;--at
present, I am so pestered with attention, that I cannot
look about me. So it isbut, as you saythe wind will
change, and I must be prepared for it.
Yours, ever
,
JOHN OMAR.
MOLTON IN REPLY.
Be not surprised, my dear Omar, if you do not hear
from me for a week to come; nay, even if I meet you,
in Philadelphia. I have a scheme in view, that will
tear away, or detect the mystery of which we complain.
It is even said
here
, that Juliet ran away. I am
astonished
at the report; and, though I find that nobody
believes
it, yet all repeat it. How can they reconcile such
things to their consciences?What! repeat, and give
currency
to what they do not believe themselves!nay, to
what they know to be a lie. Alas, poor human nature!
This reminds me of our disputeSuppose the story
truefor, it is even said that Jane turned Juliet out of
doorsor shut them against her, which is the same
thingsuppose the story
true
. Yet some that have told
it, believed it to be a lie. Is it not true then, that one
may tell the
truth
, and yet, at the same moment,
be guilty of
lying?
Certainly. The heart may lie. So, one may tell
a falsehoodand yet speak the truth. It is enough for
him, if
he
believe what he say. It matters not, whether
it be true or not. If he believe it, he speaks truth; if he
do not, he lies, whether what he says, be true, or not.
That woman, Jane, is at the bottom of thisif she be
Omaryou never heard me
threaten
that is not my
wayI may bite, but I never bark. But if Jane
be
the
doer of this iniquity, it were better for her that she had
never been born. I have her completely in my power;
to a certain extent, she, herself, is sensible of thisbut
O, she knows not the tremendous truth. You will soon
hear from me, or
see
me.
Direct to New York,for, it is possible that I may
pass through Philadelphia, in such a hurry, as not to be
able to see you. I have some things to do, yetbut they
won't detain me long.
About the child. Beware of
that
secret. It may be
a matter of life and death to you. He, who could bury
his babe, where he must have known that its little frame
would be searched, through every filament, and fibre,
vessel and nerve, with the dissecting knife a married
man, tooa father!he must be a murderer in his heart!
Beware of him. The ends of justice may not require
you to move; if they docall on me. I will stand by
you, whatever may happen. But rememberif he be
in fact, a murdererhe will never rest, till he hath
strangled
the secret in your heart. It were a less crime to
stifle and suffocate
you
, than his own child. On the
contrary
if
he be powerful, married, and the head of a
family, the portentous secret must be buried. So
unless
you go, at once, unto the hall of justice, and impeach
the wretch for murder,you had better be silent. Nay
my advice is, that you be silent. The hand of God will
be upon him, night and day;the beautiful babe
blackned
and defaced by his blasphemous hands, will lie
forever
upon his pillow,with its little purple lips touching
hisand sweet eyesweltering in their first tears
and the blood settled about its pretty throat. O God,
Omarfor ten thousand worlds, would I not see a
creature
of
my
loins sitting upon my pillow with that look!
Ten thousand murders,---the sacrifice of many men---
were less terrible, less frightful than that!---The
innocent
,
the helpless,---our own dear hearts in miniature---
our thought, and pulse and passion clothed with flesh.
vol. ii B 2
O, it were putting our hand profanely, upon an image,
fresh from the moulding of our God;Who could
lacerate---who
could deface it!.--A father!---no---no devil
could do that--no leopard, in his wrath, would tear his own
young. No---it is impossible. But if he have---why
let him
live
. Let him live!---that were more terrible
than many deaths. Let him live, and hear nothing but
the continual sob of a strangling infant;---see nothing,
but its pretty hands quivering in agony,---its little eyes
dim and blood shotand be eternally haunted with
beautiful dead children.
Farewell---but, before we part, remember that there is
to be no slumber to your eye-lids now. If you faint---
lift your eyes upward---outstretch your hands to the sky.
The earth is not
your
mother; nor will you find your
strength renewed by contact with her. Remember---the
strong man slept, and had well nigh perished. He, that
could pluck down temples upon his own head, had well
nigh perished, as a child, in his imbecility. He was shorn
of his strength, sleeping. And he, that cables could not
have fettered, in the lordliness of his unimpaired strength,
was well nigh imprisoned with loose flax. Swift has the
same moral. Lilliputians are able to bind a giant with
cobwebs. Thus is it with the minute and swarming foes,
that inhabit the heart of man. They spin their manacles
of something finer than cobweb; but they are doubled,
and doubled, till they have assumed the tenacity of
established
and confirmed habit; and lo! we are their
prisoners
!
Would that you could have heard a sermon that
was pronounced before me, not an hour since. It went
to my heart. The preacher stood up, as one having
authority
.
His deep voice; the thrilling solemnity, the
unaffected
and awful steadiness of his eye, while he uttered his
denunciations; the impassioned fervour of his look, when,
with clasped hands, he called aloud upon his Father in
heavenOmar, you could not have heard it, without
coming away a better man. I, even I, upon whom the
language of the pulpit, hath fallen for years, like a
continuity
of unmeaning sound, upon the senses of a
sleeping
maneven
I
was aroused and agitatedalarmed!
The sermon seemed as if meant for me. I know not why;
but I thought that no one, who had not known
me
, and
my
life and history, could have rained such blows upon my
heart, as he did. The loathsome and fiery plague spots,
upon it, reddened to their centre, as he breathed upon them
but the effect has been healthful, and salutary. A giant,
said he, may sleep. A giant may awake---and, beholding
destruction uncovered before him, may be more a giant
than ever. He who hath faltered, or turned aside from
his course,
may
outstrip his competitors;
may
run faster
and further, than if he had never wandered or loitered.
But who shall say, to what unattainable point, his course
had been limited, had he always run for his life; battled,
night and day, with his passions. It may be, that he will
die a better and a greater man, for having sinned early,
and desperately. But wo to him, that adventures on such
a sea. The shipwreck of mind and body, is in peril;
nay, the shipwreck of the soul, with all its freight of
immortality
.
And, after all, the forgiven and repentant
sinner, even in heaven, will lift up his hands and say,
that it were something better never to have sinned at all,
than to have sinned, and been forgiven.
He was
right
.
Omar, such are the doctrines that man should preach.
We are not to wrangle our lives away about mysterious
and questionable points. They are not meant for
discussion
.
But there is a religion, a vital and inherent
religion
,
in the heart of man, that will appear, when
invoked
gently, and in simplicity. Say to the four corners of
the earth
Do as ye would be done by
it is the
essence
of all religion; and the four corners of the earth
will ring with hallelujahs. God never meant that aught,
which is
capable
of being misunderstood, should be
essential
.
All that is clearly taught in the scripture, is clearly
important. All that is not so, to my view, is just as clearly
unimportant. Do you remember Dr. Mason? You have
heard him. You know his overbearing, arrogant,
Johnsonian
way. A mighty man, a Philistine, he may be, in
theological warfarebut this,
this
that I heard from his
own lips, wicked as I was, and am, made me look up to
the roof, while the words were yet sounding in my ears
almost in the expectation that it would fall in upon us,
in thunder, and dust, and smoke. Said hethere are
a kind of people in this world, who have a sort of
qualified
reliance upon themselves; and others, who have the
same qualified dependance upon their Saviour. Both
unite in the belief that, hereafter, all their own
deficiencies
in holiness, may be made up out of the Saviour's
stock. Let me make it familiar to you. Such christians
are a sort of merchants
they draw drafts upon God
Almighty
;
and, fearful of their being protested, they get Jesus
Christ to endorse them
. Do you not shudder? I do, Omar
I do;yet I heard Dr. Mason use that very
illustration
,
and almost those very words, in his own pulpit.
Yet,
he
is a great man;
he
is of the orthodox. Heaven!
what is the true meaning of impiety?---blasphemy?---and
what is toleration in the religious?---a mere name,
synonimous with weakness.
[1]
[1]
This Dr. M. is the man, who, after denouncing all that should associate with Unitarians,
In a late sermon of his, as rather worse than them, who keep company with the damned;
threw down the book, left the desk, and went, straightway, to the house of Mr. Taylor, the
Unitarian clergyman, of Philadelphia, and took refuge there, for the night.
Ed.
The religious, no matter of what belief, Mahometan or
Christian, Pagan or Jew, are always tolerant or
intolerant
,
exactly in proportion to their weakness. The
feeble
are always clamorous for toleration. The strong
allege
,
that toleration and indifference are convertible
terms. But enough---that is a theme, upon which I do
not often lay my unconsecrated hands---but when I do, I
am carried away with it. The truly religious, I
venerate
.
Right or wrong, the honest man is always the
religious man, to me;---and, right or wrong, I hold
myself
bound to respect the scruples of a tender
conscience
.
Do you remember R's definition of orthodoxy and
heresy? Orthodoxy is
my
opinion---heterodoxy yours.
How simple, yet how bitter, is the truth! It reminds you
of the lunatick that we saw. What!---are
you
confined
here?---and for what? said you. Because I am mad,
said he. Mad!---you! O yes, he replied---it was
a question for the majority. I maintained that all the
world were mad; and all the world maintained that I was
mad. They were the majority, and they put me in here.
Had I the power, I should have done the same with
them.
Yes---the lady, of whom you write, is
she
, of whom I
have so frequently spoken to you. Cultivate her
acquaintance
.
She is an honour to her sex. Nay, Omar, let me
urge it upon you. You are young. Accustom yourself
to the society of virtuous women;---the first symptom of
degeneracy, in man, is a dislike to the company of such
women. Give to them their true weight in society. Let
nothing induce you to detract from it. Support them
with all your power; have compassion on their
infirmities
;
and remember that, in proportion as you diminish
the influence of woman in society, you diminish the
influence
of virtuenay, of all that is beautiful or
endearing
in life.
I have thought of a scheme for you. Have you much
iron in your character?---and constitution? Can you toil,
year after year, for a distant, and not absolutely certain
object? You are young---ardent---not averse to strife.
What say you? All South America---all India, is open
to you. Were I a few years younger---or were it not,
even as it is, for
one
thing, which hinders me from
undertaking
any enterprise, which may not speedily be
accomplished
,
I care not at what peril---I would embark this
hour for India. I have thought a great deal of the
matter---a
great deal. I know the jealousy of the British
powers; but I know also the hatred and dissension that
are among them---the resources and population of the
country---every province of which is an empire;---and I
would undertake, with the labour of a few years, to
overturn the British empire there. You smile---come to
me, and you will smile no longer. You will no longer
regard the thing as ridiculous. Come to me, and I will
put charts, tables, manuscripts into your hand, that will
convince you. Omar---
nothing is impossible to a man of
resolution and perseverance
. The scheme may now sound
like the speculation of a madman. Yet, I am not mad.
I reason as coldly and as closely as ever. Give me a
problem to solve, and I will go about it as steadily.
What then?this. I have learnt to have confidence in
myself. I can look back five, six, seven, and eight
years of my life; and I find myself now, where, if I had
then
been heard to say that I should be, at this time, I
should have been thought a madman. Omar, it would
be a less rise for me, for the next ten years, to be the
king of some Indian province, than it has been, for the
last six years, to cease to be what I was, and to become
what I am.
Adieu

EDWARD MOLTON.
JOHN TO SARAH.
Why do I not hear from you, dear Sarah? How do you
employ yourself? Have you heard of Juliet's marriage?
What do you think of it? Molton is on the track of
something
.
I know not what; but his look is that of a
bloodhound
.
Frank told me to write to you; but I know not
what to write; my heart is sore and full, and all my
veins feel distended. I have had certain severe trials, of
late; and have just begun my professional career. Has
Frank written you that the affairs of your father look
more promising of late? He says so; and he is rather
cautious in such matters. He is gone to Jamaica. Let
me hear from you, immediately. Do you want any
money
?
Say so, without any scruple, if you do. It shall
be remitted, at once. Have you heard from Juliet, since
her marriage? If you have, and she has told you all about
it, I entreat you to let me know the particulars, without
a moment's delay.
You are, probably, astonished at the composure, with
which I speak of Molton, after all that has passed; and
Frank, I know, is. He reproached me, bitterly, in a
short note; and almost called
me
an accomplice in
William's
murder. But why should I be wrathful with him?
We want mercy, and shall we not show it? Beside, on
what ground am I to complain? His own confession, it
may be said. But, by his own confession, he is
not
guilty
of murder. What did he? O, heaven, Sarahit
is
hard to believe it; but such is man!he did no more than
I, or any other man would have done, in the same
situation
.
So, I have forgiven him. Nay, moreI love him
more than ever. I feel a companionship with his
infirmities
.
I pity him. He is lowered, to be sure, in my
veneration; but he has come infinitely nearer to my heart.
There is humanity in him, now; for he is weak and
passionate
.
Before, he was something preternaturalcalm
immoveableindestructible.
Farewell
.
JOHN OMAR.
P. S.A long letter from you!the servant has just
handed it to me. I have no time to answer it, having to
run away this moment; and, as I may be prevented
to-night
,
I shall send this, just as it is, by to-day's mail; and
make a formal answer, as I can, hereafter. Molton, I
suspect, means to have an interview, which will try some
of our acquaintances, rather severely.
EDWARD MOLTON TO .
Upon my word, you will never be satisfied, I am afraid,
till I have convinced you that you are a blockhead!in
matters of poetry, I mean; for, as a man of good
understanding
,
and fine taste, not natural, but acquired taste,
in other matters, I shall always regard you. But why
put me to the trouble of telling you such a disagreeable
truth? Will nothing content youand Mr. Walsh, and
the
present
conductors of your
North American
, but
to be told, in downright English, when poetry is the
subject
of your conversation, that you don't, any of you,
know what you are talking about. Why not keep to
what you understand? Why not be content with the
reputation of good sense, and excellent judgment? Why
drive a man to an absolute demonstration of your
insensibility
,
in all matters of feeling and passion?
You can't agree with me, in my estimate of Mr.
Percival
,
or any body else; and you cite the opinion of
Robert Walsh, Jr. Esquire
, against me. Very well
I can bear thatI only smile, and hold my tongue.--
But unhappily for you, my silence is
misunderstood---misinterpreted
.
You think the authority of Mr. Walsh has
concluded me. You drive me to a defence of my opinion;---
an explanation of it---although you well know, that I do
nothing at the halves; and that, if I think a man a
blockhead
,
I never hesitate to say so, whenever I think it
worth my while---be he who he may.
Mr. Walsh, I am willing to think well of, if you will
let me. But beware how you attempt to convince me of
too much. The testimony may recoil. Mr. Walsh is
mistaken about Mr. Percival. So are you. So are the
present conductors of the
North American
. As for
Mr. Walsh, he wants the poetical sensefor it is a sense
--the natural feeling for poetry.--So do you.--So do they.
Yet I ought to make one exception. The review of Mr.
Percival, in the January number of the North American,
for 1822, although very cautious, and constrainedis
witty and original, and take it altogether is a capital
article for
that paper
. But that for 1823what shall I
say of that? It is altogether too wise and thoughtful
too ridiculously emphatickas if it were the job-work of
some writer, who had just good sense enough to know
that, if he did'nt manage well, he would make himself
ridiculous
,
and ruin the author whom he wished to befriend.
The first writer is a tolerable judge of poetrythe latter
is a blockhead.
But Mr. Percival is called a
great
poet. Ridiculous.--He
is a beautiful poet, and that is all. He is
passably
deep;
gentle, tranquil, and uniform. You are never amazed,
never
alarmed, by anything that he does. He never says
anything positively foolish, absurd, or extravagant. It
is impossible to make him ridiculous, by a parody, or a
travesty. Can
he be a poet, then? Nohe cannot.
But let me tell you what he isand what his poetry is.
He is a man, who never would have been a poet, or
attempted
poetry, of his own head, had he been born away
from poetical men; or beyond the influence of their
example
.
He would never have thought of poetry, for his own
consolation, and still less, for the consolation of another.
In one wordhe is not a
natural
poetalthough he has
a very pure, but timid and fine sense of poetry. So
much for the man. Now for his poetry. It is a
buried pond of warm waterburied in the woods
unruffled
never
turbidnever noisynever tumbling about
but always teeming with pleasant shadowsbirds
water-lilies
cloudstall
green treeswild flowers,
floating
aboutand shining fishsilentbut not with the
silence
of a natural solitudedeep, but not with the
unsearchable
depth of the ocean.
You love Percival. So do I. I don't know him; but,
he is a bold hearted fellow; and I can't help loving any
man, right or wrong, who has the courage to tell men
what he believes to be unpalatable truth. Truehe is
affected
with melancholy, I meanand so was your
William B. Walter; and half a dozen others, who have
a notion, that other men would like to be troubled with
what they call their
woes
the extremity of which, in
all probability, has been a head-ache---a few hours of
foolish despondency---self reproach---or a cholicka dun
or a criticisma slight, at a dinner partyor a cut
director a disappointment in love or ambitionthe love
of a simpleton, who had no relish for the abstract and
poetical part of a manand the ambition of being great,
where it is always most difficult to be greatamong
one's playfellows.Alas, for such men! and alas, for
poetry
!for
them
, if that be all that has come of their
being
gifted as they are;and for
it
, if that be all, that it
brings with ita spirit that will not be comforteda
heart that cannot be contenteda mind that keeps itself
from repose, by continual goading; as if it were the sign
of a vulgar nature, to be satisfied, in any degree, with
any thing in God's providence; and as if, to be happy,
were to be unsentimental, and prosaick.
But you
praise
Mr. Percival, more than I. And so
does Mr. Walsh. And yet, quere to that....Both of you,
it is true, use finer words, and more of them; and call him
vol. ii. C
greater
, than I do. But, I doubt much, if he
himself
,
would think your praise greater than mine. The fact
is, that
you
both want the poetical taste; and he is aware
of it. I do not---and, all that he gets from me, therefore,
will go to the right place. It will do him good. But that
which you are so prodigal of, depend upon it, is more
likely to trouble him, than to make him better satisfied
with himself. He is obliged to endure it, to be sure.
But why?---because Mr. Walsh is the editor of the
National
Gazette
---and you have great influence with
the world of fashion---which has
all
influence with the
North American
.
To
judge
of poetry, or of any thing, indeed, a man
should be a
workman
, at the same trade. But if he be a
workman at the same trade, it will never do for him to
find fault with the work of another---ah no!---
that
, no
matter how just it may be, or how evidently well founded,
will always be attributed to
envy
. Two of a trade can
never agree. So that, if a man be truly a judge---he
cannot criticise impartially---he must not. A critick,
therefore, must either be ignorant of the subject---or he
must
praise
it, whatever may be the merit of it.
Believe me, sirthere is no blast, like untimely
approbation
;
no censure so fatal, as the injudicious praise
of men, who do not know where, nor when, nor what to
praise. It is ten to one that you blunder upon something
that the author has stolen,or that, he, himself, knows
to be so bad, that, if you were anything of a poet, you
must have denounced him for it. In the first placehe
damns himselfin the next,
you
.
Mr.
Percival
knows that he is not a great poet
:---and,
I have no doubt, pities the men that call him so, at the
same time that he is offended, at their insensibility to what
he
is
a
beautiful
poet. Stay, a momentI have a
question
for you. Are you prepared?You love his poetry
you are familiar with it. You have read it allnow,
think well, before you speak.
Can you remember half a
dozen thoughts, or expressions out of all that you have read?
What! are you amazed at the question?or does your
heart fail you?---or your memory?---your
memory
, per
haps you will say, is bad. Nay, nay, man, never attempt
to get off, with that plea. A
great
poet will be
remembered---in
spite of your memory. You cannot forget
him. In every page, notwithstanding the trash and
dross, and emptiness and rubbish, there will be some
imperishable
,
indestructible thought, that will engrave
itself
like
a legend upon your heartlike the motto of a
hot coin upon wax. Nay, open the book---open, where
you will---and point me to, if you can, a single thought
of
greatness;
or to many of even
uncommon
beauty. That
is a hard judgmentbut it is an honest one. Perhaps
you will call it envy. Very wellcall it envy, if you
please. Envy will always defeat itself; and, if my
judgment
have aught of envy in itthe world will find me
out, and punish me for itand think the better of him,
in the long run. Let him be assured of that; and, if he
oan persuade himself that I envy himlet him!---I am
perfectly willingit will be a comfort to him. Let him
pity and forgive
me
, as I would, any man that should
trouble
me
in the same way.
But let me go through with what I have undertaken,
which is, to show that
Mr. Walsh
, and the
North
American
do not understand poetryand that,
I
do:
that, it is perfectly ridiculous for any of you to pretend
to talk about it;and that, I do not despair of making
you feel that it isnor of making you
acknowledge
, that
whatever else you may be, you are not made to sit in
judgment upon either poets or poetry.
I have read the first number of Mr.
Percival's Clio
but I have never been able to get the second, although I
have seen an extract from it, which contains the most
beautiful thing that he has ever done; it is in the
Coral
Grove
.
The water is calm and still below
There, with its
[2]
[2]
There, with
a
waving blade of green, would be altogether
better
.
Its
ought to be avoided, particularly in poetry.
waving blade of green
,
The sea-flag streams through the silent water;
And the crimson leaf of the dulse is seen
,
To blush, like a banner bathed in slaughter:
There, with a light and easy motion
,
The fan-coral sweeps through the clear deep sea;
And the yellow and scarlet tufts of ocean
,
Are bending, like corn on the upland lea.
There, my friend, the words that I have underlined
have more true poetry, and a thousand times more
beautiful
originality in them, than any thing else that I have
ever met with, of
Mr. Percival's
. I remember one other
thought of his, however, that I will mention here,and
then, away with quotation. It is in the poem on
Consumption
.
And there is a blending of
white and blue
,
Where the
purple blood
is
melting through
,
The snow of her pale and
tender
cheek.
Now Mr. Walsh would never believe, that the essence
of that thought, the beauty of the whole passagelies in the
simple word
tender
and that the wordsnot in italicks,
are altogether beneath poetry. Not that they are
prosaick
,
or out of placeI do not mean thatI only mean
that the poetry is not
there:
and that the other words,
italicised
, are, though beautiful, not half so remarkable,
as the word
tender
in that placeit is like the
tender
green, of the new earth. It is really wonderful, how
instantaneously
and happily poetical thought will fashion
for itself, a correspondent language. Here the poet let
his heart have her own wayhe had been touched by the
thought, while standing before, or sitting by some sweet
girl, dying in a consumptionand he had there seen the
purple
blood (which, by the way, is
bad
to any ear
not classically familiar with the
purple
of the ancients;
for, with the multitude,
purple
is not a blood colournor
a bluebut a deep violetAlthough the ancients
meant everything and anything, just as Byron does, by the
same word)
melting through it
he thought then of the
snowstained, very faintly, with blood;and, the
language
arranged itselfforthwith, so as to be touching and
innocent, like the thought. And so it always must be.
Poetical thought does not seek for rhymebut it always
will seek for peculiar expression;it has a sound of its
ownrejecting the more barbarous of our consonants:
and delighting in melody and gentlenessor smoothness
and strength, even when exalted to sublimity.
The first volume of poetry that Mr. Percival (by the
way---he was never a lawyer, I believe---although I
have often heard that he was) is made up of little pieces
and large ones---put together, between the ages of
seventeen
and twenty-five, or twenty-six. I have just read
it; and I am very sorry for it. It has lowered him,
beyond
all belief, in my estimation, as a poet. I can
forgive
a child for attempting poetrybut I cannot forgive
a man for publishing it. No matter, at what age the
poems were writtenit is enough for us, that they have
been published by the author, when his judgment was
mature. That is a very just criticism, take it for all
in all, which
first
appeared in the North American; but
it does not go far enoughit is too timid and irresolute;
wanting in discrimination, patience, and dignity; and
what is more, the author was too much inclined to
kindness
and pleasantry, for the occasion:but, be that as it
may---he was a fine fellow----a much finer one, believe
me, than any other one among you, who dares to talk about
poetry,
now
, so far as I can judge from your late
numbers
,
which I sometimes meet with. A great part
of
Prometheus
, I do not scruple to say, is not only
as
good
as the major part of Childe Harold, but so
like
it, that I should have pronounced it to be Byron's
without hesitation. Mr.
Percival
, it is true, can walk
like Byron---on his midway journeying;---but he cannot
go up aloft, like him, and steady himself among the
clouds:---nor does he ever grovel so brutally or stupidly
as Byron. Let Mr. Percival do his
best
---and I should
say, at a glance---no! that is not Byron. Here is another
hand writing. Let Byron do
his
best, and I should be
certain
,---instantaneously certain---that nobody but
Byron
could have done it. But let them both philosophise---
Byron in his
own
way---and Percival in Byron's way---
and I would defy any man to tell which was which, as
vol. ii. C 2
we say in New England. Byron's legitimate dominion
is a desert. It is the barren, rocky, silent
dwelling-place
of a stern shadow---an enchanter---who hath
forbidden
the winds to blow---the waters to run---the clouds
to pass over him---or the grass to spring up under him---
lest they might disturb him in his incantations. The
territory
of Mr. Percival, for it is not a dominion---he is
absolute
no where---is a beautiful, and vividly green
tufted
place, all alive with water courses, and parted off, by
flowery hedges---into inexpressibly pretty solitudes, in
miniature---where, if a man mean to be alone---he must
stick his head into the bushes, and stop his ears; where
there is nothing awfulnothing that will make a devotee to
the solitude chant, or pray, under his natural voice---but
everything, to please a fellow that don't like getting
wet---or muddy, and yet is fond of green silent places;
and the finest echo in the world, for repetition, and
prolongation
of low and complaining musick.
There is not a single ode, song, or sonnet; nay, not a
single passage or thought of striking beauty, or peculiar
character, in all the poetry that I have yet seen of Mr.
Percival's, which I cannot
prove
to be an imitation of
somebody or other, who has preceded him;and
generally
,
of Byron, Campbell, Milman, and even of some of
our Amercan writers. For examplethere is, in the
first number of Clio, an ode to Greece, which is altogether
after
Byrona song, about some raval victory,
actually
made up of the battle of the Baltick, (where the
boldest held their breath,) and the Mariners of
England
;
several songswhich are downright imitations of
Moore;and many other passagesmany pagesafter
Milman; particularly one, which
is
beautiful
insupportable
to me, as all imitation iswhere he has taken
Milman's
Italian Wife
, (
Fazio
,) and distilled it into a
page. These plagiarisms are not of language, or
expression
,
so much as of thought and mannernay, many of
them are hardly to be called
plagiarisms;
and ought to
be mentioned only in proof, that the author has no strong,
prevailing,
natural
character of his own, or he could not so
readily, and would not, so fondly and continually,
assimilate
himself with the character of every other poet that he
gets a glimpse of. It is this facility of adaptation, which
will prevent Mr. Percival from ever becoming a
great
poet; and which, if he be not upon his guard, will finally
ruin him for a beautiful one. Nay, that I may not leave
anything for conjecture, I will say the whole at once.
Mr. Percival
is not a poet
. You are amazedyou smile;
and so does Mr. Walsh. But I rely on the opinion of
Mr. Percival's reviewer(the first one, I mean)He
agrees with me, that, to be less than a
great
poet, is to
be nothing at all. And this cannot be denied; for,
exactly
in proportion to the pleasure that we receive in
poetry and musick, when they are the
best
; is our
intolerant
reception of whatever is less than the best. In
matters
of the understanding, it is not so. We can endure
tolerable sour breadbut tolerable sweetmeats are
intolerable
we
can bear up against pretty good water,
but pretty good wine is a little too bad. We can
endure
bad talking---but bad singing is insufferable, just
in proportion to our fondness for what is good. Nay---
to talk of
bad
poetry, or
bad
musick, or
bad
eloquence, is
to talk of what, is a contradiction in terms.
Believe meMr. Percival is an
artificial
poet. God
never meant that he should make poetry. At least,
such is my opinion for the present;and is founded
upon
his having kept the secret of his powerif he have
power---so
long, that any man would be pardonable for
doubting it.
But you may ask where these imitations appear---
and demand to see them---more particularly. Sir
there is no answering such a demand. If you do not
instantly perceive the counterfeit---no reasoning will
convince
you:---You cannot be
made
to see it---because you
must be made to see, at the same time, your own want of
judgment hitherto; or, at least your own blindness. But
surely, you will say---if these imitations are so plainly
to be seen---anybody may be made to see them.
Indeed
!do
you know a counterfeit bank note, when you see
it? Can you make anybody, and every body, see that it
is counterfeit? You can see an imitation in this man
of some other man, whom you know, in his voice, tone, or
gaitcan you make it evident to another
can you
describe
it?
No. Nor can I describe these plagiarisms of
manner
in Mr. Percivalthey must be felt, instantly
or not at all. I feel them, I see them. I am pained and
mortified continually with them; and yet I should
despare
of making anybody else, but a
poet
and a poet too,
familiar with
all
the moderns, perceive them.
But what do I think of
Byron
? you say. Really, my
dear sir, I hardly know what to say. I am weary of
talking about that man. I think that, as a
poet
, he is
not to be compared with little Tom Moore. But, as a
dramatistas one, that understands the passionsand
gives to poetry just the place that it is entitled to, in
describing
their operation, he is superiour to any man
that I can now call to mind. Byron shows to you, the
very thing itselfthe poet only shows the counterfeit:
one is all factthe other, all illustration. Byron takes
you, by main force, to the base of the pyramid, and
commands
you to take its altitudenot by measuring the
shadowbut the substance. Not so with the
poet
he
fatigues you with resemblances. But Byron's tragedies,
you will think, are sad examples of dramatick talent.
Very
true. They are a sort of barbarian metaphysicks. But
I appeal to his early poems; the finer creatures of the
brain, begotten while his heart was in fusion. Then, he
was all passion, directness, and scorn, heartfelt scorn,
of the empty creatures that beset him. Then he had
little
or nothing to lose, and every thing to gain. Now, it
is exactly the reverse. Now, the kingly drapery that he
used to wear, is nearly worn out; and he clings to it, with
the desperation of one to his wedding suit, when he has
only that left, to remind him of his bridegroom-days,
when all the world took hold of hands, and danced round
him, as round an idol. Byron's
talent
is prodigious---
his
imagination
neither brilliant nor delicate, but strong
as death---
taste
, so, so---
sentiment
, burning---
industry
,
great, very great, for a poet and a lord.
And now, for some of the other great men of the day.
In the first place, I would have you know, that this age
is, emphatically, the age of poetry; and that,even our
common
newspaper poets throw out finer poetrywithout
knowing itthan is
ever
to be found among the heavy
volumes of ancient poetry, numerous and wonderful as
they are.
Your
Wordsworth
tickles me, prodigiously. He is
a great, plain-hearted, august simpleton. A gifted
creature
of
prodigious power: a devout dreamer, who
cannot
,
for the soul of him, tell when he
is
awake; a strong
man, with the organs of a child; whose ample and
profound
thought, can find no correspondent diction. He
thinks like an angel, and talks like something less than
a man. He is a giant---blind of both eyes---and deaf as
a post---who has blundered, somehow or other, into
Nature's
laboratory---and there goes, groping and
rummaging
about, most unprofitably for
himself
, among all the
beautiful elixirs of immortality, and crucibles for
transmutation---wading
into oceans of uncongealed precious
stones---ploughing through heaps of rough gold, hardly
cool from the furnace---waking strange, subterranean
musick, at every step, as he tumbles along, first one way,
and then another, among the sources of sound, and
harmony
,
totally insensible to all, one would think; while
the very dust that he brings away upon his garments,
never fails to enrich those who have the first scouring
of them, and picking of
him
---a matter that keeps a mob
of retail dealers in poetry, watching after him, as they
watch, in China, after people who are seen to make wry
faces;and when they get him in a corner, they never
fail to beguile him of his old clothes---heavy with
unknown
spoil---and wash him clean, even to the hair of
his head---all the time talking baby-talk to him, and
profaning
his
simple majesty
, with all sorts of idle and
wicked mockery. In short, Wordsworth is not a little
like the lump of fresh meat that Sinbad foundrolling
about among diamondswounding and tearing itself
continuallywithout any profit to anybody, but the
creatures that grew dizzy in waiting for him.
Wordsworth
is altogether a natural poet. Education has done
nothing for him, except to make him tedious, childish,
obscure and metaphysical. His
talent
is more
sublimated
,
simple, and clear-sighted, than that of any other
man---
sentiment
, angelick---
imagination
, altogether
subordinate
,
quite common-place---
taste
, too pure,
periodical
,
subject to accident, time, place, and the moon---
industry
,
none at all---misunderstood and misapplied.
Rogers
.I hardly know what to say of this
gentleman
.
He appears to be an amiable good-for-nothing sort
of a man; who declaims downright, incorrigible prose,
with such a look of gentle, inward self-satisfaction, that
it would be really cruel to laugh at him. And then, too,
at times, the man has such an imploring countenance---
such a deprecating tone---that you cannot find in your
heart to tell the truth of him, or of his dandy poetry, to
his face. But Rogers---heaven be praised---is altogether
a
made-up
poet. No
imagination
---no
talent
---pretty
taste
, and agreeable
sentiment
---good
memory;
and a
stomach
like an ostrich---intellectual stomach, I mean,
which can digest anything---find aliment in anything---
and convert anything into what he calls poetry.
Southey
Is a natural poet; but altogether destitute
of tenderness and sweetness. He is gifted, largely, with
a kind of power, that is entirely his own---the power of
making great poetry, appear common-place; and
common-place
poetry, great. He has been too adventurous
---I do not mean, by soaring too high---but, by wandering
too far. His course has been sidelong, downward,
backward
,
onward; any way, but upward, for a long time.
Ten years ago, he might have been one of the two or
three great poets of the age. Now, it is altogether too
late. He had a great capacity; but he took in a cargo
of inflammable air, for ballast; carried too much sail;
and is now in a fair way of abandonment to his old
underwriters
,
for a total loss. More
imagination
than
talent
;
but his
imagination
is rather wild, flighty, beakish,
and heavy, than beautiful or eagle-pinioned---
talent
,
rather
solid than showy---no
taste
at all---
sentiment
,
hercick
,
but too epick.
Campbell
.Were it not for
Hohen-Linden
, which
was a fine accidentand great, absolutely
great
, only in
one stanza(By torch and trumpet fast arrayedis
the one that I mean;) and
Lochell
, which is a miracle;
and about a dozen linesnot morehere and there,
scattered over his
Pleasures of Hope
; and a part of the
Mariners of England
, so remarkable for its warlike
simplicity;I should point to Mr. Campbell, as the finest
specimen that the world ever saw, of the
artificial
poet.
And, even as it is, with all these exceptions, I am not by
any means convinced that he has a downright, natural
passion for poety. That he has a good, sound,
discriminating
judgment of poetry, in the abstract, I cannot deny;
but he wants fire, tenderness, simple grandeur, and
sensibility
.
He has all the outward expression, look, and
carriage of the poetthe gentlemanly poetbut I do
hold him to be badly off, for that inward instinct, which
I do not know how to express better, than by calling it
Shakspearean:
that intuitive, unlabouring, prompt,
unthinking
,
headlong aptitudequicknessand delicacy of
perception, which makes the truly poetical nature,
talk
poetry, in spite of itselfjust as Shakspeare doeswhen
and where poetry is entirely out of placein the deep,
deep drama,I do not mean in the
descriptive
, but in the
narrative
, and
active
drama. Poetry can be
endured
in
dramatick
description
now and then;but, in
dramatick
narrative
, it is wholly out of place,--and, in
dramatick
action
, absolutely abominable. We can bear to hear
a
description
, in tolerably poetical language---in a
general
way---of the
general
effect of being heart-broken;
but when one goes about
narrating
a particular case, we
wince, at every departure from simplicityand quiver
all over with suspicion, or dislike, at the appearance of
poetical ornament;---but, if he go one step further, and
attempt to show to us---by
acting
---that his
own
heart is
actually
breaking before our eyes---we cannot believe---it is
in vain that we would try---we
cannot
believe---that he is in
earnest---
if
he talk poetically.
In short---Campbell's poetry is the poetry of the brain,
not of the blood. To my notion, it is the strange
product
of a strange poetical alchymy. Some one has been
trying experimentsin the bright chambers of poetry
while the apparitions were away from their blinding
labaratory
and
the issue has been, a material, that
without
being either diamond or gold in reality, has all the
weight of the one, and the glitter of the other. Very
fine
talent
pure and solidnot malleablenot fusible:
little or no
imagination
rather a man of
intellect
than

frightened, and more easily disheartened

,
unexceptionable

, worthy of all praisewithout
being profound or continual.
Milton
.
[3]
[3]
Or rather,
Mr. Milton
for your well-bred, gentlemanly critick, in America, never
forgets
the
title
of a man.
A great manbut much learning hath
made him mad. He was far too learnedand reasonable
for a poet. He was of that ancient school, who
wrestled
,
and ate, and danced, and slept, in their heavy armour,
that it might not be an incumbrance, on the day of
battle
.
He is never without his weaver's beam, and
ponderous
helmet. At every tread, he crusheswhat he is
continually calling upon us to admirethe green, spongy
earth, and the matted wild-flowers weltering in the
light and shadow. If he lean against a treein his
stately enthusiasmor lie, all along, upon the broad,
heavy grassthe tree is barked by the pressureand
the green earth bruised and crushed into barrenness, by
the weight---or scorched into ashes, by the intolerable
brightness of his armour. Sometimes, when his mail
has become too hot for him---he has been seen to throw
it off, for an hour or two---untie his invincible locks---
and leap away, from before you, like a young man just
out of the depth of the blue ocean---strong as a giant---and
naked and beautiful as God's own offspring. Give
Milton
time to prepare---let him know that you are coming
---and, taking the hint, he begins to sit up for company:
becomes little else than a tiresome, pompous old fool
---who cannot ask you how you do, but in some
unintelligible
exhausted idiom; and wears you to death with the
legerdemain of gone-by ages---making up for a want of
that sweet wisdom, which you have come to see---in the
mighty Bard---by a continual display of lofty
nothingness
.
Milton has misunderstood poetry. Various and
universal as it is---there is one character, under which
it never appears---a
learned
one. Fire and water will
agree better together, than learning and poetry. One
is all fact---the other all imagination. One all heat---
the other all coldness. Learning is cold and exact---
poetry hot, loose and careless. Milton had a
magnificent
angel for a guardian---but neither he nor his angel,
had any tenderness of disposition. Both were of that
race, who beget their children by sound of trumpet---
and make love, like unicorns---in broad day-light---with
all the world looking at the miracle. Miton's
talent
was absolutely stupendous---his
imagination
, hardly
third rat
elaste
, classical---but unnatural---and
unfeeling---no
sentiment
at all.
Industry
, respectable.
Barry Cornwall
, (or Proctor.)---The most tender
and beautiful creature of the age. His dialect is pure
poetry---his very idiom---prattle and gossipthey are
all legitimate poetry; he is the very essence and heart of
Shakspeare, before Shakspeare was fully grown. I am
only afraid that he will become too dainty---too tender
---too sentimental. There is danger of it. He wants
nerve---and people are coaxing him, in every direction,
to lie a-bed, night and day, and indite to them. He is a
natural poet---so true---so gentle---so affectionate. His
poetry is of the heart---rather than of the blood or brain.
But, all that won't do. He will pall upon the taste, if he
don't touch us up, now and then, with something more
racy, fiery, and pungent.
Talent
, sweet, but not strong;
---
taste
, exquisite;---
industry
, very good;---
imagination

tenderness
,
and affectionate beauty, than for brilliancy, or
strength;
sentiment
, pure and tender, beyond example.
Moore
.The best trained singing bird that God, and
man together, ever made. He is the first and the
last of his family. There will never be another, who
will whistle, so like naturethrough all the delicate
entanglements
of art. The
Bird-Waltz
was made
for him. No such combination of plumage and note was
ever imagined before;and then, the creature dances;
keeps time with his feet; and gets through the most
complicated
vol. ii. D
minuet, all at the same time, as if dancing were
as natural to him, as singing. Moore makes less use of
poetical language, than any body elsehis words are
never fine, or grandbut always very simple, natural,
and familiar. People overlook that wonderful talent.
Moore is never greatnever altogether naturalbut he
is always happy,
familiar
shining, adroit, and
graceful
;
with the purest notion of song poetry in all the world.
He is the rarest combination of the thrush, linnet,
nightingale
,
and canary;without being like eitherhe
resembles
them all. He attempts, now and then, to fly
perpendicularly upward, into the very skybut he can't
he can't;the golden chain, and the golden spots
upon
his plumage, weigh him down againand he cannot,
though he burst every tiny blood vessel of his little heart,
he
cannot
get beyond the atmosphere of the flower
garden
,
and the beaks of butter-flies.
Talent
, pure gold
little or no fire;
imagination
, exquisitebut of the
insect tribe
sentiment
, voluptuous, altogether sensual;
taste
, unrivalled, for perfection and aptitude;
industry
,
very uncommon; about no. 2, among poets.
Montgomery

man
who
must
be tolerated, wherever you find him. He
is one of a dozenalthough he least resembles the
master
whom
Wordsworth has had the spoiling of;but
he is the only one, who has not grown the richer by it.
No poet, either by nature or art.

Coleridge
.---Here is a precious fellow! His friends
are mad about him---and his enemies
with
him. He was
meant for one of the best poets, that ever went astray---
like an angel, with his wings clipped---among the vulgar
creatures of the earth; until, for so it is, with Colridge
---he had forgotten his own heavenly language, and
learnt the gibberish of the schools; forgotten the
metaphysicks
of the sky, and taken up with the perplexities
of the earth. Heaven help him! His
Ancient Mariner
is a
perpetual wonder---even for its touches of foolishness;
for it is the foolishness---not of humanity---but of
something
divine.
Talent
, dreamy, uncertain, doubtful;---
imagination
, wild, beautiful, strange;---

alternately, divine and earthly---above the highest
---or below the lowest---1000---or less than zero;---no

Milman
A stately creature, who, unfortunately
for himself, was caught young, before he had attained
his full growththrust into a mould, to which he has
grown altogether too scrupulously, as I think. I like
neither your long-headed peoplenor your long-eared
oneswhen they are made by pressure and weight. I had
rather see a man unnaturally crookedthan unnaturally
straight. The first
may be
nature, after all; the latter
cannot be.
Samor
, tedious as it isis a greater poem than
Paradise Lost
. Milman, some how or other, has the
knack of diluting solid goldor beating it, as you would
eggs, into a golden foam, or a vapour. Leaf-gold is not
thin enough for himhe would have it so essentially
combining
with the very atmosphere, that, after any
disturbance
in heaven, he might find it again, if he should want it--
see all the earth sprinkled with it, again.---Pick it up if
you canit slips through your fingers like quick-silver,
or vanishes, like the gold of a butterfly's wing. You are
rich, as you believe, in what you have been hoarding
but when you
yourself
are
pinched
or choose to
pinch
that,
you will find, generally, that there is only a metallick
brilliancy on the end of your fingersa little
humming-bird-dust
at the bottom of your strong box. So with the
poetry of Milmanhis late poetry, I mean. It is
amazingly
beautifulbut very superficial. The language, to
be sure, is solid enoughand there is enough of it. But
the real poetry of thought, is neither weight nor
measure
.

Hunt
is a prodigy. He is a most living supply of
poetry. He drinks it up, as from a fountain. Every
sense is alive to itbut he is getting qaite too dainty and
affected. He has trifled with his gift, until he has made
all his poetical senses, a by-word to other men, and a
torment to himself. He is not a
great
poetand,
therefore
,
if I am right in my doctrine, respecting poetry, as
applied to
Mr. Percival
he is no poet at all. But that
won't do. The proposition must be wrong, which leads
to such a result. I had better see first, what I mean by
great
poetry. Is it grand, daring, tempestuous poetry
or is it,
perfect poetry in its way
. If the former, then
there have been but few, very few poets among men.
If the latter, then are Percival and Hunt, poetsgreat
poetsbecause both of them are very great, in their little
way. So---I take back what I said of Percival. He
is
a poeta
great
poetwithin his natural element;not
great
in dimensions, amplitude, or elevation; but great in
his perfection---which sort of greatness, most people are
best able to comprehend. A
great
jeweller to themlike
a
great
astronomer---is only that one, who is among the
best, at the trade.
Hunt's peculiarity, is a miraculous sense of beauty and
affinity, in language---a miraculous power of
appropriation
.
He goes through the dictionary with a divining
rod---that
will
find every drop of fine poetry, wherever it
may be hidden---and tremble over ittill it be dug out.--
Thus, he tells you of---
the little whiffling tones,
Of
rills among the stones
.---
Where the fountain's tongue begins to
lap
.
And, of
The rounder murmur,
glib
and
flush
Of the escaping
gush
.
Now---a man that had never seen a little fountain---
with the tongue out---like a young puppy---just running
over, by starts, at one edge---would get a correct idea of
it, from that;---and understand just the sort of muttered
musick that would come from it. Hunt is foppish;
affected
and childish; but nevertheless, a most exquisite
creature. Let me state a case.---He wants to describe
the sunshine, after a shower, when the rain fell upon the
dry leaves, like
twangling pearl
, trembling through
the green tree-tops, upon the fine grass below. How
does he do it? Hush!---There was a little
strawy fire
,
he says; a little
golden ferment
in
one
place. Such is
Hunt; full of such queer, lucky, hazardous,
unpremeditated
adventure. My friend---there is one drop of pure
poetry
in the heart of every living creature---but, like the
tear of an angel---which every pearl has within it---it may
never be seen, except on the happening of some poetical
accident. Stop---let me convince you of it. You fancy
that you have a taste for poetry---wait five minutes, and
I will put that drop in motion---and then, you will be
satisfied, from the sensations that follow, that you have
hitherto mistaken classical rhyme---for the musick of
heaven;---the heavy talking of men, that are dead, for
poetry
.
But first, of Hunt---
Talent
of the finest, incapable
of undergoing analysis, escaping in the test---
imagina
tion, unexampled in its fineness, but limited---destitute of
grandeur---
taste
exquisite, unequalled, but apt to be
sickly
and affected---
industry
.
Let me attempt to show you, by this very example, of a
little sunshine spattered upon the grass, the difference
between
several of the ancient and modern poets. I will
try to tell it in the manner of each.
Hunt, you may see, with his head in the bushes;
holding
on by his ruffles, with one hand; looking at the place
with quick, shining eyes, just like a child watching the
progress of a lightening bug through wet, green moss.--
He tells you that there is a little
golden ferment
there.
But
Wordsworth
would say, standing solemnly over
it, all the while, and speaking like one---a very wise man
--trying to make a mysterious thing intelligible to a child.
He would say
vol. ii. D 2
I stood and saw the beautiful wet earth,
Just where the sunshine fell; and then I thought,
Of earth impregnate with divinity&c. &c.
That is enough for our purpose---it is just after his
fashion; but
he
would have gone along, for a whole page,
telling us of renewed vitality---the germinating
principles
of immortality--&c. &c. likening it to that
very
place, just as if he did'nt see how it was possible
not
to
see the resemblance.
But
Rogers
.---There he is. I see him---there he
stands, gently inclining his ear toward the place---his
eyes turned to a great city, that can just be seen, through
the wood---toes out---a nice little rattan in one hand---
his watch chain in the other, in the attitude of one
recollecting
,
rather than uttering, spontaneously, a fine
description---Rogers
would say
That, erst upon a time, the lord of light,
Divine Apollo, from his quiver shot
His golden shafts among the pearly dew, &c. &c.
Southey
would gallop to the spot, on horse-back---
cut a few capers---till he'd got the mob around him;
---dismount---stand
like one, that had
prepared
himself to do
something extempore; and then tell you---either that
Apollo had slain a dragon there---or that a fountain of
fire was about to find its way through the earth---or
that
The showering urn above, had overflowed;
And deluged that dark spot with golden light.
Campbell
would step forward, like one afraid of
wetting
his feet---with a gold and green hunting net over his
shoulder, full of strangled singing birdspull away
the branches, very gently, so as to get a fair shot;---seat
himself, carefully---take out his common place book---
look for the index---word
sun---sunshine---sun-light;
---
and then, taking dead aim for a subject, at the little
golden
ferment
, determine to make it his own, if his
ammunition
held out, though he had to sit there all day long.---
Observe him---he is keeping time with his fingers---and
humming the air to himself---while he is making the poetry
---before he puts pen to paper. Ah!---he begins to write---
very well---onward he goes---no blotting, no blurring---
now---hush!---He is beginning to read what he has
written
.
The thing is'nt finished yet---he must take it home
and polish it up:---at present, you can only hear something
about the quiet place---the tender green---made lovely
by the pale checkered lustre of the day-light---made
doubly brilliant too, by companionship with the
surrounding
shadow---
just like
---that shadow upon our mortal
pilgrimage, which is given to us---even in solitude,---to
make light and harmony more welcome to us.
But
Shakspeare
! What would he say. He!---I'll
tell you.---In the first place, you would find him
barefooted---bare-legged---wet
to the skin---a nest of young
nightingales in his bosom---and live birds all about him
---lying, all along, upon his face---over the great roots of
a leaning, ivy-covered tree---the green, wet leaves
flapping
in his face---the wind blowing his fine hair all about
his eyes---whistling and talking to himself, all the time
---or telling his birds, in their own language, that the
rising-sun had been bird-nesting thereimpregnating
the wanton earth, and heated worldwith his own
lavished
brightness; and that the issue would be a crop of scented
violets, cowslips, butter cupsand dainty field-flowers
such as they might peck at, till their little hearts were full.
He is the poet of nature. His poetry is that of the
blood
altogether of the blood. The little education that he
had, only spoilt his poetrywithout making him wiser.
There is a very wantonness, and, untameable levity in his
imagination, that would have made him the chief of poets
had he lived in a poetical ageand, perhaps, the chief
of dramatists, when weary of poetry. Ah!I had
forgotten
!Little
or no
judgment
no decided
talent
unbounded
imagination
exquisite
sentiment
no
taste
at
all, as the world goesbut the most natural
taste
in
poetrylittle or no
industry
. All that he has written
is not six month's work.
Barry Cornwall
would entreat to remain a while,
and listen to the yearning, in the quiet grassthe gold and
green fibres, intertwining at the very rootlike delicate
tendrils, put out and flowing from the heart of love,
when touched with sudden sympathy---the fire of
ambition
with the young green of first and familiar love. But
Barry Cornwall
would lie there---half asleep, half
sobbing---not at full length---nor in a place where there
was any danger of taking cold.
Milton
.---Let me see. I can hit him off, I am sure.
Wait a moment. He would stand upright, one hand, with a
glove
on, in his bosom---for he is a man that could not bear
to touch his own flesh, nakedly---unceremoniously---
his face, forehead, hair---all set to musick---his voice
deep---far off;---the other hand holding a telescope, tall
as Norway pine, through which he would be
contemplating
the golden ferment---and persuading himself that
there was a war among the constellations of heaven.---He
would tell you---off hand---
That, the rejoicing sun, aloft in heaven,
Again, the voice omnipotent obeyed---
And struck the opaque orb, by men called earth,
Forever teeming planet! and a fire,
Prone, to the centre of the trembling ball,
Insatiate, fruitful, there had lighted up!
And now for
Moore
. He would not come to the
place at all. A drawing of it, would do for him---a
secondhand
sight of it. He would be found lolling about, in some
musical saloon, when the time came, up to his knees
among roses---musical boxes---fiddles---pianos---and
Canary
birds;---thrushes---bulfinches---larks and
mocking-birds---all
tame, tame as death---not a wild bird among
them---not an Eolian harp within gun-shot. Describe
the place to him---and, after a few moments had passed,
during which, he would want you to believe that he does'nt
hear a syllable that you are saying---coquetting and
fingering
all the while, upon a nice little gold and ebony
guitar
,
embossed with seed pearl, which he has persuaded
himself are veritable dew-drops that people get sprinkled
with, by playing early and late, to the nightingale,
half buried in wet shrubbery---he would come out upon
you, with an impromptu---as if he had just thought of it
---words, musick and all---somewhat after this fashion
The sun-shine, that fell
In the midst of a shower,
Will spring up anew
In blossom or flower,
More beautiful far, for the shadow about it;
Like the light of the eye,
When the lashes are wet
With the shadow of love,
That we cannot forget;
A light that is nothing, O, nothing without it!
O, believe me, the ray
That is dampened with dew,
Like the lustre above,
In that beautiful blue,
Is mingled up so, that we never may doubt it!
Then, woman, smile on,
But, unless thou wilt weep,
'Tis the smile of the dead,
When their eyes are asleep,
And we are more touched by the moonlighted rain;
Or, the quick-silver dew,
In the heart of a flower,
Or the dim. gentle light
Of untenanted bower,
Where we look and we listen forever in vain!
We had rather peep in,
When a twinkle is there,
Like feathers of gold
In the rainy blue air,
When the flight of a wet bird is just like a stain.
Then woman weep on---
Pshaw!---I had quite forgotten myself; Moore would
have finished the whole affair, in ten or a dozen
lines---and
I was in a fair way to make a poem of it. He would
have made the parallel, too, altogether more complete.
The first ten or fifteen lines, are very like him, to be sure
---except that he might have said, in double rhyming---
The light fell, like
rain
In the midst of a shower;
But sprung up
again
,
In blossom and flower.
That would have been more
familiar
, and playful
and, therefore, more in his manner; but, the rhyming
would have been false;---
again
rhymes with
men
---except
when poets are hard pushed. Still, however,
Moore would not have boggled at it, although, among the
purest
rhymers
that
now
live;---I do not say that ever
have lived; for, in old times, it was quite a strange thing
to see ten honest rhymes, in the same page.
The next thought---about the tears of the dead---or the
smile of the dead, when the eyes are asleep, is quite too
strong poetry for Moore---except when, by some
accident
,
he has been surprised into it, by the rhyme. He
could not say when the
blood
is asleep, for example; or
when the
mouth
is asleep; but he might, in a gentle
way, have alluded to the
lips
of the dead---of them that
are smiling, like
children asleep
. So, too, the latter part
is better poetry---finer
than
, but not so natural, or so
familiar
as
, you would find in Moore. What I was about
to say, however, (bating that I wanted to compare the
quick-silver dew, in the heart of the passion-flower--to a
gentle sweat--seen only on the shade and blackness of that
flower,) would have been more like him. I wanted to
put a bird into the bower....or a woman weeping; and I
meant to show that the bright plumage
bright
tears---
bright
eyes
bright
breast-pin, (if nothing else would do,
for women will wear jewels, for the sake of the
rhyme
,
whenever they were requested towherever they may be
in bower or bedoverboard or asleepdead or dying)
were all the
brighter
for the surrounding shadow; so that,
on peeping into the dark bower, you would see nothing but
an occasional sparklea tear fallingor a little bright
down, dropping like fire, from the bird, as he sat,
pluming
himself, after the shower; but hang itI could not---
the thought came into my hearthow very like a stain
on the sky, was the flight of a swift, brilliant little bird,
when it flies low; with its red and green, or clear golden
plumage, wet with the rainand in I popped it, as
well as I could---forgetting all the world beside, and not
caring a fig for Tom. Moore---or the business in hand.
Another thing is, that Moore would have shown
demonstrated
so that you could never forget itand
would wonder how it happened, that you had never
thought of it beforethat the process of fructification in
the earthafter the sunshine and rain had fallen upon it,
together, was
precisely
like that of the human heart
when the light of fine eyes, wet with weeping, had
fallen
upon it; and that the flowers of the heart must spring
up, in both places, for every rain-drop, at least, a
handful
of blossoms.
Another fault of Moore'sand a quite unpardonable
one too, in a song writer---nay, in a poet---or in
any
writer
,
is, a
s
ort of carele
ss
ne
ss
, a
s
regard
s
the con
s
onant
s;
Nothing frets a delicate ear, like it. Let me attempt to
avoid it, by a new modification of the poetry above---a
few lines only---so far as it can be done without
affectation
;
and see the difference, then, not only in singing it,
but, in reading it.
The warm light that fell
On the earth, in a shower,
Will come up anew,
In a beautiful flower;
More beautiful, far, for the shadow around it.
But, enough of Moore. Now for
Milman
. After
walking round and round the subject, a day or two,
without coming one inch the nearer to it, continually
intrenching himself as he went, like one beleaguering a
citadel, with blank verse, to be sent in, by a herald
and trumpet, he would heave up his forehead, plant his
feet, and
pronounce
The bright, majestick sun
to be in heaven!
A glory on the earth! A mystery and a miracle!
The solitary gloom and wilderness
Untenanted and dim, about to be,
With trouble and with travel, lighted up
By some foretold conceptiona bright hirth
A sceptred infant.
And
Montgomery
would saythe quiet good soul
that,
Our own heavenly One above,
Had come, in his benignity,
Just like the light of day above,
Quivering through the lofty tree
Taking care to make the
reality
, only a secondary
thought; and the secondary thought, the
resemblance
,
suggested by the sunshine upon the grass, altogether the
principal. So that, one would believe,
not
that the
sun-shine
had suggested the thought of heavenly beneficence,
but that the beneficence of heaven had suggested the
thought of the sunshine.
Byron
would tell youmuttering, to himself
although determined to be overheard, and occasionally
looking under his eye brows, to see who was listening
and sternly regarding the placethat, the earth had
the heart-burnthat, God had struck itthat, it was all
blackness and ashesblasted, to the centrethat, blood
had been spilt there, in olden timeand that, nothing
but fire could purify the place.
And
Scott
would tell youhis neck and bosom all
open, and the wind and mist of the Scotch mountains
blowing into it, till his teeth chattered,
That, through the trees, the downward sun,
Where dark a little streamlet run,
(no matter whether true or notit's only a part of the
rhyme.)
Fell, like a lustre trembling through,
And glittered on the passing blue
Of that mysterious gurgling stream,
In one continual silvery gleam;
And, o'er the stunted grass and flower,
Like moonlight o'er deserted bower,
Showing how fair and desolate
Could be the place where she had
sate
.
There, my dear sir---I have tired myself to death; and
I hope now, that you are convinced of it, by sympathy,
and are willing to acknowledge...that one or the other
of us, at least, is no judge of poetry.
ED: MOLTON.
SARAH TO JOHN.
Waterville, Kennebeck River
.
Really, cousin John, your silence is unaccountable.
Not a line, not a single line, from either of my two new
brothers
, except one, that was almost illegible, from
Frank, written in pencil, upon a dirty bit of paper, which
I had half a mind to smoke, (or fumigate, I must say
now, I suppose, being at chymistry,)---the amount of
which scrawl was, that he was on the deck of the vessel
the pilot just ready to departno time to say good
bye to anybodystill less to write;that you were
worse off, than ever, with Molton---a phrase which I
take to mean, that you were on a footing of greater
intimacy
,
than ever, with him;---and that he hoped all
would go well with you, yet. Just in this state of
suspense
,
came a letter that is utterly indistinct, and
inexplicable
,
from Juliet. Her name is to it, but the
hand-writing
is not hers; or, if it be, she must have been
strangely disordered at the time. All that I can
decypher
,
amounts to this:---
vol. ii. E
Dear Sarah---Do not believe a word that you hear.
Trust to me---to me, alone. Believe nothing, that does
not come to you, in black and white, signed with my
name. I shall write to you, the first moment; but, at
present, I have no time. I am sick---sick at heart,
Sarah
;
but I put my trust in heaven. Farewell.
Whatever
you hear, remember, I charge you, to disbelieve it;
no matter from whom it may come---no matter how
plausible it may appear---until you hear from me.
J. R. G.
On looking again at the signature, I am inclined to
doubt it. She usually signs her name Juliet, but here
is her name at length--and then, the whole is obliterated,
and her initials put over it. Indeed, I am sure, on
examining
it, that the name first written, was not
Gracie
What it was, I know not---some trick, I suppose; and I
shall give myself no further trouble about it.
Tell Juliet, however, that we may meet again, after
all; and, on much more comfortable terms, than we have
lately expected. I have good reason to believe that the
estate is not so desperate as we feared. O, I must not
forget to tell you of a new freak, that has got possession
of me. I have taken up my drawing again; and I mean
to continue it. There is a man here, no great things I
imagine, who advertises, at the tavern, to teach drawing;
and some of his sketches, that were obtained for me, are
singularly spirited; yet they have not the air of an
experienced
or confident hand. At any rate, I shall be
entertained
;
for, his appearance is rather favourable, and
his manner much above that of the people about us. In
such a place, so barren of incident, you cannot imagine
what a bustle the appearance of a stranger will create.
That, which I caused, has not yet entirely subsided; and
now, his arrival, though he has been expected, it seems,
for a long while, from some of the viliages lower down
the river, Hallowell or Augusta, has electrified the whole
population. All the girls here, and there are multitudes,
indeed, are devoutly engaged in the subject He teaches
writing, too, in some short hand way, by machinery,
perhaps---(for some of the yankees teach grammar by a
machine; and others, by a map;---I have seen them both,
and they are truly wonderful and
useful
contrivances.)
Do you remember an invention, about the size of a dumb
Betty, that was in New-York, once; the inventor of
which, called it the Pedagogue;a child of five years old
could work it, by turning a crank;it would keep a
large school in orderwhip the boys, rule the books,
and mend the pens. The principle, I think, was
Lancasterian
.
But enough of this nonsense. I have begun
the study of chymistrytaken up my Italian, and Botany
again; and thus, by a fair division of time, between them,
and this drawing masterO, I forgot to tell you that he
takes likenesses in Indian inkI shall be continually
employed
.
Send me any books that you can, anything new;
you know what I want, by mail. Tear off the covers,
and they travel as pamphlets. I learnt this secret from
an author.
The drawing master has just left me. There is
something
in his appearance that reminds me of somebody, I
can't, for my life, tell whom. His name is Randolph.
He converses well, but with the most astonishing
rapidity
.
I foresee a good deal of entertainment in his
company
;
and he seems very anxious for my favourable
opinion. At least, I judge so, from some little
trepidation
that he manifested, as I took off my eyes, after
looking
at him steadily, just now, for some moments. I love
to look into people's faces, when they are talking:it
appears to me that I can read their hearts, then, in their
eyes. Another symptom that I discoveredO, the
vanity
of women!was that, look up when I would, from
my work, for I was drawing when he came, I always
found
his
eyes rivetted upon mine. There was a strange,
troubled, wild expression in them I thought; but it soon
passed off; and, before he left me, we were on the
pleasantest
terms in the world. But, let me try to describe
them. They are, as I have told you before,
strange eyes
.
I do not know another word in our language, that will
express anything like what I mean. They are not wild
nor beautifulnor
very
brightnor awfulnor
melancholy
;but,
on the whole, are so altogether unlike
any that I have ever seen, as to deserve exactly, I think,
to be called
strange eyes
. Under the lashes, which are
neither heavy nor dark, there is a continual shadow and
ripplealternations of light and darkness, of exceeding
vivacity and suddennessjust as you may have seen
bless me! how extravagant I am getting!I shall forfeit
my New-England character, foreverjust, for all the
world, like the shadow of a willow-tree, over deep water;
shifting, incessantly, from exceeding brightness to a death
like dimnessand then, instantly, all its depth
illuminated
again, so that you can see the population swarming
about, and all the clouds of heaven passing, and
repassing
therein! In short, there is
a bright blue, rippling
glitter
, (as Milman has it, when speaking of heavenly
armour,) continually issuing from under his droll-looking
eye-lashes, when he is much excited. Don't tell Juliet
this; or, if you do, please to add the antidote;he has an
ugly profile, and a sad pale face; andand, I do not
think him exactly the most fashionable young man in
the world. They say that he is from Boston. He
looked
at my drawing;---and, as I confess I expected, for
you know that I am a little vain in that matter, and
particularly of my colouring, since what Signor Petutti
said to me---he appeared a good deal astonished. Yet, he
made no scruple to point out the faults. Thought I, to
myselfyoung man, let me have a peep at yours; and
see if I be not a match for you, in criticism. Good bye.
He is certainly intelligentand, when he is talking,
rather
handsome, I think; at least, his face is animated,
and incessantly changing.
Love to Juliet. Tell her to write to me, immediately,
without grace; and, as for you, at your peril, keep me
informed of all that is going on between Grenville and
her.
Yours, my dear cousin, as you behave
,
S. R.
P. S.I have done signing my name at length. Juliet
has taught me more prudence. It would be an awkward
thing, if any of my letters, with my signature, should
miscarry.
S. R.
vol. ii. E 2
JULIET TO SARAH.
Yes, my dear Sarah,
I am married
. A new state of
being, full of obligation and solemnity, is open to me.
The man that I have chosen---nay, I can hardly say that
I have
chosen
him, for it seems rather, as if heaven, in
its compassion to me, had thrown him in my way, and made
it necessary for me to fly to him for protection,---is a
man of integrity---and talent. We were married
precipitately
;
and, I assure you, my dear sister, very
unexpectedly
;
yet, at present, I am not at liberty to
disclose
the transactions that led to it. I should be sorry
to suspect him, of having countenanced any part of them;
and his conduct has been so uniformly respectful, and
kind; so affectionate even, that if he have had any hand in
them, I am persuaded that it was out of tenderness to
me. Perhaps he may have permitted something of
cruelty
andnay, this is a manner unworthy of me, either
as
his
wife, or as
your
friend, Sarah; and so, I shall say
no more about it, until I can relate all the particulars.
You will hear that I eloped with Mr. Grenville. It is
not true; nor, would I take the trouble to contradict it,
were there not some other reports in circulation, which
would seem to corroborate
that
. Naythe very
improbability
and extravagance of a story have been to me,
heretofore, a reason for believing that there must have
been some foundation for it. For, when people invent
a falsehood, you know that they generally try to give it
an air of
probability
.
You will hear also, that our marriage was private,
and unexpected.
That
is true. Four hours before it
took place, there seemed little likelihood, I declare to
you, that I should ever be the wife of Mr. Grenville.
Would you believe it?There are some cruel
slanders
in circulation respecting me, the extent of which I
have no kind, good-natured friend to inform me of.
Perhaps
,
I may get them more directly from you. Tell me
what they are, without fearing to wound me. My heart
is not easily wounded of latecontinual laceration has
destroyed its sensibility. It is nearly callous. Of one
thing, however, I may venture to inform you. You
know my reluctuance to marriage. I intended to live
and die, alone. Yetsuch was the humiliation, the
cruelty, that I have experienced of late, that even
marriage
,
marriage with a stranger, was a relief to me.
You must not doubt Sarah, that I love my husband. No
had I not loved him, I never would have married him,
under any consideration; but, no matter how much I had
loved him, had I been left
free
to choose for myself, I would
never have married himnever! He knows this. I
have used no concealment with him; and he has married
me, I verily believe, from a feeling of heroick
generosity
.
He was willing to be my friendmy dearest friend.
He deserved to be; and there was but one way. We had
often reasoned of the pastthe present, and the future.
I respected him for his honesty; and, perhaps, loved him,
because he loved me; and, because there was such a
considerate
delicacy in his love. He was never obtrusive---
never capricious; and throughout, had dealt with me
like an honest man. But now we are married; and I
shall endeavour to make him happy. Ah, my dear
Sarah! it is, indeed, no light natter, this undertaking
to be the partner of another, in heart and spirit, forever
and ever. I tremble, when I think of it; and I should
sink into the very earth, if I could reproach myself with
any concealment. But nothere is none---
none
! He
is master even of
some
of the wretched slanders, in
circulation
against mebut he has the magnanimity to smile
at them,ahmy husband calls me. I will return in
a moment
Sarah! I have scarcely the power to hold my pen.
That man, that bad manhe, whom I never meant to
name again
Molton
, has been with us. What can it
portend? Several hours have passed; but, I am yet so
agitated, that I can hardly keep my hand upon the
paper
.
When I entered the room, he stood fronting the
door. He bowed, without any emotion. Mr. Grenville,
I thought, manifested a good deal of perturbation. Mr.
Molton asked me, if it were true, that Jane had shut her
door against me; one evening when Mr. G. and I had
been taking a walk. I answered, reluctantly, yes.
Madam, said he, I do not come to alarm you. My
errand is one of peace. I have been conversing with
your husband, and I respect him. (It was said with
emphasis; and, coming from Edward Molton, I confess
that it did my heart good.) I was not surprised to
learn from him that you had communicated the
whole
,
the
whole
, madam, that ever transpired between us. This
was wise. It will prevent misinterpretation, slander, or
unkind feeling, hereafter. I was willing to see you once
more;but I chose that your husband should be present.
You have been slandered; and I have my share, I find, in
the calumny. For myself, that were nothing, but while
I have breath, JulietMaMadamMrs. Grenville, I
mean---no human being shall breathe any slander upon
your
name. Pardon meI see that it distresses you;
but, I have the traducer in my own power. Your
husband
did not know the extent of these atrocious
calumnies
,
until I communicated them to him. For some
things, that
he
did, I blame him; but, these were
consequences
that he could not foresee---and his loveand love
madam, where it does not debase, enables and consecrates
like divinityhis
love
made him wander. Farewell. I
shall probably never trouble you again. You have both
an ill opinion of me. I am sorry for it; but I do not
blame you; and it is hardly worth while, at my age, and
in my state of health, toSir, your wife had better sit, I
think(Indeed I could hardly stand) to disturb the
consciences
or the hearts of them that slumber--unless, indeed,
I were sure that
they
would be the happier for it. You
will not see me againbut you will hear from me, in
a few days too, I hope. Farewell.
He passed my husband, who shook him cordially, very
cordially by the hand;---and as he passed mewhat could
I do-it was probably the last time-we had never parted
before
,
even in our anger, without it. I put mine into his.
He appeared surprised---touched--and he relinquished it,
very gently. What am I to think of this, Mr. G. said
to me---the first words that he spoke. Is that the man
Juliet? I stammered a little, I verily believe;---but,
nevertheless
,
I was able to articulate a faint
yes
, at last.---
By heaven! said he---he is a most extraordinary
being
.
Farewell! Sarah. Tell me what to do, or think.
JULIET R. GRENVILLE.
P. S. You see a little ostentation, I suppose, in the
name. I cannot help it. I want to get accustomed to
the whole length of it---to the sound and sight of it.
EDWARD MOLTON TO GEORGE STAFFORD.
Once more, dear Stafford, I find myself in communion
with you. My heart acknowledged the approximation;
and it began to vibrate with unusual spirit, while I
was tracing your name. I have experienced much since
I saw you,
much
to weary and chafe a nature like mine;
and something, perhaps, though not much, to darken it.
One thing I have learnt, in bitterness; and that is, that
there is a resisting power within the human heart-- a
sort of
incompressibility
, which renders it stern as
adamant
,
when it is beset, alike,
on all sides
. At a single
shock, it quivers to the core; to a slight pressure, it yields.
But, increase the pressure;---repeat the shock;
---encompass
and envelope it, all about, with an atmosphere of
fire, and heaviness; and it beats boldly and freely again---
like something alive, in the deep water---or our pulses
in the wind. What is the property, that upholds us, at
such an hour? Is it that God hath given to us, hidden
and secret energies, which are only to be developed in
desperation? How many have died in imbecility, who,
had they been taught to wrestle upon a precipice, had
been giants? Our facultieswhat do we know of them?
Do they not spring up and lighten, against oppression
and darkness; yet perish away, and wane, under the more
gentle and delicate ministering of the elements? No,
Stafford. To become acquainted with our own strength,
we must be put to it, for life and death. No man ever knew
the use of his muscles, till he had fallen from a steep,
and caught; been thrown overboard, or shipwrecked.
We can't learn to swim on a table. Make a creature
desperate; and who can withstand it? The mother in
her ire; the wild beast in its wrath; the tamest creature
of the farm-yard; how formidable it will become, when
the instinct of its power is disturbed. So is it with us.
And it were impious to complain of those trials, which
have given manhood and aspect to our virtues. Without
affliction; without trial, discipline, and sorrow, where
was there ever a great man?or a great virtue? Not
upon this earth. The strongly rooted are only known in
the strong wind. The great men of the world, are those,
who have arisen in her tribulation. They are sparks,
elicited by the concussion of societyconvulsed and
shaken to its foundation. Let us not complain, then, my
dear Stafford, if
we
are visited with somewhat that gives
dignity to virtue. But let me leave this. I am now
engaged
in a serious enterprise; and, as I have
promised
one
or two letters of this sort, it would be well, I think, to
remember them now, lest any accident, such as I have
lately escaped from, should incapacitate me.
But first, let me reply to a postscript in your last,
which I overlooked; probably, because it was written
on the very last fold of the paper. You ask what I mean
by calling all your classical writers,
cockney-writers
.
Hear my answer. In the first place, your
cocknies
are
in the habit of dropping the
h
in pronunciation. So do
your classical writers. Let me convict them, out of their
own mouths. All of them are continually writing
an
before
words beginning with an
h
aspirated, as
h
erald,
h
eroick
,
h
ouse,
h
arlot,
h
eaven, &c. Now this could
never
have happened(for men write by the ear, more than
by the eye; and those, who write rapidly, often say
two
,
for
too
, or
to
and form
al
ly for form
er
ly, and
vice versa
)
unless they were in the habit of
pronouncing
these
words, in conversation, 'erald, 'eroick, 'ouse, 'arlot.
Talking
-cocknies are bad enough, heaven knows;but
what are
writing
-cocknies, who have time to deliberate;
and ought to know better? I cannot forgive
them
.
But, perhaps, you may think this an exaggeration.
Try ittake up any book that you will, from Shakspeare
down to, tostop, here is
Crabbe
. Now, I defy you
to open a page, without finding one or more of these
bow-bell-provincialisms. There!what did I tell you?
Here I find
an
'oliday;
an
'elping 'and;
an
'ouse;
an
'ill,
(for a hill;)
an
'uge 'igh 'ouse;
an
'eart, &c. &c. Very
well. Now, let us open the Bible. I take it down from
the shelf. I open it, by chance. I find, almost without
looking for itfor my eye is attracted by such a thing,
just as by bad spelling; or by a letter turned upside down
a city standing on
an 'ill
. There is Burkethe great
Burke. I open at a letter to Charles Lee, Feb. 1, 1774.
I already have
an
'igh esteem, he says. Let us try
Bacon. Men
an
hungred, i. e.
an
'ungered, do love to
smell hot bread, says he. Now open Johnson's
Dictionary
look
for the illustrations of any word, beginning
with
h
, and tell me if I have been too severe. Thus
much on that head. I proceed to allege other examples
in proof. It is exceedingly common with your classical
gentry, ancient and modernbut, especially, with the
modern, and more particularly with the poetical class
to say
wert
for
wast; sate
for sat;
drank
for drunk; and
some other words, about as barbarous, for others purely
and beautifully English.
Dryden
says, or
said;
for latterly, they have
discovered
the blunder, and arrested it, at the expense of the
rhyme;
Aloft in awful state,
The godlike hero
sate!
Byron
still perseveres; and so do several of your
moderns
,
particularly
Moore
and
Barry Cornwall
; and
all of ours, who, like Mr.
Percival
, are addicted,
grosly
,
to Byron. By the way, you have a she-poet among
you, with a more brilliant plumage, and a finer song, by
far, than any female that I ever heard of---and far
superior
to most of your males. She is the author of
Legends
of Lampidosa
---and is called Mrs. Lehman, I believe.
Byron
too, and all of that school; nay, about nine out
of ten, among all your poetical writers, ancient and
modern
,
are in the continual habit of saying they had
drank
,
for they had
drunk
---Thou
wert
lovely, for thou
wast
lovely; corrupted from a beautiful use of the subjunctive,
wert
thou lovely: and more than one, too, are in the
habit
of blundering, forever, in the use of the verbs to
sit
and to
set
---to
lay
and to
lie
. Thus, Byron writes
lay
,
instead of
lie
; for a rhyme, too, in one of those
magnificent
stanzas, in his disorderly apostrophe to the Ocean,
at the end of his fourth canto, of
Childe Harold
.
And dashest him again to earth---there let him
lay
.
Who knows, but some future commentator may reform
that; and make the line terminate in
lie?
It, or
something
very like it, has already been done, with Dryden,
we see.
Another of the cockney-tricks, continually practised by
your great men, is thiswhenever they are puzzled for
a rhyme, they change either the
pronunciation
of a word,
the
tense
, or the manner, from solemn to familiar; or, from
familiar to solemn. They will make
wand
rhyme with
handwrath
with

the solemn style of
thee
and
thou
, for
all
occasions, they
cannot bear to follow it up; are willing to say
thou art

or
thou wilt
but not,
thou shouldst
or
thou wouldst
; but
you
should, or
you
would, as more manageable in poetry.
Such men will say, for example
Thou art

And
should you

Does this appear so very absurd? By heaven, I can
point cut more abominable sacrifices to an indolent
temper
,
in any poet of your country.
I next charge all of your writers
all
I make no
exception
,
with a total disregard to the niceties of
punctuation
nay,
with having
no law at all
. Dr. Blair,
himself
,
has no steadfast rule; and, as for the rest, they
point their own writing, in such a manner, as to prove,
that they have never thought upon the matter. Men
may differ, to be sure, in
style;
but, they may as well
differ in orthography, as in punctuation.
Another common blunderwhich is only a refinement
upon
cockneyism
, among them, is of the following kind.
An abandonment of the infinitive, for some round-about
modification. They never
say
, for example, when they
mean
, that a man expected
to be
at a place;but always,
that he expected
to have been
; and so, too, although I
admit
that
to be quite an unsettled matterthey are
always
blundering in the subjunctive mood. They say,
if he
was
, if he
is
, when they mean, if he
were
, if he
be
.
The best rule perhaps, without regard to the future, is
always to use the subjunctive mood, whenever there is
any
degree of doubt or uncertainty implied, or expressed,
if you can;
in other words, to consider the word
if, unless,
although
, &c. as a sign of the subjunctive mood; in which
case, you will not be troubled, once a year, with an
exception
.
Another pretty trick of your classical people, is that
of leaving out the relatives, as they would poison, from
all their preparations. Blair is at the head of them, who
prefer writing nonsense, to writing
which, that, whom
and
who
. Not many years ago, there was a foppery,
somewhat like it, very prevalent in the world of
shopkeepers
,
play-wrights, merchants, and manufacturers,
whose English is quite another language from the
English
of other people. They left out the pronoun
I;
and
fancied that they could not be egotistical then, by any
possibility
They
would write, for example.
Dr. SirReceived yours of 10th ult. Happy to
apprise
you. &c. We laugh at that; but is it, one tittle, more
impertinent and foolish, than Dr. Blair's practice of
leaving
out the relative? He would say, I am happy to
inform you I am well; or, Sirthe man I called on,
&c. What would one say, of a Frenchmana scholar,
and a critick, who should write,
On m'a dit vous etes
&c. instead of On m'a dit
que
vous etes. Yet, the
law is the same, in all languages; and, if we would feel
the ridicule properly, we should look to some language,
that has never been so corrapted, as our own.
vol. ii. F
You desire to learn something of the state of your
favourite
art, here. I do not pretend, as you know,
Stafford
,
to understand the language of connoisseurs in the
matter; but, what I know, in the most intelligible
language
that I am master of, is heartily at your service.
In the first place, you cannot be ignorant that Mr.
West; or, as you chose to call him,
Sir
Benjamin West,
your president, is an American. Observe, I am not
boasting of thisand, least of all, to you. But, I
mention
it, as a point, from which to start, in the
enumeration
of American painters. A genuine Englishman, if
you mention the fact, that Mr. West is an American born,
will come down upon you, as he says, withAh, but
he was
educated
in England, Ergo; he is an Englishman.
Just so, it was with Alexander Hamilton. We,
Americans
,
boasted of him, because he was nursed and bred
among us. But then, you cried out. Ah! but he was
born
in England! So, that if he be but
born
, though he
never
lived
with you; or, if he were born here, and has
been with you for a visit, though he never
dwelt
among
you, you have always the modesty to claim him for an
Englishman. Nay, have you not claimed all our
discoveries
;
all our great men, as fast as they became conspicuous;
and, when you could not discover, that they had been in
England, or ever visited England, did you not fly to
the ridiculous expedient of accounting for their greatness,
by the operation of British laws? Thus, I remember,
that one of your reviews, remarkable for its arrogant
tone, and corrupt, barbarous English, not long since,
declared that Washington was the growth of America,
when she was a part of the British empire; and, that
since her dismemberment, she had produced no men of
such stature! inferring, of course, that a republican
government
,
was unfavourable to moral greatness. Had
they ever heard of Greece, and Rome?
You often boast of your superiority. I have smiled, to
hear you---even
you
, Stafford, whom I have heard,
sometimes
forgetting the character of a well-bred Englishman,
and charging us with degeneracy. It is common to ask,
where are
our
Shakspeares---Miltons---Bacons---Lockes
---Newtons?
Men of England! Where is
your
exclusive property
in the reputation of these men? We have as free and
incontestable
a title to it, as you. They are not
your
contemporaries
.
They are not of this generation. Where
then, is
your
property in their fame?
They stood among
your fathers. They were countrymen of your ancestors
.
To this, we answer
They stood among our fathers,
too. They were the countrymen of our ancestors, too
. All
the great men of Britain, who lived before our
Declaration
of Independence, left, as a legacy to the whole
British
empire, their crowns and sceptres; the regalia of
immortality. Till then,
we
were a part of that empire;
and our title, like yours, hath come to us, in the course
of descent and distribution. It is a title of inheritance,
only.
But, to the fame of men that have lived in Britain
since
our revolution; to
that
, we abandon all claim; we ask, only
for our own. Array
your
strong men together. We
will array
ours
.---And see who overtops, or outnumbers
the other.
Yet, who shall be impartial? Not an American. No;
nor a Britain? No.---Let us appeal then, to some other
people.
Let us look among them that are able and willing to
be just. There is the National Institute of France.
How many Britons do you find there? Five. How
many Americans? Seven. Yet, you are twice as
numerous
a people. Is not this a fact that speaks loudly?
But, I forhear; I allow much for national prejudice---
much, for republican partialities; but, will these account
for such a difference, where these members are all
honorary
members; elected, too, the majority of them, under
a regal government; and some, in a time of actual war,
between France and America. Remember our
population
,
and encouragement. What are they, in
comparison
with yours?
You have heard of Copely. He was a strong, homely
painter; but some of his portraits have great merit.---
There is Stuart, too; he has been among you---and you
have seen his Washington. I have seen copies of it in
Bengal, done in China. You have seen many. All are
like each other; but none are likenesses of Washington.
There is too much sublimity in the face. Stuart's
Washington, I have heard my father say, who knew him
well, was less what Washington was, than what he
ought to have been. The painter has infused into it,
an amplitude and grandeur, that were never the
attributes
of Washington's
face
. It is true, that there was a
settled majesty;an oppressive and great steadiness in
the countenance of Washington, that awed and
confounded
men. His passions were tremendous, even in
their repose; and it was impossible to become familiar
with him, even at his own fire-side. The men that knew
him best, and had been much with him, at times, when
all mankind are brought into a kind of fellowship; in the
field of battle, and at the dinner table; in the senate
chamber
,
and at places of publick entertainment; always
went around him reverentially, and regarded him, afar
off, without approaching; as men might, a sleeping giant,
whom it were impossible to contemplate with composure.
Stuart says, and there is no fact more certain, that
he was a man of terrible passions; the sockets of his
eyes; the breadth of his nose and nostrils; the deep broad
expression of strength and solemnity upon his forehead,
were all a proof of this. So, Stuart painted him; and,
though a better likeness of him were shown to us, we
should reject it; for, the only idea that we now have of
George Washington, is associated with Stuart's
Washington
.
Yet, why should we complain? It matters not
how a picture is painted, so that the copies are
multiplied
and received (if they resemble
each other
,) as
likenesses
.
There is a Mr. Charles W. Peale, of
Philadelphia
,
who wrought at Washington's face, at the same time
with one or two of his own sons, and somebody else: all
occupied themselves with different views, and different
featuresand, out of this, has been compounded a
picture
,
no more like
Stuart's
Washington, I confess, than
I, like Hercules. And yet, I am well assured, that
it is a better likeness; and, indeed, the
only
faithful
likeness
of the man, in the world. Judge Washington,
himself
,
I am told, has said this.
How strange it is!Thus we get accustomed to a
certain
image, no matter how it is created, by what illusion,
or under what circumstances; and we adhere to it, like a
lover to his mistress. If George Washington should
appear
on earth, just as he sat to Stuart, I am sure that he
would be treated as an impostor, when compared with
Stuart's likeness of him, unless he produced his
credentials
.
At Mount Vernon, there is a picture of him, just
after
his marriage with Mrs. Custis
[4]
[4]
The greatest curiosity there, except the key of the Bastile,
presented
by La Fayette.
. I have studied it
with attention. It is that of an ordinary man. There
is not a single feature, or expression of greatness in it.
Yet it is said to have been a remarkable likeness. I
have often thought of the probable reception which
that
picture would meet with, if exhibited,
now
, as the
portrait
of Washington. It would be laughed at. I say
of what importance is it, whether Stuart's portrait of
him be a likeness or not, so that all the portraits of him,
are by Stuart, or copies of Stuart. It matters not, for
example, how a word may be pronounced, so that all
agree to pronounce it the same way. So too, say the
lawyers, it often matters not what the law
is
, so that there
is
a law. And how know we that the pictures of Napoleon,
which we have seen, are likeness of him? He never sat
but once; and then, only for a few minutes to Grard;
and, during the whole time, kept walking about the room,
with a cup of coffee in his hand. The artist lost his
temper
,
as well he might, and painted the sketch only from
memory. Yet, if they are alike, we are satisfied.---
Thus too, we get a strange notion of nature, from
certain standards. A man goes to the theatre for the
first time. He sees the first actor of the age. All his
conceptions of nature are outraged. The passions are
all caricatured; the sentiment exaggerated. Again, he
visits a theatrehe sees some other actor. He no
longer thinks of naturehe only thinks of the stage.
Instead of comparing this man's performance with the
conceptions of his own mind, he compares it now with
the acting that he had seen before. In time, he thus
acquires
a
theatrical nature
a nature totally unlike and
vol. ii. F 2
distinct from the naked and great nature of humanity.
To this standardthat of his favourite actor, he applies
all other acting. The test is insupportable. It is
ridiculous
.
It is that spirit, which makes men always
believe
that the
first
way, in which they have heard a story,
is the true one:that
their
way is right; and all the rest
of the worlds' wrong. Thus you have heard the same
song sung to a dozen different tunes, and as many
different
words; and the same story located
[5]
[5]
No such verb as
to locate.Ed
.
in a dozen
places, by as many people, each of whom verily believed
that it happened
where
, and
when
, and
how
, exactly as
he
had heard it. Thus, a man inexperienced in the art of
painting, is shown a landscape. He examines it. There
is not a spot of bright green in the whole picture. He
retreatshe recognizes some familiar prospect. Yet
it is not nature. But who is the master? Claude
Loraine
AhWell,
really it
is
very natural! and,
ever after, instead of comparing pictures of the green
earth, with the green earth itself, he compares them with
the green earth of Loraine. Merciful powers---whither
have I rambled. I began with the head of Washington
and I have followed I know not whom, round the
whole world.
I meant to give you a history of our paintingsand,
to-morrow, if I have leisure, I will attempt it; but at
present, as I am upon the character of
George
Washington
,
I will try to set you right on some of your
opinions
.
Your theory has always been, that our faults are
in proportion to our virtues. And you have regarded
him
as an exceptionan anamoly in nature. You were
mis-informed, Stafford. George Washington had his
faults; and they were terrible. Naydid he never
blunder
;
and grievously too, in his warfare?Look at the
escape of Long Island. It was a desperate and
unmilitary
affair. He exposed his whole army to destruction,
in case of defeat. But these are not the faults, of which
I speak. They are of a deeper naturethey are
constitutional
.
His temper was the whirlwind in its wrath.
Let me give you some examples. At Kipp's Bay,
immediately
after the battle on Brookline heights, on Long
Islandhe lost all command of himself. His men
behaved
like cowards; and Washington flung the reins
loose upon his horse's neck,and struck at his men with
his sword; and snapped his pistols at them;nay,
would infallibly have been taken prisoner, had not his
family officers seized his horse's head, by force, and
turned him back.
Againwhile the enemy were storming Fort
Washington
,
he, with his principal officers, embarked in an
open boat, from fort Lee, on the opposite shore of the North
river; and they were all in a fair way of being captured,
every man of them, when he came to his sensesand
returned
.
Numerous examples are given of his violence; but they
are mere personal affairs:yet his conduct at the battle
of Monmouthhis treatment of Hamiltonhis rashness
at Princetonall this, show that George Washington
had his infirmities, in the same measure as his virtues.
And thanks be to God, that he
had! Now
we have an
example
to encourage us. Were he perfect, we should be
repelled, intimidated and discouraged. You will be
astonished
,
Stafford, to hear that his character is not
understood
by his own countrymen; but it is not. They
have so long listened to hyperbolical eulogy,
intemperate
,
and unmeaning praise, that he has lost to their eyes,
the chief attributes of humanityand become a God.
For shameGods are manufactured by the feeble of
mind, who, having no discrimination, no power of
analysis
;
find it easier to take
all
their clay from one bank,
than to compound it judiciously, of many, when they
would exhibit the workmanship of their hands. Good
night. To-morrow, in the same rambling way, I shall
probably, undertake an account of our paintingsand
painters. If I do it not, to-morrow, I hardly know when
I shall be able to do itfor that will be a leisure and
anxious day to me; as I am waiting the crisis of a
tremendous
disorder.
Tuesday Morning, half past eight
.
I have just breakfasted; and the day is my own. Not
to be interrupted, I have darkened my windows, and
denied
myself to all the world, but
you
, Staffordfor,
with
you, I am happy.
Among our present artists, conspicuous for portrait
painting, are
Stuart; Peale, (Rembrandt,) Sully:
Jarvis
, and
Wood
, (remarkable for his small portraits
in water colour.) Their styles are all different, but well
characterised; and I will try to give you some notion of
each.
The manner of Mr.
Stuart
is careless, bold and
confident
.
He developes character like a magician. He
uses little or no material; is authority, in whatever he
does; disdains to palliate, or soothe; and nothing can
tempt him to paint a feeble face. The consequence is,
that his women are very bad; and that his likenesses of
men, are, in general, very striking, and very dignified.
He delights in broad and heavy transparent shadowing;
is never brilliant or showy; and there is no such thing
as romance, or enthusiasm, in his pictures: but great
soberness of mind, strength, and muscle.
That of Mr.
Peale
is peculiar. He seems never
weary
of labour. His pictures are perfectly finished; and,
when he has a good subject, you may always look for a
very strong, beautiful, well-told portrait. His drapery
is, generally, capital; but too laboured;his flesh,
faithful
;
and the expression, usually, very true. But, he is
too jealous and thoughtful of his reputation; and, in one
word, too honest a man to hazard much:and the
consequence
is, that his portraits never startle us. There
are no brilliant passages in them. They are rather
profound
than amazing. He never lets one go out of his
hand, but as a piece of
workmanship
, which will always
be worth the money that he has been paid for it. This
has its disadvantage; for, were he to dash off his
pictures
,
with the vigour that is natural to him, the
effect
would often be greater. Of any given number of
portraits
,
executed in this way, it is true, that there would
be more bad ones than there are now;but then, there
would be a few, a very few, better than he ever produces
now. A beautiful
picture
, may be finished, no matter
how well;but a great
portrait
, particularly of a man,
and a great man, is apt to lose its strength in finishing.
But then, this is to be considered; the first is always
valuable
,
as a manifestation of the artthe latter
valuable
only for a season, and with those who know the
likeness
.
Of late, however, I have seen some bolder
movements
in this artist;a stronger, heartier, and less
anxious expression of power. Mr. Peale is not
remarkable
for taste or spirit; but for composure, and beauty,
and dignity.
The next, of whom I am to give you some information,
is Mr.
Sully
. But, you are not to understand that
there is any design in the order, in which I have placed
their names. Each is superiour to all the others in some
particular, and inferiour in some other.
Mr. Sully, who, I am sorry to say, is an Englishman,
by birth, and seven years of education, infuses his own
character into all his portraits. He is one of the most
indefatigable men in the worldan enthusiast in his art.
He throws, like a poet, or a dramatist, or an actor,
somewhat of himself into all the workmanship of his
hands. His women, therefore, are full of fire, and
instinct
with spirit, where it is possible for him to find
any justification for it. Their eyes, are the eyes of
poetry
,
deep and melancholy, or patient and timid; but
always, whatever be their expression, looking as if
copied
at the critical moment of their extremest beauty.
Mr. Sully, too, is especially happy in his arrangement.
His pictures are never velvetty; no strange lights, or
shadows
but
beautiful, and tranquil; or romantick, and
spirited. His characteristicks are elegance and taste.
He is not so remarkable for strength, or fidelity, or
workmanship;but, in all of his drapery, there is a
surpassing
gracefulness, and a careless unstudied richness.
His hair is wonderfully fine. It is always shining and
luxuriant
.
I should prefer Mr. Sully, I think, to any other
artist that I have known, if I wanted the portrait of a
youthful passionate, enthusiast, male or female;but,
if I wanted the likeness of a sober-minded man or
woman
,
I would go to Mr. Peale;and to Stuart, for
whatever
was awful, and distinct, and
real
. But Stuart has
no poetryMr. Peale very littleand Mr. Sully, the
poetry only of romance, in his pictures. With the latter
all is picturesque, fanciful and wildwhen he can have
his own waywith
well-bred
people. With the second,
all is sedateness, tranquillity, and goodness;with the
former, there is, always, a bold, careless spirit, which,
you can see has wrought, knowing that, whatever it
produced
,
would be regarded as a prodigy.
But, by the way, your Sir
Thomas Lawrence
, whom
Mr. Sully greatly resemblesbut only in the free, fine,
bold manner of Sir Thomas, and not in his late
prettinesses
and fopperiesis the greatest coxcomb,
notwithstanding
his high talent, that I know, among painters.
I have seen a noble picture of his, uniting, in itself, all
three of the manners, that every painter has during his
practice. Some parts were hard and cold, like a cautious
workman, finished by a painful and incessant
comparison
,
at every touch, with the original after the
first
manner
of all painters, when they begin;other parts were
boldly dashed out, like the work of a man, who looks at
his object, and then goes into another roomor waits
till another daysets up the canvasscatches up the
paintand throws it about, bravely, and at arm's length
boldlyfearlessly;the
second
manner of such men
as Stuart and Lawrence:and other partsthe rest of
that same portrait, I have found
laboriously finished
with a camel's hair pencil
. What do you think of that,
for the
third
manner of such a man as Sir Thomas
Lawrence
?
Why is this? Poets fall into the same errour.
They lose their fire and boldness; and become timid,
cautious, and exact, as their blood grows old. Is it that
they are afraid to
lose
the reputation which they
got
, by
caring much less about it? Men get a name, by working
for breadnot for a
name
and they lose their name,
the moment that they think of nothing
but
a name. Keep
them poorcomparatively unknownand they are
fearless
,
desperate
having little to lose
. After a while, they
have every thing to lose
little to gain:
and they go back
to their earlier experiments, and renew them, in their
old age;
forgetful
, generally, of the
disadvantages
which
had attended them, and which had been the cause of their
abandoning them, in their youth. Do you know the
cause of his melancholy? I have heard a sad story about
itenough to make the heart of any man bleed,
inwardly
,
all his life longcareless of fame, and every thing
else. He loved one of two sistersboth superiour
women
.
He was about to marry one, when he met the
otherloved herstruggled, and struggledbut to no
purposeand then dealt, like a man, with the first. She
bore it proudly neither trembled nor bentbut died of
a broken heartextorting a promise,
first
, from her
sister
,
upon her death-bed, never to marry the wretched
man. The surviving sister kept her promise
and died
also
. Heaven! what a fate for genius! Even our Alston,
toohis wife
left him
, in a strange land, just when the
skies were opening about him.
Mr.
Jarvis
One of the greatest humourists of the
age; and, did I want the picture of a humouristanything
happy, droll, and impossible for any other man to hit
I would go to Jarvis. There is an air of jovial oddity,
or great strength, in all of his favourite pictures. He
works hard, and faithfully; but would not have it known.
Full of eccentricity and humour, he is the delight and
rallying point.the nucleus, about which, all that is
eccentrick
and humorous, within the sphere of his
attraction
,
delights to assemble. His manner is rich,
diversified
,
and daring;that is, when he has a subject that
will bear him outbut a tame face, becomes the tamest
thing in the world, under the pencilling of Jarvis. One
would think, that he was fashioned for taking portraits,
only of such men as he knew, heart and soul; and
loved
as heartily. He is one of the boldest, and most
original
painters of the age; and is remarkable for the
strong individuality of his favourite heads---bold,
natural
composition, manner, and attitude. Yet, as
pictures
,
there is too little merit in the work of Mr. Jarvis; and,
when the originals have passed away, and the memory
of them, too, the greater part of his portraits will never
be valued as
pictures
, and still less as
paintings
. If they
be preserved at all, it will be because they were painted
by Jarvis; and because they were, in other days,
genuine
portraitsnot because of their merit; for that merit
is mortal, and co-existent only with the originals. But
that merit, in his pictures, I confess, to of be the highest
order. Mr. Jarvis has painted some
pictures
, however;
and one, of himself, which will always be valuable; but
there are very few. He is lately
doing
miniatures,
altogether
in his own way, off hand, and full of effect.
Mr.
Wood
is the last of whom I shall now speak;
though there are some others, strongly entitled to your
noticeas Mr.
Neagel
, just coming out, very much in
the manner of Stuart, though undetermined(very fine
talent,)and Mr.
Morse
but of him, more anon. Mr.
Wood paints in water-colours. He was once, and
continues
,
perhaps, to this hour, to be celebrated for his
miniatures; but there was a time, when he painted
nothing
but miniatures. He was then associated with Mr.
Jarvis. But a change in affairs, led him to adopt a new
style of work, which he could afford at less price. It is
the last thing that an artist will, or ought, to consent to
a reduction of price. He prefers giving some other
manner, though it be more troublesome and laborious,
for a less price. That prevents the disagreeable
inference
always made from a falling pricethat the fashion
of the ware is falling off. His first attempts were
tolerable
barely
tolerable. He laboured diligently; but the
end of all his labour, was a hard, polished, flat, earthern
picture, strangely like the original, nevertheless. But
the spirit of the man waxed impatient. He struck into
a bolder pathand the result is, at this moment, that he
is
unrivalled
. His pictures are fuller of vivacity and
character, than any that I have ever seen, of the same
size
. Now and then, it is true, I have seen some
admirable
oil likenesses, on the same scale, that were, to the
full, as
perfect;
but they were not so full of spirit and ease.
Mr. Wood I would never trouble with the face of a
woman
,
particularly, if she were young and beautiful; or, if
there were deep feeling in her eyes, unless I wanted her
miniature
. But, if she were a Catherine or Elizabeth;
or, had any other high minded, domineering, and
distinctly-marked
countenance, I would trust him with it,
in preference to anybody that I know. So too, with
men. His Dandies and Delicates, are inexpressibly
insipid
but
his men,
are
men.
There, my dear Stafford. Adieu for the present. I am
actually weary of the subject; yet, do not flatter
yourself
,
that I have relinquished it. NoI have much to
tell you yet, of our historical department; for, I assure
you, that, though we
are
Americans, we are getting to
make quite a figure in it.
Yours, forever
,
ED. MOLTON.
REV. MR. ASHTON TO EDWARD MOLTON.
My young friend
,
I have disturbed your proud spirit, and deeply
wronged
you. I have acted in a manner unworthy of my age,
and of my situation, as a minister of peace; and I hasten
to atone for it, I hope, in season to allay your
impatience
,
and disarm your resentment. I received a letter
from you, about a month since. I knew the
hand-writing
;
and (I do not pretend to justify myself,) in a
moment
of indignation, I returned it to you, immediately,
unopened
.
I am sorry for it. I beg your pardon. Can
you forgive me?will you? Perhaps, you have not
received
it. Indeed, I fervently wish that you may not;
at least, not until you have read this. But, if it be
otherwise
,
let me beg of you to return it, to me.
Not a week after I had forwarded that letter, my heart
and my conscience arose and strove with me, but in vain,
to bring me to repentance. I am not vindictive in my
vol. ii. G
temper, Mr. Molton; but I am old; and old men, though
they have little reason for it, being so much nearer than
others to the refutation of their errours, are apt to be
obstinate
.
I was. I resisted the admonition of my heart. I
strove mightily against it; but all would not do. I
remembered
your deportment; your temper; and what right
had I to judge you, unheard? It is true, my young friend,
that, to all appearances, you have been guilty of a
tremendous
crime. As it now
appears
, you have torn away
a bride from the arms of her husbandfled with her; and,
when pursued, left him weltering in his blood, upon the
beach. I can imagine no excuse, no palliation for this;
particularly, as I learn that you had an intrigue with the
same woman, before her marriage; and yet, such is my
compunction for my own unworthy, intemperate, and
unchristian deportment toward you, that I have
suspended
my judgment, difficult as it was, to do so, until I can
hear from you. If you be guiltysay so, and let me
pronounce the sentence of the law, upon you. I may weep,
young man; I may tremble; for you so resemble the son
whom I have lost, that I should feel as if sitting in
judgment
upon my own childyet, I would not avoid the
appointment. I should lift up my voice, and denounce
you. YetO would that you were innocent;would that
you could come to me; and kneel down with me, before
our Father which is in heaven; and put your hands into
mineand sayI am innocent of this.Of the blood of
this man; of the honour of this woman, I am innocent.
I wait to hear from you.
Farewell
.
CHARLES ASHTON.
REPLY.
I have only time to tell you, my dear and excellent
friend, that
I am
innocent. But the vessel is ready to
sail; and I have neither time nor inclination to tell you
the particulars. At some future dayno, I ought not
to say thatfor I never violate my word. I was about
to tell you, that, at some future day, I should be able to
communicate with you, face to face, all that led to this
transaction. But, I cannot promise this, unless
something
should transpire to change my present views,
radically
and completely. The secret is now in mine own
bosomthere it may die with me. I have nothing
therefore
,
to offer you, but my simple word. With that, you
must be satisfied. Believe it, if you canI am
innocent
of the husband's blood; and of the wife's honour. I
spilt the one, and rifled the other.I do not deny itbut
I did it, innocently. Do not doubt me. I have no
interest
in deceiving you; and no power to undeceive you, if
you continue to wrong me. Perhaps
perhaps
, I may be
able, one day or other, to detail all the mournful and
mysterious
adventures of my life, to you, as I would to a
father
.
There is one event, and
one
only, that can lead to
this. If that happen, you will see me, when you least
expect
iteither in body or shadow. Dead or alive, if it
be permitted to me, you shall be satisfied of my
innocence
,
whenever that event arrives. If I be deadand
the power be upon me, I will stand at your elbow, where
I last stood, and speak, if the miraculous organ of speech
remain to me;and, if not, I will look into your soul,
my friend, with the aspect of unclouded, and regenerate
innocence.
This will be given you, by Mr.
George Stafford
.
If you do not know him already, I beg that
this
may be
a sufficient introduction to you. I shall enclose it to him,
in a long letter, which I finished but yesterday, to go by
this vessel. FarewellI do forgive youwith all my
heart and soul; and entreat you to burn or forget, which
ever may be easiest, my letter, whenever it comes to hand.
I could almost wish that the vessel had foundered!
Truly yours
,
EDWARD MOLTON.
HELEN MOLTON TO CLARA PETERS.
Yes, my dear Miss Peters, you are rightly informed.
I did say that, the ladies, or many of them, on your
Eastern
Shore of Maryland; and, in your beautiful city of
Baltimore
too, were guilty of beastly practices. You
cannot be ignorant of what I alluded to; for, when I met
you at Baltimore, you were in a fair way to follow their
example. Must I speak plainly? Do you forget what
they meant, by inviting you, frequently, to go into the
garden, or your room, and take a
rub
? Merciful heaven,
how often have I seen them, with all their heads together
in a bye place, before I knew what was meant by
taking
a rub;
and, when I found that it was a cant phrase, to
express
,
what my stomach turns at, while I writethe
division
of snuffto be taken by handfullsyou have no
idea how pained and humbled I felt. What! women!
young and beautiful, getting into a corner, to eat snuff.
The thing would be incredible, were it not known to be
very common. I know a remedy. Let their names be
published
.
The women that I speak of, are accustomed to
chewing
snuff
, in such quantities, and so continually, as to
intoxicate them, and shatter their constitution. Clara
Petershave you forgotten Mrs. C, and the two
Misses P? They consumed pounds and pounds of
snuff, till the hands of the former, shook like those of a
confirmed drunkard; and her head trembled, as if she
had the palsy; and the complexion of the two latter, the
younger of whom was once a blooming, sprightly girl,
became swarthy, sallow, and cadaverous. When I spoke
to them, and to you, my dear, for your folly in
attempting
the experiment, what was their apology? They only
used snuff they said, to
clean their teeth
.Faugh!what
a filthy practice. But that was not true. They
always
had a mouthful of it. They ate it, by spoonfuls; and
loved
it, as they say in Maryland, mighty
bad;
and I told
them nothing more than was truewhen I said, that it
was
beastly
that it was the worst and most
unpardonable
of all intemperance;that it was eaten only to
produce
inebriety, like opium, brandy, or tobacco, except
that, no tobacco-chewer,
beastly
as he may be, consumes
a quantity like them. YesIt was to that, that I
alluded
.
The practice
is
beastly.
HELEN.
SARAH TO JULIET.
Tell me, my dear,
dear
Juliet, what has become of you?
John says that you are really married;
married
to Mr.
Grenville. I cannot believe it; yet, strange as it is, my
poor heart begins to yield to the apprehension. Was it then,
your
hand writing, that disturbed me so? Was it you,
Juliet, you, whom I have so loved, that told me, with a
trembling hand, to believe nothing, that I did not hear
from yourself? I have obeyed you. I am told, that you
ran away. I do not believe it. I am told, that you have
been turned out of doors. I do not believe it. I am told,
that you are married to Mr. Grenville. I never will
believe
that
, until I have it in black and white, under your
own hand.
I have nothing more to say. I have few comforts left
for me. I can ill spare the smallest of them now;but
the bitterest, the most insupportable of bereavements to
me, Juliet, would be the loss of my love, and respect for
you.I cannot go onthe tears gush out of my eyes,
at every throb of my heart; and wert thou near me, my
own dear,
dear
Juliet, I should be sobbing, like a child, in
thy bosom.
Am I unkind, Juliet?Pity me, if I amit is not
natural
to me. There is no unkindness at my heart. I
never, never loved thee so tenderly; so, as if there were
nothing else on earth dear to me, as at this moment.
Then, why should I doubt thee? I do not,-I will not--I will
believe nothing, suspect nothing, until I hear it from
thine own sweet lips, (for
writing
may deceive me,) that
thou art no longer worthy of my veneration. No,
I will be more cheerfulI will.
vol. ii. G 2
Is it not wonderful, dear Juliet?yes, I
will
change
the theme. I
will
forget that I have been weeping for
theeit is the only way.
Is it not strange, Juliet, that I have heard nothing, of
late, from the deaf-and-dumb man?Nay, what a
ridiculous
question!but, I am sadly anxious to write about
something, with an air of pleasantry. I often think of
him; and, in my dreariness, I have almost wished that
he might stand before me.
Laugh with me, Juliet!Nay, laugh
at
me, for I
really
deserve it. Do you know, that, just at that moment,
where I left off, I happened to lift my eyesand, if ever
I
was
possessed, it was at that instant, I declare I
never
was so frightened in my lifeI saw the very eyes of
the deaf-and-dumb man rivetted upon me!
as I thought
.
A cry escaped me, I believe; but, the good creature
appeared
more terrified than I; and, though I confess, that his
first attempts at conversation were laughable enough,
yet, in a few moments, he was quite intelligible. I came
to my senses, and who do you think it was?nobody,
in the world, but my poor drawing-master.
Pray, said I, Mr. Randolph, (with some
embarrassment
,
I confess; for I had been inconceivably terrified,
and I was anxious to learn if he had heard me say any
thing aloud; for sometimes, you know, I have been guilty
of talkingnot to
myself
, exactly, but loud enough for the
neighbours to hear me, when I was all alone;) how long
have you been here? He smiled.
Only a moment, I assure you.
A pause
I see that you are distressed. Let me re-assure you.
I knocked at the outer door; but, as it stood ajar; and
nobody
came to me; and I saw you occupied, as I thought,
with your painting, I ventured to come into the room.
It was not, till I had bowed twice or thrice; and was on
the point of announcing myself with some emphasis, that
you designed to lift up your eyes. And when you did,
what a reception! I know not whether
you
were
frightened or not; but I am pretty sure that I was. My
hair will never lie close again, while I live. Nay, it is
cruel in you to laugh; does'nt this chattering of my teeth
convince you, that, whatever it may have been to you, it
was no laughing matter with me.
His countenance changedhis hand fell upon my
shoulder.I was indignant. I had half a mind to strike
it offbut, before he had finished a sentence, I had
entirely
forgotten that it was there; and, it was not till he had
left my room, that I remembered it, as a freedom that I
will never permit again. Yet, he, I am sure, was
unconscious
of it. It was done with the most natural, frank,
plausible manner in the worldas if in excess of
earnestness
;
just as if he had forgotten himself, in his anxiety
to re-assure me.
Miss Ramsay, said he I am come on a serious
errand
.
Yet, before I trouble you with it, allow me to
assure you, that you uttered not a loud word; that, I
overheard
nothing.
I started.Could the creature read my thought?
or had he read my letter?.Read my letter!ridiculous
indeed;
that
part of it, was not then written. He
continued
.And
that I saw nothing, heard nothing, which you
have any reason to lament. I see, by your countenance,
that you are apprehensive of this. Believe me, I tell
you nothing but the truth; and, had I, by any
misfortune
,
overheard anything, or overlooked anything, that
was not meant for my ears or eyes, I should have been
as much distressed at it, as yourself.
It was said in a manner,
so
convincing, that I could
not doubt it. I forgave him, therefore; and then, I
forgave
myself.
But, what think you, was his errand? Let me tell
you, in his own words.
You have sent for me, to teach you drawing. I have
obeyed the summons. You would learn painting. I am
unable to teach
you
that. You appear surprised. It is
natural. I pass for a drawing-master. I have even
taken likenesses. Nay, I have taught others, who were
superior to you; yet. I cannot teach you. This would seem
to be a paradox. But, the truth isI am an impostor.
My blood thrilled, Juliet;and I declare to you, that
I began to fancy that there were the same eyesagain,
that I had seen so near my face, in Boston;when I was
taken up, as I thought, by the deaf-and-dumb man, from
under the very wheels of the carriage, and hoofs of the
horses---what a delightful adventure it would have been!
---what a novel might have been made of it! But ah---
the incorrigible reality. It would come---and dash!
away went the cup of mystery and enchantment. He
continued,I am an impostor. I have been teaching an
art, of which I am ignorant. But then, I am not so
ignorant
as the people here. When I began, I knew nothing
of it. I never had any instruction; but I have taught
myself, by blundering, and by teaching others. My
manner has been assured, composed- and I have a
consummate
impudence. The game, that I have played, has
been a fair one; but it cannot continue. I have found
one woman, whom I can respect. For that reason, I tell
you the truth. I foresee the consequence. You will
dismiss
me---and my ruin will follow, for,
here
, I have no other
means of livelihood. Yet---I cannot consent to impose
upon
you:
why, I know not, for I
could
do it, if I
would;
and I have imposed upon wiser and more experienced
people than Miss Ramsay.
I was amazed; and yet, the frankness of the creature
pleased me. No, Mr. Randolph, I will retain you yet;
and do what I can, to promote your school; I know
nothing
of your landscapes, or colouring, or likenesses; but I
am pleased with your drawing, and can improve by it.
You are mistaken, said he: your style is better than
mine. You smile---I am gratified that you take the
disclosure
so pleasantly. Let us continue our acquaintance.
I shall be here for a few weeks longer; and will, if you
will permit me, continue to visit you, at the same hour
---as your drawing master; but, on this condition alone,
that I receive no pay. You look alarmed---I mean, no
pay in money;---but, I am willing to be paid, by your
instruction
for mine. I love your colouring. It is bold
and beautiful. I have a faculty of imitation, and can
profitby it, I am sure.
I consented. But pray, said I, for I could not help
laughing at the oddity of the conceit---how have you
managed to get the reputation that you have, as a
drawing
master?
He smiled---and went to confession, forthwith; and
his frankness became so irresistibly droll and unxpected,
that, though I am not much addicted to laughing aloud,
and was never less in a laughing humour, yet it made
me laugh so often, and so loudly, that I have had a pain in
my side ever since; and he has been gone a full hour.---
and the best of it was, that the man looked all the while,
as if he had no concern at all in the matter.
If you will have the patience to hear me for a few
minutes, said he, I will let you into the whole
mystery
.
But first, let me remark, so that you may not be
offended at my bluntnessthat I treat women, no
matter
who they are, just as I do men; or, with very little
more forbearance or consideration, when I respect them.
I treat them as companions, friends, people of
understanding
,
or fools; and contradict them, correct them, or
laugh at them, whenever they deserve itnot
merely
to make them ridiculous, or to hurt their feelings;
but, wherever it may be a benefit to them. I will not
offend you, if I can help itbut I would have you
prepared
for a manner that is new to you among men. Most
men treat women like spoilt children, who must not be
contradicted, or opposed, or thwartedwhose bad
temper
must always be humouredI do not. I respect
women
,
but it is in my own way. I would make them wiser
and better; and, therefore, I say that
to
them, and before
their face, which I never say, or permit another to say
behind their backs. Profligatesmen that think most
irreverently of women,
cannot
do this---
do
not. So, you
see---I am no profligate. Now, to my story. When I
was a boy, I was fond of pictures. I began to imitate
them; and, as all children do, I became passionately
enamoured
of vivid colouring. I had no models; or, what
was worse than none, very bad ones; but, such as I had,
I imitated, and surpassed. In that way, by stealing a
hint, here and there, from water-coloured daubing;
samplers
and embroidery; fruit and birds, &c.I soon
managed
to make, what I thought, extremely pretty
roses
and
rose
buds
. At this time, all that I had learnt, was, to
imitate some wretched stuff, in the drawing-book of a
girl, that went to the same school with my sister. But
my
roses
soon grew in repute; and I had my hands full of
solicitation
from all my uncles and aunts, and cousins---
yet, devil of a rose would I part with---I beg your
pardon
for swearing. One of my expedients, to give effect
to these flowers, was, to varnish them with gum-arabick,
till they would crack and peal off, like the glazing of
crockery, in cold weather; or like the Japan tinning
of bad ware, by a hot fire.
I had a school master, who was a prodigy of genius in
our
estimation--and his own. He had painted many surprising
matters; but nothing that tickled my fancy like a young
chicken cock, upon a gray rock, in full feather,---with a
gray squirrel upon a gray tree. And one day, for some
freak of mine, he was unlucky enough to think of locking
me up, alone, in the school room.---I attacked his treasury,
directly---pillaged it; ransacked the desk; and bore
off the cock and squirrel in triumph. As soon as I had
arrived at
my room
, I sat down to copy it. And so
surpassingly
ignorant was I then, of the manner, in which the
gray, stone colour was produced, that, instead of looking
for Indian ink, the properties of which, I knew nothing
of, I compounded a strange wash of the black and white,
which were in my sister's paint box. Yet, with these, I
persevered, until I had made so perfect a copy, that, I am
sure, my master, himself, could hardly have told which
was his own. That was the height of my ambition.
Some time after, I was put apprentice to a
retail-shopkeeper
;
but my passion, for drawing and painting, still
remained
;
and I grew fond of copying whatever came in
my way. The consequence was, that I learnt all the
faults
of each. Yet, I learnt to draw. At length, I
undertook facesprofiles, simply, because an old man
that boarded with me, used to amuse himself, while he
was starving, in the same way. It is easy to make a
profile, an outline I mean; but the difficulty is in filling it
upso that some one, among a multitude, may
guess
at the
original. This done, for once; and people are very
quick at such discoveries, where there is'nt anything to
payand confoundedly backward, as I have found, to
my mortification, where there
is
the reputation of the
artist is established forever.
Wellit happened, in the course of time, that I learnt
to draw with some precision and vigour; but my
principles
were wrong; and I was unable to fill up the outline,
from a total ignorance of light and shadow.
ButI happened, also, to discover that Indian ink was
not to be put upon the paper, black as ten thousand devils
---your pardon, Miss---I must break myself of this vile
habitand then washed light. This had been my
practice
.
And, Columbus, when the sailor upon the top, cried
out land!and Archimides, when he sang out
Eureka!
Eureka!
did not feel more astonishment and delight than
I, when I learnt that Indian ink was to be put upon the
paper, diluted
lightly
at first; and to be deepened
afterward
by repetition. It was an era in my life.
About this timeyou will not forget, that I was a
clerk to the mystery of selling tape by the yarda man
came to my native town to teach writing,
in twelve
lessons
.
He was a precious scoundrelan ignorant and
presumptuous fellow, without education or principle;
but he did write a wonderfully beautiful hand, and made
some pretensions to drawingnay, almost overpowered
us, I remember, once, with the picture of two red
cheeked
angels, in a whirlwind of fire and smoke, with blue
wings, and a great gold pen in their jaws.
With this man, I enlisted
to see the world;
having the
most magnificent designs and adventures in view. The
first thing, that he did, was to pack me off to Brunswick
College, where I found a parcel of fools, from six years
old and upward, to pay me for teaching them to write
in twelve lessons, of two hours each
. Perhaps you
would like to understand the mystery of that. It lay
simply herein the course of these twelve lessons, a
person
was made to write more
lines
and
pages
, than he
usually
did in a whole year; and this too, under the eye of
the master, with the best of pens, the best of ink, and
his paper so ruled, that, for his life, he could not go
wrong.
Well, I continued my career, till I found it necessary
to claim a part of my salary; for, I had managed so as to
consume all the receipts; cheating, too, with all possible
adroitness; and economizing, till it approached to
meanness
.
My next movement was for New York. But I
stopped
at Portsmouth, where the people would not bite
though one would have thought that they might, in the
mere spirit of retaliation; they having been
bitten
confoundedly
,
to my certain knowledge, more than once,
in one way, and another, the same generation. Well
in Portsmouth, I, finally, had wisdom enough to abandon
the itinerant, and
low
life of a writing master, to become
ashopkeeperagain. I took up with the partner
of a man, with whom I had lived, when first tempted
away from the counter. He was a petulant, haughty,
ignorant, money-making man; but, with a good head
and a warm heart, I think at the bottom;and, with him
I continued, until I had spoilt the hand writing of his
two daughters
gratis
, in teaching them my
twelve-lesson
schemeI then quarrelled with him--and parted,
with just cash enough in my pocket to carry me home,
and buy a halter.
What was I to do?I had a serious aversion to
hanging
a
constitutional one perhaps; partly, I dare say, in
the mere spirit of contradiction; for most of my friends
seemed to regard
that
, as the infallible termination of
my adventures. So, rather than hang or starve, I took
to drawing; and, finally, after offering to teach to the
people of my native place, who never would be fools
enough to pay me for it, the art of penmanship; and,
deposited
some egregious specimens of my folly in the hands
of some, whose interest it was, to get me some scholars,
but whose sense of common decency, proably prevented
them from exhibiting my specimens;I borrowed a few
dollars of a relation, and started, to seek my fortune, in
this part of the world. I determined never to return, till
I was able to buy a dose of arsenick, at least, with my own
money, honestly earned. I arrived in an open boat, at
Bathwhere I dined at a tavern, and ran away,
without
paying for my dinnerfor old acquaintance sake
for the landlord knew me; and, truly, he deserved
nothing
better, for admitting me into his house, without
the money in advance.
From Bath, I went to Hallowell, and opened a
writing
school. But---I thought of drawing, and added that
to it. The thing took tolerably; and I then came up the
river. But let me tell you how I have managed to get
the reputation that I have. If anybody know more of the
art than I do, I am sure to pump all his knowledge out of
him, and apply it to my own; amusing him all the
while, as jugglers do,
their
prey, by talking about Titian,
Reubens, Raphael, colouring, conception---
Chiaro
oscuro
,
&c. &c. as fast as I canand
that
, you know, must
be tolerably fast. This will, generally, take his breath
away; and, people are always kind enough to conclude,
that, whatever is inexplicable, in my style or language,
is something superiour to their understanding. On some
occasions, I confess, that I have been hard run; and that,
I have not always been able to keep my countenance.
You know how
sore
people are, when they cannot
guess
for whom a picture has been taken; and how delighted
they are, when they happen to guess right. I took
advantage
of this.I always painted profiles; and, if there
were a big nose, or a wen, or a wart, or a long chin,
that
was enough for meif not, I was fain to content myself
with a cocked hat, or a pair of spectaclesthe likeness
of which, I could not miss; and all the world could
see
, at a
glance. I contented myself then, with the
outline
, only;
and
that
, I took care, to show to somebody that knew
who had been sitting. This would always resemble the
person, if he were devilish uglyyour pardon, Miss
and, having once got an opinion of this kind, the money
was my own. I knew that no blundering of mine, could
ever destroy a likeness, once acknowledged; and, there
fore, I went on, working as fearlessly with my indian
ink, as if I were blacking a pair of boots: and the
expression
was, generally worthy of the work. Nay, I have
vol. ii. H
laughed, time and again, till the tears came into my
eyes, on looking at my own pictures, as they darkened and
darkened, like negroes, drying before a slow fire, after
the reiterated washes that I had given them.
And onceI must tell you thisthere was a captain
of the United States' army, at Hallo wella
prodigiously
ugly manwith a nose like a coffee-potno, bigger
than thatlike a pump-handle. I made a likeness of
that featurefor, it was impossible to miss itand I
had half a mind, when I had finished the nose, to stop
for I knew that all the world would acknowledge it; but,
at last, on second thought, I concluded to put a chin,
and some other things, of the same sort, to itfor he
might be unreasonable, you knowand I liked to give
every one his money's worth;and so, I put some other
features to it, at my leisuregiving myself no trouble
about their being
his
the nose was enough for mefor
I had constantly dreamt of it; nay, it had haunted me in the
day-time, from the hour that I began its likenesslike
the spectre of something that had been unfairly dealt
with. Well, I finished the likenessand such a
likeness
!by
Jupiter, there was'nt a dog in the house, that
would'nt have yelled out, at the sight of it. He came to
get it. I could hardly keep my mouth shut, though I
bit my lip, till the blood came. He grew black in the
face, while he looked at itand the likeness grew, every
moment, more striking. Had his rage continued till
this time, the resemblance would have been perfect. He
consideredknit his browsand, I am sure, that
that
balancing
in his mind, was, whether he should break my
head, or burn his own;and that he paid me for it, lest
I should show itwhich would have made him the
laughing stock of the whole town;and, I am equally
sure, that he put it behind the back-log, while I was
putting his money into my pocket.
On another occasion, a beautiful womanrather of a
doubtful character, though, I am toldcame to sit to
me, in one of the coldest days of winterthe depth of
January. I kept her, with her teeth chattering, till she
was the colour of raw meat, that had been frozen and
thawed, several times--in a thin muslin dress, for a whole
dayand then packed her off, some dollars lighter, with
a pretty picture, to be sure; or, rather, with the picture
of a pretty woman, with a smutty, dismal facebut no
more like her, than it was like my own mother. But I
had seen something of women beforeand I caught,
instinctively
,
what I have since learnt, is the perfection of
the trade. She wore a breast-pin; a collar of lace, richly
embroidered; and an open-worked muslin frock. All
these, I copied faithfully, with all their flourishes,
flings, and furbelows. The effect was surprisingevery
body knew the likeness of the breast-pin and ruffleand
every body concluded, that, although he was unable to
see the least likeness, I won't say of the woman herself,
for to that I did not even
pretend
, but of humanityyet,
that the fault was in
him
, and not in
me
for had'nt I
proved, that I could paint the likeness of a breast-pin
and ruffle?and why, then, could I not paint the
likeness
of a woman?her face?and features?
There, my dear Juliet, I have written you a letter;
the length of which, though it may weary you, I hope
you will receive, as an atonement for the unkindness of its
commencement. What think you of the man, Randolph?
Is there not something truly original about him? You
hear what he has said; but you ought to have
seen
him,
heard
him, while he described the captain. You would
never have forgotten itthere was such an air of
downright
pleasant seriousness, energy and simplicity that
but no matterfarewell.
S. R.
JULIET TO SARAH.
Congratulate me, Sarah, my sistercongratulate me;
I have just risen from my knees; and my senses are yet
reeling with the shock of a discovery, that had well nigh
been fatal to me. Such a scheme of darkness! continued,
too, for such a length of time; O, it is incredible that I
never should have dreamt of it; never suspected it! But,
let me tell you, as well as I can, of the whole affair, in
order, as it happened.
We were at breakfast, this morning. The servant
brought me two letters; one from you, (which I shall
answer
,
at the first leisure,) and one from Mr. John Omar.
I opened
his
first, because I desired to read yours, when
I was aloneI could'nt bear to read it, before the eyes,
even of my husbandit is like meeting some one that is
very dear to usafter a long, long time, in the presence
of a stranger. His letter was very brief; it merely
informed
me that Molton had sent for him, in a great
hurry
,
to see poor Jane, who was alarmingly ill. I was
just breaking the seal of yours, desirous of getting a peep
at it, before the table was cleared, when I heard a strange
noiseand, on looking up, I beheld my husband, as pale
as deathwith several letters, lying before him
their seals broken, and one in his hand, open. Before
I could articulate a cry, or arise from my chair, the
paper
dropped from his hand; and he sunk down,
gradually
upon the floor, on his knees; and bowed down his head,
like one, upon whom the hand of God was laid heavily.
His face was coveredbut I saw his chest heavehis
hair movehis forehead shiverhis lips tremble;
and the tears trickle through his fingers.
Almighty
God!
he murmured, at last,
I thank thee!
I was inconceivably frightenedI know not what I
did, or what happenedbut, when I awoke, my head was
in his lap, and he was looking over me, with a look of
such impassioned, such distracted tenderness, that,
for
the first time
, Sarah, my heart gushed out, with
unadulterated
affection. From that moment, I was the
happiest
woman in the world;but, judge of my consternation,
my horrour and dismay, when he put the following
letter
,
from Molton, into my hand.
Enclosed are the proofs, that I went in search of.
They are wet with blood;but do not fear to read them.
It is the blood of the guilty. Your heart is now satisfied;
and the restraint which you imposed upon yourself, for
a time, you now see, was salutary and wise. It was well
for you, that you never told the tale to your wife. If
you had, it would have killed her. No matter when the
proofs of her innocence had come to you, if there were
one moment, between the arraignment and the acquittal,
she would have died, of a broken heart. Jane is at the
point of death. I have dealt plainly with her; cruelly,
perhaps; but there was no other way, and I feel no
compunction
,
for my own conduct. The papers, that you
will find in this, are the copies, and proofs of the whole
conspiracy. You would do well, I think, to put the
whole into the hands of your wife. She is capable of
appreciating such confidence; and she will love you, if I
know anything of her character, better than she ever
has yet, when she knows the whole.
And what do you think was the nature of this
conspiracy
,
Sarah? It was such, thattears, hot tears and
confusion, would not permit me to communicate to any
human being but yourself; nor even to you, perhaps, if
I did not so earnestly desire that you should know what
a noble heart I have for a companion.
The letters were a pretended correspondence, between
Molton and myself, of a nature, so artfully managed, by
mingling fact with falsehood, that they went through my
heart, sometimes; and I trembled like a guilty woman,
to see how capable my conduct has been, of the cruelest
interpretation. It was a long time, before I could
understand
them, at all.I read them over again. Still,
they were unintelligible. I saw that they were managed
to prove an intriguea shameful, dishonourable,
criminal
intriguebetween Molton and myself. But whom
were they to deceive?Not my husband, for
they
had
promoted his views, with all their power. But the
mystery
was soon explained. The hand writing, I saw, was
Jane'sbut there were interlineations, and alterations,
in a different handI hope that I am not accusing the
innocent, but they
did
look to me, like the work of Miss
Matilda.
My husband then produced a packet of letters; and
put them into my hands. I opened them. The first
was directed to me, and was in the hand writing of
Molton
.
I began to read; but, bewildered and frightened, I
looked to Mr. Grenville, for explanation. He shook
his head, and smiled; but the tears stood in his eyes yet.
vol. ii. H 2
He handed me anothermy hand shook with terrour;
the writing was so like mine, that, it was some minutes,
before I could assure myself that it was notnor did I,
to my own satisfaction, till I had read the letter. It was
full of passionate, wild entreaty; andbut I cannot tell
you what the meaning of it wasit made me tremble
and weep, with indignation. My husband took my
hand. It was well managed, said heJulietsee
here. He then showed me the regular post mark, and
my own seal, upon two of the letters. The truth now
flashed upon me, all at once; I remembered that Jane
and I were taught by the same writing master; and that,
although she wrote a better hand than I; yet, that, at
school, she was able to write exactly like me; for, on one
occasion, I narrowly escaped punishment, for some of her
scribbling. I remember too, that, having borrowed my
seal once, she pretended that she had broken, and lost the
cornelian; for, she returned me the setting, only.
But when, and where did you receive these vile
things? said Iand how could Mr. Molton be base
enough?
Hush, Julietwe must not speak rashly of that man.
You, surely, do not believe
that
(handing me one of the
letters) to be his hand writing?as well might I believe
this
to be yours. Nothe same hand that counterfeited
the one, counterfeited the other.
I was glad to hear this, I confess; for even now, I
cannot
bear to think meanly of Edward  Molton, I
should sayMr. Molton. But when did you receive
them? how? and from whom? said I.
He grasped both my hands in his; and, while he spoke,
the voice appeared to issue from the deepest place of his
heart. Never was I more affected in my life.
I received them, said he, from a person unknown,
the very next morning after our marriage.
Gracious heaven! said I, and this that was the cause
of the change in your deportment, which so nearly
deprived
me of my senses?
It wasI endeavoured to conduct as usual. I
endeavoured
to disbelieve the damnable slanderNay, many
times,
many times
, my beloved, was I upon the point of
burning them, at once;but then, a wish to discover the
truth, prevented me. More than once too, I was on the point
of calling you to me, and putting them into your hands.
But thenif by any possibility, they were genuine, what
madness that would be.It would destroy you and your
husband, dear Julietit.
At length, I resolved to be silent; and it was only then,
when my troubled spirit had become calm and
submissive
,
that I observed how deeply you had been distressed.
New doubts arosethey might have been a confirmation
to one of a jealous naturebut I am not jealous; at least,
not suspicious; jealous I am, of sharing thy heart, my
wife, I confess, with any being but my MakerNay, I
can hardly endure the thought of that, at times.In
short, Juliet, I determined to keep the whole a secret from
you, until I had given you
proof
, by my manners and
confidence, that I did not believe the slander.
I pressed his hand, SarahI could have knelt to him.
What magnanimity! what generosity! My husband!
said Itill this hour, I have never known you? But
(a thought struck me just then) there is one thing upon
which I have been silent so long, that, now, I dare not
mention it. It was a trifle at first; and had I spoken of
it, exactly as my heart prompted me to speak of it, all
would have been over;but by thinking of it, so long,
and putting it off, so frequently, it has become .
What! Juliettell me at onceI tremble more at
such an introduction, than at
any
disclosure. What do
you allude to?
To
that
letter, said I, reaching him one, that I had
carried, ever since our marriage, in my pocket book,
determined
,
when I had the heart to speak lightly of it, to
ask an explanation.I now ask what you had ever seen
in my conduct to authorize you to .Nay I do not
mean to be very serious now; but
then
I was hurt and
mortified.
I stopped suddenly, for, with an air of perplexity that,
on any other occasion would have been irresistibly
ludicrous
he
began rummaging his pocket-book, and
produced
a lock of hair.Is that
yours
? said he.
I took itlooked at itand was fain to say, upon my
word, I believe that it is.But where on earth did you
meet with it? And why did you once hint, so strongly
as you didthat something of the sort would be very
dear to you, if you had this already. Is it mine?
Is that your writing? said he, reaching me the
envelope
.
I examined itit
was
my writing; I could not
deny it.--But, judge of my confusion, when I read itit
was in these words:
YesI will indulge you, if it be true that there
would be any value in it, to your eyes; but, on this
conditional
one, a whimsical one, I confess, but, nevertheless,
a condition, with which I cannot dispensethat you
never
allude to it, in any way hereafter. My troubles and
mortifications are already too numerous for my patience;
and I cannot submit to their augmentation. Adieu.
Heaven forever bless you.
Are you not terrified, Sarah?That note was really
written by me; but, how or when, I have not the least
recollection, but I probably wrote it some time, at the
solicitation of Jane, for I was in the common practice
of doing so; and now, that I look at the initials,
they
appear
to have been written by anotherthe I, in
particular
,
is more like the I, that Jane writes
her
name with,
than mine. YesI have no doubt of itthe occasion
is forgotten; but that note, I am sure, was written by me,
under her direction, while her hand was lame, from her
falland that note, the cruel girl had the wickedness to
send to Grenville, inclosing a lock of my hair, after I
told her, that I had refused to understand him.
Nor is this all. On coming to an entire explanation,
it appears that several notes and keep-sakes in the
possession
of both of us, were furnished by Jane. What
inconceivable management! I was mortified to the heart.
But my excellent husband soon re-assured me; All these
matters, my dear wife, said he, must be forgotten; or
remembered only as a piece of pleasantry. Hereafter, let
our aim be to make each other happywe will never
remember
how
we happenened to be marriedby whose
agency, or by what meansbut that we
are
married.
Congratulate me, Sarah;is it not a miraculous
escape
?
And would not an ordinary man have been
disturbed
,
immeasurably, by such treachery. And could I
ever have held up my head afterward; innocent or
guilty
,
if my husband; the lord of my affections; the partner
of my heart, had
once
suspected me!O nevernever.
Farewell
,
JULIET.
P. S. I quite forgot the drawing master.I have
read your letter, and laughed heartily enough, I assure
youbut there is one thing, that I would caution you
againsthis cold-blooded impudence.That manner of
putting his hand upon yours--or, upon your shoulder,
is treacherous. It is never done by accident;or, if it be,
it is no compliment, to a woman. It is better that it
were done with design; for that implies a respect for her,
and a consciousness that, to be at all familiar, one must
approach
cautiously. I do not like it for another reason
it reminds me somewhat, of a person whom I once knew.
If
his
hand once touched you, you were
gone!
irretrievably
gone. You would have neither the strength nor
the courage; nor often the inclination to displace it.
--Beware
of this man--awkward as he is--he must be
dangerous
,
to have enthralled Sarah Ramsay, for a single
moment
,
so that she suffered
his
hand to repose upon her
shoulder.
J. R. G.
JOHN TO SARAH.
She is gone, Sarah, gone, forever and ever! gone, in
terrour and distraction, to a grave of blood. Never was
there such a death-bed scene!---I will not attempt to
desscribe
the whole; I cannot, but I will trywith the feeble
remains of my strength, to relate what happened after
my arrival.
The first person that I saw, was Molton---sitting by
her bed side; immoveable; and, with a countenance of one
death-struck, holding one hand upon her temples, and
supporting his own forehead with the other.
She had just life enough to move her lips, and to
perceive
whose hand it was that allayed, with its chilliness,
the scorching fever of her temples. Her vivid eyes were
lifted now and then, to his, with an expression of
tenderness
,
passionate tenderness, so unlike aught that I had
ever seen in them before, that I could scarcely believe her
to be Jane. It was a comfort to her, to have him near
her---
that
, I could see distinctly---though his face was
the face of a Destroyer; of one, that nothing, no weeping,
nor prayer, nor terrour, nor trial, may move,
---unrelenting
,
stedfast and inexorable.
I listened; but I could not hear him breathe. I
approached
;
and, as he turned to me, he moved his hand---
and she caught it, as it passed her lips--and pressed it to
them, again and again---with a low, sobbing, inarticulate
sound of transport---O, do not leave me, Molton; do
not take it away! But he gave me his hand, hot and
moist, from the pressure of her mouth, nevertheless. It
was like the touch of a serpent to me. I shuddered.---
Jane saw it, and a sickly smile went over her features;
and then they grew, all at once, rigid, fixed,
---motionless
.
She is gone!
---said Molton---in a low whisper;
and, as he spoke, her hand dropped from his---and her
jaw fell. Ah, how suddenly!---it was just as if her spirit had
sprung, without notice, from her tenement, dislocating
and shattering every joint, in her wrath and determination;
as something obscene and horrible, and hateful to it.
I was about to be left alone, immediately, with
Molton
,
and the body; but he arose, and put himself between
one of the women, and the hall, just as she was shutting
the door. Come back, madam! said he. Nay, do
not resist me,I
will
be obeyed. She shook in every
joint; and, when he led her to the bed, the sweat started
out upon her quivering lips; and her eyes looked as if she
were about to be immolated on the spot. It was
Matilda
.
The lights burnt with a pale, funereal, uncertain light.
Woman! said heturning down the clothes and
revealing
the body of Janewoman! that is
your
work.
I lookedand beheld the sheets sprinkled with drops
of blood.
There was a deep ruffle about the neck of Jane, which,
from its singularity, I had before observed. He was
about removing it, when Matilda arrested his hand with
a loud shriek.
Man! monster! monster, forbear!she cried. And
pushed away his handbut, not till I had seenO,
Sarah
!
Sarah!I cannot tell thee what. No, noI
cannot
,
my blood thrills yet, at the thought of it.
Jane had destroyed herself.
I know not why, nor wherefore. I only know that, when
I spoke of it to Molton, he shuddered, locked his hands
and his eyes rolled inward, as if to contemplate
something
that no other man would dare to look upon. Yet
he recovered, almost immediately.
I did not expect this, said he. Butthere was a
duty to perform, to the innocent and devout. I did it.
That woman, whose body lies there, is now before her
Maker, in judgment. Let us not speak unkindly of her.
She had a noble spirit; and, under any other training
than thineturning to Matilda, who was leaving the
roomthou bad womannay, thou shalt not leave me
thou and I will sit by the body together, till the turf be
piled upon itbut for thee, it had been instinct with
spirit
;
beautiful; and innocent as beautiful, at this moment!
Tears!nay, then,gogo in peace. If thy heart be
touched indeed, I have no more to do with thee. My
commission has expired. Go in peace!
I am glad that you have come, Mr. Omar, late as it is.
But, for your sake, it would have been better that you
had arrived a few hours earlier. You are a man of
strong passions. To have seen that body, sir, convulsed
and heaving, with bloodshot eyes, and locked hands;
every limb cramped with agony; and her lips trembling
with blasphemyto have seen her, as I saw her, all
night long, delirious and redGod!it would have
shaken the stoutest heart, that was ever inhabited with
life. What did this, sir? What hath left that beautiful
tenement a wreck?that shrine, a ruin?that woman
of powera mass of dust and ashesblood and
corruption
?
What did it, sir? Look at me.
It was her
passions
!
I stood before her. I charged her with a conspiracy
against the honour and peace of the newly married; the
newly blessed;---with having driven two human beings
into wedlock, for no other purpose than to break their
hearts, and unsettle their minds, with jealousy and
despair
.
She denied it. I charged her, in the name of the
living Godin the presence of Jahovah and his angels.
Still she denied it---but, while the words were upon her
lip, she staggered and fell. The spirit of truth had
touched her---but still she resisted. There was one more
appeal. I desired a private interview. I entreated her
not to put me to it. Nay, I would have forborne; but I
dared not. I spoke a few words---no matter what they
were---they related to an event in her own life---it is a
secret, that will die with me. She knew not that any
other human being, except her aunt Matilda, perhaps,
had any suspicion of the truth. I demanded certain
papers
.
Her countenance fell. I was appalled by the
expression
.
She put her hand to her heart---and turned,
as I thought, to her writing-desk, for the purpose of
delivering
the papers---when I saw her take something up
---raise her arm---and, the next moment, some liquid
spurted into my eyes. I was blinded---but, when I came
to my sight, I found that my hands were red. It was
blood---I could not be deceived---I had seen it before.---
She was lying upon the floor; and the cry of
murder
, was
ringing in my ear.
The people of the house entered--and, seeing my face
and hands bloody, and Jane lying at my feet, they never
waited a moment; but attempted to pinion me. I was in
no mood for such trifling. Should she die, what might
be the consequences? There was only one course. It was
a desperate one. I plucked out my knife---I brandished
it. Stand back! I cried---I will bury this in the
heart of the first man that lays a finger on me, or
speaks;---yet, I will not attempt to escape. Hear me!---
Jane, hear me! Declare that I am innocent of thy death
---this moment!---this moment!---or, by the God that
made me, I will proclaim thy
Stop!---stop!---for heaven's sake, stop!---cried
Matilda
;
who was among the people that rushed in at the
cry of murder---She is trying to speak, now---leave
her to me.
Speak out, then, I cried, at once!--
Speak!
or
He is innocent;---it was my own hand!
---said the
poor creature; and instantly died away, as I thought,
forever.
She recovered, however, a little, during the night.
But circumstances rendered it necessary, that nobody,
but Matilda and I, should watch with her. We did.---
And you may believe me---I have passed some terrible
nights---many, many!---that few men would have
survived
;---but
never did I pass a night---no, never!---so
frightful and alarming as that. But I obtained what I
wanted---the papers.
She is now a wreck. God forgive her!---God, in his
infinite mercy! And may her death-bed be a terrour to
them, that give ay to any headlong passion. Having
said this, he left me.
Such is the death of that extraordinary woman, Sarah.
She was sorry, and very penitent, before her death, for
all that she had done to Juliet; retracted a long and
grievous fabrication about her; and signed it with her
own blood---and, finally, forgave Molton, and blessed
himfor what? I cannot imagine. What was that
tremendous secret? Whence had he that power over
her? I cannot imagine. Good night---I am sick, and
weary, and dark---such a death-bed!
J. OMAR.
vol. ii. I
EDWARD MOLTON TO GEORGE STAFFORD.
The disorder has terminated. Another
victim---another
woman---queen-like and beautiful---made for
dominion---have
I seen, at my feet, weltering in her own
blood. Another human being---another!---by the same
dark and unsparing fatality, which has pursued me from
my childhood, have I been the means of destroying,
without
even wishing for it. How is this, Stafford? How
are we to account for that appetite for blood, which
some men seem to have from nature? How are we to
account, too, for that unerring certainty, with which a
rebellious spirit is made to perform, whether it will or
not, when it imagines itself the furthest from it, too, the
decrees of heaven? I have just awakened, as from a long
trance. I look at my almanackat the papers that lie
before meand their dates would persuade me, that I
have been asleep, or worse, for many weeks. Helen
tells me, to be sure, that I have been very sick,
very
but she does not tell me the truth, I fear. Stafford, I have
been mad. Two months have passed, since I stood by
a woman, who slew herself in my presencewhose hot
blood spouted from her very heart, upon my lips and
nostrils. My brain turned on the spot. I have just
recovered
and
all that has passed, for many a month,
appears
to me, like a dream. Nay, were it not for a
certain
feeling in my side; and certain spectres, that beset
me, continually, sleeping or waking, I should be brought
to question, very seriously, my own identity. Stay, I
shall be unable to finish this, to-day. I must put it by;
and when I am more entirely myself, I will renew the
subject, upon which I wrote you last. What was it,
Stafford? It is a long, long time since. Was it not
theology
?
Or was itYes, it
was
painting. I
remember
it, now.
ED. MOLTON.
SARAH TO JULIET.
O, Juliet, I thank you, a thousand, and a thousand
times, for your last kind letters. They came almost
together
on
account of some irregularity in the mail, I
suppose. But why have I not heard from you, of late?
Three months, nearly, since your last! Is the illness of
Mr. Grenville so serious, that you cannot spare a line,
dear? Perhaps a warmer climate would be a relief to
him; and, I am sure, that, in the approaching cold
weather
,
you would find it altogether more agreeable to be
in Charleston, than New-York. It is the Montpelier of
America, I am told; nay, I have experienced it;only
think how delightful it is, to breathe an air of perfume
and warmth, in the very depth of December; to have the
honeysuckle and jasmine in blossom about you; and to
hear the waters gushing musically through the earth,
tread where you will, like subterranean melody
visible
musick, running in a steel-coloured, glittering labyrinth;
among the grass, and star-lit fountains. Staythis
will never do. If I rave at this rate, you will think that
there
is
something serious, in the influences here. But
do not alarm yourself. The drawing master is gone.---
He came one day, and bade me good bye, with an air
that was very becoming to him. I was quite affected,
I declare, at the parting; for, every day, he was
discovering
some new and strange propertyso that I had
begun to find his society very necessary to me. Yes,
Juliet
,
I am serious; and I never think of him, of late,
without
becoming more so. He has gone to Boston; and
really, in a manner, and after a fashion, so entirely his
own, that I never think of it without laughing. Let me
tell you how it was. He had returned to Hallowell, it
appears, where a class of young ladies had been
forming
for him, whil he was here. They were fine,
intelligent
,
charming women, he says; and nothing would
have given him more pleasure, than to remain and teach
them, if his conscience would have permitted him to do it.
I smiled to hear him speak of conscience. But he
soon set me right; and, in three minutes, the tears stood
in my eyesfor which I have been heartily ashamed
ever since. His manner was inexpressibly solemn and
affecting;he acknowledged that he had trifled with
sacred
things; that he had spoken irreverently of the
scriptures;but, heretick as he was, (for he was of the
faith of them that worship
one
God, and
one
only,) he
had yet some sense of religionsome of dutysome of
conscience. Nay, said heand, extravagant as it
was, I could not, for my soul, disbelieve himNay,
said he, though I am cheerful, rash, and headstrong; yet,
what I believe to be my duty,
that
will I do;---and if my
life were, this moment, necessary to the happiness of
mankind; or, if God signified to me, that the sacrifice
would be acceptable to him, this moment would I lay it
down; but I would lay it down in my own way---only
from the conviction of my understanding. My
martyrdom
should be my own.
I was distressed, Juliet; and, before I knew it, had
shaken hands, and parted with him, wishing him all the
happiness in the world, half a dozen times, at least:---
and then, after all that, what do you think happened?
Why, we sat down together, before a comfortable fire,
and talked for a whole hour! He appeared to be in
excellent
spirits; yet, every minute or two, the
conversation
would flag---and his countenance, which is really
noble, at times---full of meaning and soul---would change
its whole expression, to an air so abstracted and
melancholy
,
that I was sure his festivity was unnatural to him;
and that I had never seen his true character till that
moment. A silence would follow; for I preferred
watching
his
face, to entertaining him with my tongue; which
he would interrupt, every moment, by some sprightly
sally, uttered at random, as if
his
thought were in
another
world---on times long gone by---or wandering into
futurity.
But, he has gone; and my days hang heavily upon me,
now. I had just begun to learn his real charactera
man of deep, but secret pietyproudcarelessand
unhappy. I shall never forget his haughty blue eyes;
nor their strange tenderness one nightwhenbut
no, let me change the theme.
Stay---I began to tell you of the manner, in which he
left us. I shall try to tell the story in his own words, if
possible. I went to Hallowell, and began my school;
but it would not do. Not that I did not get well paid,
and plenty of employment; but my conscience would not
be quiet. Among others, I have taught an amiable and
sweet child, in a dozen or twenty lessons, how to colour,
shamefully too,
one
picture! It was wretchedly done;
and I never saw it without a spasm of the heart,
particularly
as I did not know what I was after, myself; nor
how to amend my own blundering; the chief notion that
I had of colouring, had been taken from the red, blue, and
orange pictures, or
tables
, as they were called, over
looking-glasses. Another constant trial, said he, was
this:---There were a family of intelligent and
accomplished
girls in the neighbourhood, who, I have no doubt,
had learnt the art properly; and, as they visited at this
house, I was fearful that every hour would capsize me.
These were the only coloured lessons that I gave; for
the others, I had less fear---they were either in pencil
drawing only, or Indian ink; and were, really, quite as
tolerable as any that I had seen. How, indeed, was I to
protect myself? There was only one way. I spoke of
mine as a new style---Italian, of course---scorned all
the older fashions; and ridiculed all the common
methods
,
(of which I was supremely ignorant,) and
invited
comparison
. This saved me. Every body could see a
difference
, and every body took it for granted that the
difference was in my favour. I continued to eat and
drink well, it is true, with my earnings; but I could not
sleep
. I felt that I was a scoundrel;---and so, one day,
while this uncomfortable feeling was upon me, I
happened
to pop into a little room, appropriated to the
Washington
Benevolent Society
; and to reading. I took
up a paper. I saw an advertisement for a person, to
conduct
a wholesale and retail store, in Boston; good
recommendations
to be required, &c.---the latter of which
I knew that I might have, from anybody in my native
town, if it were only to get rid of me. I, immediately,
wrote to the printer, with the air of an old acquaintance,
vol. ii. I 2
signing my true name---for it was impossible, I knew,
that a man should remember the names of all that had
been introduced to him; and my manner was exactly
calculated to make him suppose that we were well
acquainted
,
and that
he
had forgotten my name. The truth
is---I had never seen the man in my life. I had never
been in Boston, except once, when I ran away, and got
lost, of a Sunday evening, in State-street---I wish I could
stop to tell you all about it, but I cannot---and nearly
ruined my poor master, who, to save expense of agency,
had commissioned me to buy a handful or two of goods;
under which authority, as his letter of credit was not
limited. I took the liberty to buy whatever I took a
fancy
to---and left him to sell them, and pay for them, as he
could---charging him with all the expenses of the
journey
,
into the bargain! Well, I requested the printer,
that I mentioned, to tell the advertiser that I was his
man, when I knew his terms.
This morning I have received a letter, from a man,
that says, Come to me directly. If we can agree, well;
if we cannot, I will provide you with board, till you can
find a place to suit yourself.
I like this proposition---and as I have a prodigious
hankering not to die a fool; an event that inevitably
happens to a New-Englander'---(yes, Juliet, the
creature
is a
yankee!
)---who dies, without having seen
Boston
,
I have been about taking leave of my scholars, and
shaking hands. I have received some blessings---a few
tears, which were very precious to me---and about twice
as many dollars, that were, at least, quite as
indispensable
;
and now, Miss Ramsay, farewell! I hope that we
may meet again.
I hope so, said I. I
do
hope so, indeed. If you
should write to any body here---and I know that you are
a favourite with Dr. Plumber, and lawyer Kidder---for
a bad reason, too, I hear; that of telling a good story---
A reason that I am ashamed of; and have done with,
forever, said he, interrupting me.
If you should write to either of them, I shall be
gratified
to learn that you are well.
His eyes sparkled.
And there is
another
, said I, archly, I thought, but
be did'nt seem to think so, for he frowned---and
departed
.
Farewell, Juliet. I am impatient to hear from you.
S. R.
SAME TO SAME.
Juliet, I am thunderstruck. Read the enclosed letter,
and tell me, candidly, if I am to blame. I wrote to you
yesterday, but to-day's post has brought me this; and,
full of trepidation and uneasiness, I hasten to
communicate
to you, that---no---no, Juliet, you are now a married
woman, and I cannot deal so freely with you, as I used.
A strange thought just occurred to me; but, I must
watch this tendency to the romantick; it will make me
ridiculous some day or other. I look at it, again. I
compare
it. There
is
, certainly, a resemblance in the
writing
.
But, what writing? Indeed, my dear, I cannot
tell you; unless, by some chance, I should meet this Mr.
Randolph, again; when, I am determined to know who and
what he is. Behold his letter. I have not answered it,
of course; and I had opened it, before I suspected that
it was his; or, most assuredly, I should have returned it
to him, at once, in a blank envelope. But, I had read
it; and, after reading it, that would have been affectation
and cruelty. No, I could not so rebuke him, now. I
might, at first; but I should not dare to do it, now,
without
deep consideration. Perhaps he took my last words
as a
hint
to write to mebut I hope not.
SPENCER RANDOLPH TO MISS RAMSAY.
Boston
, .
That you may know, at once, all that you have to
apprehend
,
Miss Ramsay, I have chosen to write my name
in the very top of this letter.
It is from Spencer
Randolph
. Have you the courage to proceed?the
magnanimity? If you have, let me counsel you to
proceed
.
You will find nothing to make you repent of it.
But, if you trembleif you have not the fullest confidence
in yourself, and meI pray you, I entreat you, to return
it. Do not proceed. If you domark meyou will
have contributed directly to an event, of which you do
not even dream at this moment. Yes, if you read this
letter, that event will certainly happen. Dare you go
on? Yes, you will.
You are, probably, distressed at the liberty that I have
now taken. You ask yourself, what I have seen in your
conduct to encourage me. I answer nothingnothing,
Miss Ramsayor nothing, except your independent
tone of feeling, and sound practical good sense.
They
have encouraged me. I do not deny it. But, to do what?
Not to violate any duty, any law, even of decorum; not
to intrude myself, unbidden, upon the thought of a
woman
,
that I respect. No. What then? Merely to
converse
to
hernot even
with
her. I do not ask you, Miss
Ramsay, to reply to me.
That
were more than I could
expect, even from your independence. I only ask you
to
listen
. Is there any fallacy in this? You have not
been afraid to
listen
to my conversation. Are you afraid
to
read
it. But the world may know it. And is that a
reason, Miss Ramsay, why we should not do what is
innocent
?
The world know that I have conversed with
you; that I have visited you; and that you have received
me kindly. Was there any danger in this? No. Any
reproach? No. Is there more peril now, that I shall
corrupt or poison you, by my writing? Then why any
fastidiousness?
Reflect for yourself. What makes those men, who
associate
habitually with women, superiour to others?---
What makes that woman, who is accustomed to, and at
ease in, the company of men, superiour to her sex in
general? Why are the women of France so universally
admired and loved for their colloquial power? Solely
because they are in the habit of a free, and graceful, and
continual conversation with the other sex. Women, in
this way, lose their frivolity; their faculties awaken;
their delicacies and peculiarities, emit their own
perfume
;
and unfold all their beauty and captivation, in the
spirit of intellectual rivalry. And the men lose their
pedantick, rude, declamatory, or sullen manner. The coin
of the understanding, and the heart, is interchanged
continually. Their asperities are rubbed off; their
better
material polished and brightened; and their richness,
like fine gold, is wrought into finer workmanship by the
fingers of women, than it ever could be, by those of men.
The iron and steel of our character, are hidden, like the
harness and armour of a giant, in studs and knobs of
gold and precious stone, when not wanted in actual
warfare
.
In England, men show their own estimate of female
conversation, by never exposing themselves to it, if they
can help itpreferring the bottle to itthe race-course
the gambling table
clubs
and routeswhere women
are never seen, or never expected to
converse
. In France,
men adjourn from the table, like rational creatures, to
the
parlour
, the very name of which is a compliment to
the women, where they sit and converse with rational
females, from choiceor flirt with irrational ones, for
amusement. But, in England, how is it? The men drive
the women from the table; and sit, and guzzle wine, till
they can't see out of their eyesrather than listen to
their conversation.
Have I said enough? Will you permit me to write to
you? You have nothing to fear. I shall do it hut
seldom
;
and will never offend you. I anticipate your
answer
.
You hesitateyou are undecided; but, at length,
you will consent. I foresee that you will; and I thank
you for it. If I should be mistaken, you have only to
return one of my letters,
unopened
, and you will never
hear from me, again.
I am now in Bostonprobably, behind the counter of
the greatest scoundrel in it. I have just learnt
that
fact;
and shall leave him, immediately. Not an hour has
passed, since I was on the point of throwing him out of
his own window, into his wife's lap, (a charming woman,
by the way,) as she sat, working muslin, at her own,
just opposite, with a narrow alley between us.
He charged me with having done something
underhanded
.
It was an unlucky wordand I insisted upon
an explanation. Happily, for him, he thought of one.
Did'nt I pass you, the other day, said he, when you
were writing at the desk? And did'nt you, as I passed,
put your hand
over
the paper, to conceal it? Your hand
was
over
itthe paper was
under
it;was'nt that
underhanded
work, then?
What could I say? Nothing. So, I shall leave him,
in about an hourto do, God only knows whatfor, I
have fallen acquainted with a young haram-scarum chap,
with more money than brains, who has a prodigious
notion of going into business.
I shall write to you, again, one day or otherfor, it
is in vain to deny it, next to the pleasure of talking, is that
of writing another to death. There is this great
advantage
,
too, in writing, over conversation---that I can take
up just as much time as I please, without the risk of
being
interrupted, and have the talking all to myself.
But, I cannot bid you good bye, without telling you
how I got the recommendation required, from the people
of my native town. They were cautious fellows; and,
much as they desired to be quit of me, yet there was no
knowing what might happen on my way to Boston; and
it would be, they thought, rather an awkward thing to
read, that a young man was taken up, on suspicion of
some fact, or other, (though, if they had known me well,
they would never suspect me of anything like a
fact
,) in
whose pocket was found a paper, recommending him to
all whom it might concern, signed by several
respectable
merchants of . I don't say where, for I
have still some respect for my native town, and for the
mother that bore me.
Well, as soon as I was ready to depart, I went round
to every man that I thought sufficiently a stranger to me,
for my purpose; and asked him, resolutely, to give me a
certificate of my worth, and talent, and
probity
(not
property
I beg that you will be careful how you
pronounce
that wordfor I never was so far gone as to
demand
such
a certificate)and all that. They hemmed
and hawedand invited me to call againas often as I
pleased:in some places, a partner was outin others,
a principaland some did'nt know what to writeand
some could'nt write at all. I saw that all were afraid to
begin; so, I sat down, and wrote a recommendation of
myself
, and thrust it into the first man's face that I
caught, with a countenance that proved to him, that it
was better to sign anything, than put me to the trouble
of calling again. In this way, by downright travail of
spirit, I obtained six signatures.
With them, I arrived in Boston:and, the next
morning
,
at day-light, my temples throbbing with the noise
of the streets; and my feet smarting and sore with the
pavement, I found out the wholesale and retail store.
The prospect, I confess, was none of the pleasantest, at
first;and, before I made myself known to the master,
one of the most orthodox of human creaturesundergoes
family prayer, regularly, every night, without
considering
it in my salaryand locks his very kittens apart
male and femaleand cheats, like no man on earth,
except
himselfI ascertained that his assortment of goods,
at
wholesale
, consisted of refuse looking-glasses
Attlebury-jewelry
tea,
by the poundremnants of calico
and the fag end of all the auction rooms in
Christendom
.
Yet, I enlisted. Don't you pity me? We struck a
bargain directly.
Adieu, Miss Ramsay.Heaven bless you!
SPENCER RANDOLPH.
MOLTON TO STAFFORD, IN CONTINUATION.
I am altogether better to day, dear Stafford, than I
have been for a whole week; better in health, and better
in spirits. I am thinking to pay you a visit soon
perhaps
before the winter is fairly set in.
Let me commence then with the paintings of our
country
,
just as they occur to me.
At Faneuil Hall, Boston, I remember having seen a
noble picture of Washington, full length, with his horse,
and perhaps a negro, by Stuart. There was little to
astonish one in itexcept that it was Stuart's.
And not long after, there was a picture called the
Landing of the Fathers, painted by a Col. Sargeant of
that place. I saw it---but I was a boy then, and the only
recollection I have now of it is, that all the faces
appeared
to have been taken from the same study. It is now
destroyed, by some accident, I am told; or, such at least
is the impression upon my mind---I cannot pretend to
judge of it from such a recollection; for I was then too
young and too ignorant to know whether there was any
merit in it or not---but the same artist has just painted a
piece called the
DINNER PARTY
, after the manner of the
Capuchin Chapel, which I am told, is so admirable as
to deceive dogs; or, at least, one dog. The creature, it
is said, had been taught to stand upon its hind legs, and
beg, when it came near the table; and that, when it
entered
the room, where this picture was exhibited, deceived
probably by an admirable painted imitation of the smell
of roast beef---it arose as usual, and stood on its hind
legs. I have not seen the picture, but have heard that it
is a singularly spirited and effectual delusion.
[6]
[6]
Alas!I have just seen his MESSIAH ENTERING JERUSALEM. It is a
national
reproach. The man does'nt understand the alphabet of his art; not even the
elements
.
He is ignorant of lineal and serial perspectivedrawingcolouringand
grouping
.
He does'nt even know how to mix his paints. The faces are copied from printsand
have no common expressionno unity of designtell no story at all. There is not even a
fine passage in itexcept at the left-the sky and a groupnearly at the same distance as
another
group, about half the
same
height. There is no common centre-no place of attraction or
repose. The Saviour is drunkand the people so crowded together, and so distorted, that you
are convinced that he began in the fore ground, and worked in the faces, wherever he could
find a blank, any howto fill upin profile, or frontup or down. Not a foot is to be seen
why? He could'nt paint a footnot a hand, that is'nt either without an ownertoo far
from the bodytoo largeor totally out of drawing, and destitute of expression. It is, I
say it again, a shame and a reproach to the country.
Ed
.
You
remember
the curtain and fruit. Do you believe the story?
I can tell you something like it, within my own
experience
.
An old maid lived in my mother's family---who
had a mortal antipathy to cats, and took snuff in such
quantities, that, when she hung any of her clothes out in
the wind, it would set the whole neighborhood a
sneezing
:---nay,
although she has been buried many years, yet,
it is said to be impossible to go by the grave to this day,
without saluting it with the same noise. She had her
picture painted. It stood upon a chair, in a room dimly
lighted. In the next room she had found a young
kitten
,
which she whipped out of her presence with her
snuffy pocket handkerchief. The poor kitten ran, for her
life, half blinded and choking, into this room---there
she paused, for a single moment, to recover herself,
when, happening to see the picture, she squawled out,
jumped up, all four of her feet from the floor, and darted
by it, like a devil.
Butseriously, dear StaffordseriouslyI must take
up the subject, more magisterially.
At New-York, I know of nothing worth attention
in the way of painting, except a painting of Trumbull's,
whose
least
pictures are always
the greatest
. But when
you get to Philadelphia, there are several pictures, by
Mr. West himself. The first is Opheliaa tame, badly
contrived, feeble thing. The next is Lear in the
Tempest
;
a grand conception, with some gigantick features
in it;but crowded and encumbered to such a degree, as
to make you feel uncomfortably, while standing before
it. The drapery is beautiful; nay, it is more than
beautiful
;
it is magnificentbut heavy and unnaturally
voluminous
.
About the old King's legs are wrapped and
muffled such a weight of it, as, you are sure, no mortal
man could support. Yet it is kinglythere is no
denying
that. The character is well developed in Lear's
face; and his attitude is full of wrath, terrour, dominion
and madness. But the features are all marvellous
preternaturaland the hands too large,and the folds
of heavy cloth, swelling in the wind, are contradictory;
for example, there is a garment of blood colour, swaying
off from one of the left hand figures, as if the tempest
blew from the right;yet, over the head of the same
person
,
another fold is blown, by the wind, in a direction
exactly
opposite---as if the wind came from the
left
.
vol. ii. K
The next thing that I remember there, is
Christ
healing he sick
. To judge of it, you must read
the beautiful criticism which I enclose to you. It is
printed in a pamphlet form; and
given
to every visitor
for
twelve and a half cents
. This picture is the pride
of Philadelphia, and almost of America: and it would be
thought little better than blasphemy for one to imagine
any fault in it. Yet some how---it were difficult to tell
why---perhaps, in the mere spirit of contradiction; for it
is our nature, when we see people at one extreme, to fly
exactly to the opposite one, that our rebuke, of
their
extavagance
,
may be the more forcibly feltI could see
little to wonder at in this marvellous pictures. I
happened
to visit it, while it was the fashion to be in raptures---at
anything, and every thing, with that cold hearted,
calculating
people. A gentleman---exceedingly
pretty-behaved---rhetorical
and travelled too, I found, was holding
forth, to the utter discomfiture of many that knew more
than he, of painting, to a circle of women. Nobody
interrupted
him---nobody contradicted him;---and every
one that heard him, seemed to echo his thought. This
put me to thinking. He was noisy. I was silent. His
countenance---it was really a fine one---was breaking
out into continual sunshine---but
his
heart was
unaffected
.
He had come to declaim, not to criticise---to play off
the connoisseur, not to
feel
. I had just finished reading
the pamphlet. He approached me---for there was an air
of discontent, I am sure, in my countenance; and, as I
had been one of the most patient of his listeners---he
felt somewhat flattered. What a pity, I thought, that
he cannot read my heart, at this moment.
Is'nt it the finest thing in the world, sir! said he---
I see that you have studied it, with attention--an amateur
---an artist---if I may be so bold, sir---I---pray
a---a.
I looked at the man---very calmly---and he stopped,
where he was, with a low bow; yet, unwilling to be
utterly disconcerted, he prepared to carry it off, with the
air of one, that was only amusing himself with another.
Sir, said I---you have put me to it. I shall speak as
plainly as you.
That is not a great picture
. It is full of
faults---and the critick, he who wrote
that
book, never
saw the picture. I am sure of it. Somebody, the artist
himself perhaps, employed him, and described his own
intention
. Hear me for a moment.---The criticism is
beautiful, very vigorous and original---but see here. The
critick says, that the brightest ray of light, issues
between
that index finger and thumb;---and that the light
passes off from that, into the
chiaro oscuro
. It is false.---
There
is the brightest ray of light,---exactly where it
ought
not
to be,---about the golden candlestick. The
critick says, that the power of Mr. West, is to be seen
chiefly in his daring exhibition of contrast;---and that,
he has opposed the beautiful neck of a youthful woman, to
the emaciated and shrunken aspect of an old man, her
father, whom she supports. Look at itis
that
a
beautiful
neck? Is it not cadaverous, wasted,unlovely
and
properly
sofor, has not the daughter been
watching
by the bed side of her poor sick father? Thus then,
that
neck is not beautifulnor should it be so. But turn
your eyes there, to the left;and there you see one of the
most beautiful necks in the worldcontrasted with the
hand of an old man, resting upon the daughter's head.
That was the
contrast
, of which the artist gave the
critick
noticebut the critick, never having seen the
picture
,
committed that ridiculous blunder. And here too
he speaks of the appearance of returning life, in the
extremities of the sick man, as they are approaching the
Saviour. A beautiful thought, I confessbut I look in
vain for the appearance. Can you see anything of it?
I cannot, I confess.
Againthe critick dwells, with singular emphasis,
upon the sublime conception, and desperate courage of
Mr. West, in opposing the light, which flows from the
head of the Saviour, to that which flows from the golden
candlestick, the
holy of holies
. An ordinary man would
never have thought of this, says the critick, and most
assuredly would never have risked them together. But
observe the thought. The holy of holies, is an emblem
of the Jewish dispensation. The light, from it, is faint
and dying. But, the lustre that escapes, like a vapour,
from the head of Christ, is made to overpower and
darken
the lustre of the former; showing, thereby, that, in the
light of the new dispensation, all the ritual of the old,
even in its brightness, waned and darkened. This would
be all very wellvery well, indeed; but the misfortune
is, that it is not true;nay, that the truth is exactly the
reverse. Instead of the light from the Saviour's head,
overpowering that from the candlestickthe latter
overpowers
the former! so that, it resembles more the sickly
splendour of corruption, than, the raying of divinity.
Now I object at once, and decidedly, to that notion of
encompassing Christ's head, or the head of an apostle,
or martyr, with a halo, or a glory. It isas if one should
write under it, Here is a saint or, Here is a Christ.
The power and beauty of Christ, must appear in his
countenance
,
and deportment; and not, in the foolish conceit
of a glory.
Look at his face, too. Is it Jewish? No.It is the
face of a handsome young Englishman. Look at the
balancing of his hands. Where is the benignity and
composure; the serenity and sweetness; or, the awful
beauty and grandeur of Christ, of which you have heard
so much? Not in that picture, I am sure. It is
crowded
too, to suffocation; the integrity,
wholeness
, and
singleness
of the piece, is broken up. Where is the
principal
figure?where does the eye seek, naturally, to
repose
?
Upon the centurion. What think you of
him?
the anatomythe attitude?Is it natural? Look at
the colouringthat dirty blue dress, of the Saviouris
that
what it should be?But why need I trouble you with
these opinions? You are a Philadelphian; and, though I
am sure that they are making their impression, even
while that smile is upon your lip; and that, when I am
away,
you
will probably change your opinion of the
picture
;
and, probably, see some of the very faults that
I have pointed out, yet, I cannot hope that you will
acknowledge
any of them nowand in this placein this
company.
But do you know the history of that painting?It is
a failurea miserable failure, for Benjamin West;
and the cause is a natural one. He was weary of the
subject. This was the third time that he had painted it;
and, in worrying himself for improvement, he has
spoiled
the unity of design. His first attempt was a mere
sketchbut was wonderful. It was the astonishment
and delight of Europe.It was only done up, in the
heat and vehemence of the conception, with brown and
white. But, after many years, he copied it, for the
purpose
of presenting it to the Pennsylvania hospital, as the
tribute of one, who was under some unaccountable
obligation
to that, or to the stateI do not exactly know
which. He finished it; but the Royal Academy offered
him three thousand guineas for it.
[7]
[7]
Noit was not
three thousand
guineas.
Ed
.
and a compliment into
the bargain. That was irresistable. They were
unwilling
to part with itthey wanted it as a perpetual study,
for the youthful; they did not pretend to offer three
thousand
guineas as its
value;
but, merely, as all that the
funds of the society would admit.So
that
picture,
which was worth a dozen of this, was
sold
to the
Egyptians
.
But his word had been givenand Mr. West,
as an honest man, felt obliged to redeem it. He
therefore
attempted to copy;but, he so altered, and qualified,
and diluted the spirit and simplicity of the second,
which was greatly inferior to the firstthat his third is
just what you see there.Good morning, sir.
Ladies, I wish you a very good morning.
There, dear Staffordit is bed timeand I shall take
up the subject again, soon.Good night.
ED: MOLTON.
P. S.The battle of North Point, &c. Ah, I had
quite forgotten your questions. But, will answer them
now, briefly. General Harper is a
great
general. I
say it seriously. I hold his military talent to be superiour
to that of any other man, in our country. He had little
to do therebut, that you may understand how much
generalship
there was exhibited, by them that had more to
do, I will mention one fact. They threw about two
thousand
vol. ii. K 2
menin advanceas a corps of observation
exactly
where they expected an attackfor what purpose?
to mask
all their own batteries!their whole line of
entrenchments
one
would think. The British were
expected
;
and, if they had brought this body to the charge, one
of two things must have been the consequence:every
man must have been bayonetted, or taken prisoner;or,
must have fallen back, upon the American lines,
with
the British
. They were the flower of Baltimorethe
young men; and, had the attack been made, the militia and
artillery would have been useless to the Americans; for
the lines would have been carried, at the point of the
bayonet
the
whole British army, at the heels of the two
thousand Americansentering with them; and the
artillery
would not have been used, by the Americans
for, they would be firing on their own men. Such,
was the
able
disposition after the battle at North Point.
Believe me, nothing but the accidental loss of General
Ross, saved the city of Baltimore; and yet, the Americans
were brave enough, and numerous enough, to
eat
the
British
,
had they been properly officered. I spoke with one
of the officers; a brave, obstinate fellow, who was among
this two thousand. He had resolved; when brought to the
charge,
not to retreatnot to fall back
but, if he
sacrificed
every man under his command, to break his way
through the enemy. The plan was a desperate one; but,
it was the only one, that could have saved the main
body; and would have been carried into execution. A
victory!
pshawwe had better hold our tongues about
the matter. It is a national reproach to us, that we
did not take your whole army prisoners. We
should
have done it, but for two or three blundering militia
commanders.
JOHN TO SARAH.
Philadelphia
, .
I have just arrived, dear Sarah;and, from the hour
of my departure, until my landing at Jamaica, I had
never
an opportunity of sending you a line, or explaining
the cause of my absence. Frank was sickand the
boat that brought me the letter, was ready to sail again,
before I received it. In an hour I had embarked; and
now I hope that you will forgive my long silence, and be
charitable to
me
, and kind, and tell me all that has
happened
to you, in that cold climate of yours. Mr.
Grenville
suffers, cruelly; and he has just determined to visit
the Havana.Juliet would go with him; but her health
is very delicate, about this time, and he will not
permit
her to think of it.
Her deportment is full of the most piteous and tender
solicitude; every movement of her lip; every emotion
of her face, is earnest with affection, altogether unlike
the timid eyeing, and passionate low-breathing, of Juliet
Gracie. There is a composure now, in her very sweetness;
a dignity, a serene, womanly self-possession, altogether
worthy of Juliet Grenvilleand her husband is so
conscious
of all this; so grateful for it, that I can hardly look
upon him, feeble and wasted as he is, without a feeling
of envy. Upon my word, Sarah, when I gaze about me,
and find two such women as Juliet, andmay I name
her?Helenso full of love and watchfulness, so
beautiful
and so sincereone, all passion and enthusiasm; the
other all mildness and purity, with a spirit of
trancendent
power, tempered only, not extinguished, by
gentleness
yet,
both loving, almost to adoration, the men of
their heartsO, I could lay me down and weep for
melancholy
,
that there is no such woman for meno dear
one, who will watch the changing of
my
countenance, as
something upon which her destiny is dependentthe
deepening of my lipsor eyesas matter essential to
the comfort of her heartno blessed one, to whom I can
turn in sorrow and desolation, and feel her soft arms
twining about my neckher warm cheek upon mine,
and her beautiful hair blowing about my eyes. Ah, no,
Sarah;there is to be no such luxury for me. I have
lived and mingled with the world; communed and dwelt
with many women; lovely and innocent onesand
counterfeited
many passions; but never to this hour, have I
found one to love menever;and I shall go to my
grave, unhonoured and unknown; no woman to weep for
my memory; no children to bless menone to
remember
that I have been. Year after year, hath passed away;
and many have stood up before me, thrilling with
passion
for one another, and received the benediction of love;
yet I have been, forever, desolate and alone. No heart
ever beat against mine; no lips ever tingled with the touch
of mine;no step ever faltered; no voice ever changed,
when mine was heard. Yet, what have I done? Who
can charge me with ought of impurity or licentiousness?
Why then are my faculties wasting awaythe
inexhaustible
tenderness of my heart, like a secret fountain,
left unbroken and unvisited, to sink into the sand
feeling
no emotion, creating none. Is it that I have been too
good? Can it be, that, to women, there is a witchery
and enchantment in the aspect of profligacy. The
licentious
are belovedthe wicked are marrieddoated on,
to distraction and death. The sound of
their
voice thrills
like electricity, through many a pure heart; the glance
of
their
eye penetrates and dissolves. At the touch of
their hand
, soothed, and subdued, the lovely and wise,
bow down their heads to the dust; loosen their tresses;
and weep to be embraced.O, Woman! What a lesson is
this to the virtuouswhat discouragement to self-denial
and greatness. Can it be true, that, familiarity with the
profligate, hath a spell for the faculties; and that he, who
hath spoiled and rifled many a precious heart, is,
therefore
,
more seductive and winningmore courted, even
by the virtuous and pure;for the enchantment of his
manner, perhapsfor his reformation, it is
said;
and as
a
trial?
But is it not a lesson to the
good
doth it not
teach
them
, that there is an attractiveness in manner, to
be sought after, unlike the austerity of virtuean
attractiveness
that is delirium to woman. Shall the wise and
good learn thisor shall they abandon it to the
dishonourable
and profligate?Sarahis it not the fault of
women, that virtue is ashamed to show its face; that it
is obliged to counterfeit the deportment of vice, ere it can
obtain admission to woman? Is it not a reproach to
you? And is it not true? Who are her favourites?
What their history? Is it not full of seduction and death?
Deliberate villany, and idolatrous passion? It is. And
who are rejected and abandoned?The tame and
spiritless
?the
unfashionable?They are the men that live,
as men ought to livemen, that feel their accountability
to heaventhat approach woman with a breathless awe,
ready to bleed and die for herbut unable, in the
faintness
of their heart and voice, to trifle with her loveliness;
trembling in her presence, as if in the temple of
something
consecratedfaltering at her approach, like them
that are conscious of angelick visiting, or invisible
guardianship
;afraid
to
imagine
aught that is earthly or
sensual. Yet!such men are ridiculedtheir
veneration
laughed at; and themselves shunned. They are
rightwomen are right---the presence of such men is a
perpetual and burning sarcasm upon them.---Who that
hath so much of mortality and infirmity, as women, could
endure to be approached, by such infatuated and
mistaken
worshippers. Every ascription of praise is an insult.
If the heart stop in its awe---there are cruelty and
bitterness
in it; for what can be more cruel and bitter, than to
approach a woman as if she were something more
spiritualized
,
more etherial, than the daughters of earth. Is
it not saying that she ought to be---what she is not. It
is burning incense to Chastity, before the image of Mary
Magdalene, or the woman of Samaria.
Farewell
,
JOHN OMAR.
JULIET TO SARAH.
Yeshe did take it for an invitation; nor, was it
wonderful
.You
did not mean it as one, I am convinced; but
you said about as much, dear Sarah, as that you would
be glad to
hear
from him. I have read his letter, with
perfect astonishment. It is the most impudent, familiar,
and presumptuous thing, that I ever saw. Did you not
think so? Shall you answer it? you
ask. Answer it?
You
answer that letter! Why, Sarah, I can hardly
believe
my senses; that, you should not have returned it,
instantly
,
is a matter of astonishment to me;
you
who have
been so cold and prudent:but that you should think of
answering
it;
that
is past my comprehension. You
were more intimate with him, than I had any suspicion
of; or, he has, beyond all comparison, the most
assurance
of any human being, to write you such a letter.
Perhaps I am too much in earnesttoo plain
spoken
.
I hope not, dear Sarah, for I would soothenot
irritate your poor heart, at such a moment. Who is
this Randolph?what is he?Sarah Ramsay cannot
answer
me that:no, not even Sarah Ramsay, that woman
of strength and decision; she, who was always so prompt
and energetick, and circumspect; yet, Sarah Ramsay is,
disquieted, when he hath left heracknowledges itis
anxious to see him again: repeats, with emphasis, his wild
and improbable talea tale, that shows him to be an
unprincipled
impostor, even if it be true: permits his hand
to rest upon her shoulder, for some minutes, without
being
aware of it;suffers him to swear, more than once,
in her presence;nay, repeats his profanity, levity, and
irreligion,and, finally, receives, reads, and does not
return
to him, a letter, which he had the audacity to
address
to her. Sarah, I thought that I knew you well.
I did not. There is something in your character,
recently
developed, which is new to me, unexpected, and
alarming. Am I taking too great a liberty?
Dear
Sarah
,
I will not believe it. The time is not yet come,
when, between Juliet and Sarah, the plain language of
truth and soberness, shall be offensive or hateful. I am
married too, you will recollect, my dear, strange sister
and
that
gives me many privileges, as a counseller and
matron. Who is this man? I ask again. I would
have you find out? but, I would never have him suspect
it. You affect to treat the matter with levity; you are
remarkably direct and ingenuous. Do not deceive
yourself; you are in danger; and, were I not sure of it,
I would not, for the world, awake you to the knowledge
of a secret so alarming. Yet, I must
Randolph is dear
to you
. Yet, you do not know it. Your heart was in
sorrow, and he came to it. You were lonely and
dependant
.
He kept up your spirits, and startled you, with
his originality. You were proud, and cold. He
determined
to subdue youby a careless indifference. He
has succeeded. You are more in his power, than he
dreams of. I am glad that he is gonevery glad. But
I give you no advice, dear;consult your own
understanding
be
prudent
, and leave the rest to heaven.
Examine your own heart, as with a knife; and then, my
own dear Sarah, let me pray you to act, as you would
have done, a year ago, had such an adventurer thrown
himself in your way. Am I unkind, uncharitable,
ungenerous
?
I cannot afford to be
generous
, my sister,
where, to give away aught of indulgence, is to give away
something of your happiness. I cannot be
charitable
, at
least, not
very
charitable, to such levity, assurance, and
avowed demerit as his. And, I must not be
kind
to
one, who has so unkindly; so unaccountably, too, let me
say, trespassed upon the solitary and benighted heart of
a proud, high-minded woman; yet, a woman, that was
sincerely pious; until she, herself, has learned to repeat
his impiety. Sarah, I know that I am severeand I
hope that it will be undeservedI hope so, indeed. I
would rather endure thy rebuke, in return, than that
thou shouldst deserve mine, for a single instant. It
makes my heart bleed, when I think, how lonely and
exposed
thou art. Yet, do not believe, Sarah, that I have
any feeling of hostility or resentment, against this man,
on account of his profession; or, that I would be angry
at his familiarity, because he is poor. Nomine is not
such pride. I respect poverty; but I would have the
poor man honest, and prudent; wise and religiousand,
I should not like him the less, for a little modesty.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
My poor husband is quite unwell. At timesoh,
Sarah, I am in need of consolation; and now that my
heart, which has been kept up till this moment, thinking
only of thee, is left to itselfI am almost blinded with
my tears. Grenville
is
unwell; and I am afraid that I
must lose him, for a time. How shall I exist
without
him, Sarah; and now, too, when the presence
of a husband is as necessary, almost, to my support
and sustenence, as the feeling that there is a God, and a
good God, forever about me. Perhaps I am in a
perilous
way, myself, dear Sarah. I have many fears; much
sickness at the heart, and strange tremours, that alarm
me, inexpressibly; the more, probably, from the fact, that,
in my present situation, it will be impossible for me to
accompany my husband abroad; and that in
his
, it will
be equally impossible for him to be with me, in the hour
of peril and agony.I have a melancholy foreboding,
Sarah; a superstitious apprehension upon me, that I am
ashamed of, even while I submit to it. The period, it
is true, is some what distant; but, I feel every blow of the
clock, upon my heart:nay,
within
it, like a creature,
waiting for death, and
certain
that it is at hand. Yet, these,
I am told, are the common apprehensions of women, in
my situation, for the first time. Every thing alarms
them; their
spirits
are forever in travail, and they suffer
inconceivably, in their anticipation. I wish that I were
wiser; more confident; and, at least, as well prepared for
death, as I have been. But nowO, Sarah, I cannot think
of it, without quaking. I am in health now; happy, loving
and beloved; and, if I die now, it will be suddenly;
without
that lingering, wasting, wearing preparation, which
reduced me, gradually, before. And yet, there is a
sweet thrilling in my veins; a rich, warm flooding of my
poor heart, at times, when I think how many have
escaped---how
many, that were weaker than Ihow many,
that think little of the peril;---and that, if I do escape, and
should be so blessed---O, merciful Father---let me but live
to embrace a creature that owes its little life to me, and
then
, O, noI could not
then
, consent to dieI
could not
it would break my heart, to think of leaving its
helplessness
,
to the mercenary. O, noif I must die, it were
better, perhaps, that I should die nownayI cannot
think even of that.Father!Father!thy will be done.
Do thou support and sustain me, in the coming trial!
Teach me to submit to it, whatever it be, unaided, and
alone, without repining! And, if it be, that I am to
endure
the agony of a mother, with no father, no husband
near me, to feel with me, to pray for me, to weep for me,
to support my fainting spirit, and bless the babe that is
born to himO, do thou,
thou!
O my Father, be with
me;
and let thy care be upon
him
, wherever he may be;
afar offand sorrowing, for his wife,O, wilt thou!

P. S.Why did you not send me the
original
of Mr.
Randolph's letter? Why copy it? Was it so precious,
so very precious to you?
EDWARD MOLTON TO GEORGE STAFFORD.
(In continuation.)
The next picture that I will attempt a description of,
dear Stafford, is the
Passage of the Delaware
, by
Mr. Sully, of whom I spoke the other day, in
enumerating
some of our portrait painters.
It is a spirited and beautiful conception, rapidly and
confidently wrought out; but was never meant for a
downright
historical picture. It is rather a
Portrait of
Washington
,
where the subordinate figures, and filling up, are not
sufficiently
subordinate, than
The Passage of the Delaware:
and the history of it is not a little amusing. Mr. Sully
was employed by the corporation of Charleston to paint
vol. ii. L
a portrait of Washington, after his own fashion: the
price was limited, and the space of unoccupied wall
assigned
,
beyond which, he could not trespass. Mr. S.
began his work; and, full of his natural enthusiasm
and fire, generated this picture, without any regard to
the paltry sum ($500, I believe,) which he was promised
for it. It was nearly finished, when, after some
troublesome
correspondence; and some revolution in the city
government, he had the mortification to find that this
picture, like that of the family of Wakefield, was
altogether
too big for the house. But, let us go back to the
time, when the proposal was made to him. What was
to be done? His profession was portrait painting;---he
had a large family to support; and, passionately desirous,
as he was, to employ his power upon the historical
department
;
to evolve the passions in all their shadowing
---to call up the apparitions of the past,---give
immortality
to the present---and summon, from the untenanted
chambers of futurity, the bodiless forms that are there:---
clothe them with flesh and muscle---infuse into them
meaning and passion---and give to them the noblest of
all expression---
dramatick individuality:
it was putting his
very existence at hazard, even to trespass, for a day, upon
the historical department. Once over the barrier, it would
break his heart to return; and yet, if he were not paid
for his labour, he would be oblige to return, at the peril
of starvation to a large family. Much as he panted
for adventure---these were reasons to deter him from it.
Yet---the time might come, he thought, when he could
loosen the bands that bound him, and unfetter his genius
---it might!---and where would be the peril, if he
ventured
abroad, a little, to
feel
the publick, in this portrait of
Washington, without actually invading the great
territories
of history. There would be some peril, to be sure,
in the hazardous ordeal, to which he would have to
expose
it, before a cold hearted, mercenary people; a
people
essentially ignorant of the art; and boastful of their
very ignorance. Yet---he resolved to encounter it all.
He made a noble picture. He threw in, with a confident
heart, a good quantity of bold, simple colouring; enough
of finish for the occasion; powerful association; and great
attitude---capital drawing---and that kind of repose in
the expression, which makes the heart of a man
thoughtful
,
in looking at the picture, as if himself were on the
precipice of some great adventure. He did
this---stepped
aside, and withdrew the curtain. Some people went
to see the
Passage of the Delaware
; and some a
PORTRAIT
of
George Washington
, at full length. Both
came away dissatisfied. It wanted the singleness, the
unity, and imposing reality of a portrait. And there
were not enough great features uniting, at once, in one
great expression, for historical painting. It was a
little
crowded, they said. (By
they
, I mean that class of
criticks, whom you may see, at exhibitions, looking
solemnly
through their own handsat
portraits
)much too
crowded. Truebut he was painting an embarkation:
and men are not very regular and formal, at such a
season
.
The manner of Washington, said they, is too full
of poetry; he is too youthful. Ah!thought Ithese
people
forget that Washington was only about forty years old
at the time. They compare him with Stuart's
Washington
,
who was twenty years older. These, with a
multitude
of other opinions, quite as ridiculous, went their
round for a time; and few even took the trouble to ask
themselves what had been the object of the painter. Had
they, they would have found that he had done all that he
attempted
. And what more could any man do?
After learning from the Charleston gentry that they
had made a
mistake
, in giving the dimensions, Mr. Sully,
as Mr. West had done before him, thought it right to
make a publick exhibition of the picture; for, in a
country
like ours, such a picture would never
sell
for a
quarter
of its value; and, unless an artist were rich enough to
amuse
himself, by painting pictures to give away; or, wise
enough to exhibit them for money, there would be no
encouragement
for him to labour here. But I doubt if he
has been even tolerably rewarded for it.
It would interest you, dear Stafford, to know
something
of his character, countenance, and history. Such
a knowledge gives value and interest to whatever a man
does. It is like going behind a curtain of creation; and
studying
the machinery of the universe. It is looking into
the elements of the human heart, before they are
compounded
or embroiled. Mr.
Sully
is a small, but remarkably
active, well-made man; with a countenance expressive of
a fiery spirit, pretty well subduedcourteous, mild, and
unassuming in his manner; and has, I do believe, one of the
kindest hearts in the world. His historyI wish I
were at liberty to tell you;---but, while it is infinitely
honourable to him, and no matter of confidence among
those who know him; yet, as it was communicated to me,
by a man, when his heart ran over, I do not feel myself
authorized to speak of itexcept in very general terms.
From other sources, I have learnt this,that his passion
for painting showed itself early; and that, when quite a
boy, he was on the point of abandoning it, forever, with a
feeling of discouragement and mortification; and was
only
prevented by a letter which he found, by accident,
just as he was about to embark, for a place, where he
meant to go into the naval service of this country. About
the same time, he left off miniature paintingupon which
he began; and, in which he had made some proficiency, in
consequence of meeting with an oil picture of Angelica
Koffman's. He placed it upon a tablestood before it
studied itfelt the inspiration that he had waited for
so long, flooding his whole heart, like a fountain,
suddenly
unsealed in a barren place. From that moment, he
devoted himself to oil portraits;and, not long after,
an event occurred to him, so honourable to human
nature
,
that, I must tell it. We have a tragedian here,
named Cooper. You have heard of him, perhaps. He
is a countryman of yours, by birth; but his education has
been with us. He is an ambitious man; full of heroick
and sublime movement upon the stage; and, from the
fact which I am about to communicate, I am as ready to
believe, as full of high hearted and generous feeling, off
the stage. He met Mr. Sully in a small city at the
South, and urged him to go to New-York. How shall
I go?said Mr. Sully. I am employed hereand
How are you off for cash? said Mr. C. without any
circumlocution.
Rather low, was the replya few dollars, and but
a few.
Well, thengive yourself no trouble about
that
. Go
to New-York. I will answer for your success; and, as
far as one thousand dollars will be of use to you, they
are at your service.
What was a proud, high-spirited fellow, full of
ambition
and passionate love, for his art, to do, in such a
case?
Mr. Sully accepted the offerwent to New York
succeeded;and was, soon after, sent out to London, by
subscription, to copy certain paintings of the ancient
masters. And here, another anecdote occurs to me, alike
honourable to another man; nay, to the whole species,
for it makes us think better of ourselves, and of all
mankind
,
when we find such beings about us. We are proud of
our relationship to such men. A gentleman, whom he met
at dinner, about the time of his departure for England,
in the course of a conversation, over the wine, with Mr.
S. begged him, if he were ever in the way of using it, to
draw on him, to the amount of five thousand dollars, (I
believe.) Mr. S. thanked the gentleman for his
kindness
,
and thought no more of it; but the next day, the
same person, (I forget his namebut he had been a man
of fortuneand is now, I believe, in the East Indies,
whence he will never return, until he be a man of
fortune
again,) called upon him. It was an offer, said
he, made of a Sunday; and at a dinner table. But, it
was not the less serious, for thatand I have come to
repeat it. I am not rich; but your drafts, to that amount,
shall be honoured.
Are not these things worthy of record, dear Stafford?
Should they ever be forgotten? It is to such menthe
noble of heartthe free and frankthat a country is
indebted
,
for its reputation. Theirs is the truest
munificence
.
It is the opulence of the heart.
There is another fact, in the history of this artist, that
you could not listen to;
you
, who are so romantick and
sublimated, in your conceptions of virtue and self-denial,
without locking your hands, and gasping for breath;
vol. ii. L 2
but I am not at liberty to relate itand I can only say,
that it was a deed of his own, and one of the most
heroick
,
unostentatious, and truly noble acts, that I have ever
heard of. That, alone, were enough to establish the
character of the
man
, forever, in my estimation.
Let us now look in upon Mr. Trumbull. You have
seen his
Sortie of Gibraltar
; and nothing that I
could say of it now, would be of any avail, to elevate it
in your opinion. It is his best picture. Indeed, his
Death of Montgomery; Battle of Lexington; Bunker
Hill, and all of his late pictures, are, altogether, not
worth so much as thatso vigorous, and so full of
action
,
as it is.
His
Declaration of Independence
, is a plain,
substantial affair, with an aspect of inveterate reality
about it; but exhibiting not one feature of sublimity, or
grandeur. The countenances are strong and varied;
but the awful gravity of wisdom and legislation; the
moment
of tremendous passiveness, when the travail is all
over; and the thought of liberty has become a
Declararation
of Independence
that
is not to be found in the
picture. There is no passionno majesty---no emotion;
and no especial seriousness, except in the sculptured
face of Samuel Adams; not so much, as you will see at
any long dinner table, when the dishes are all uncovered,
at once. You stand before it, without any feeling of awe
or delight. You see the interiour of an old-fashioned
apartment, with the light coming through the windows
behind---and a number of figures, seated and standing,
like men that think it about time to break up, and go
home to a comfortable bed. I wish, heartily, that I
could say something in favour of the picture; but I
cannot---it
does not deserve it. It is only a collection of
strongly painted portraits; assembled together, without
any common feeling or expression; but, as if by accident,
and just as well behaved-men may come together, any
where, without design.
The next is the
Surrender of Cornwallis
. On the
right of the picture, running off to a point, is a litter of
American troops; and, on the left, diminishing in the
same way, as if to make the perspective correspond, is
another litter of Frenchmen. They are all of a family.
All of his strong men, are strong with the same expression.
You are struck with a strange family likeness in the
whole. The first four or five faces, seem to be brothers,
at least, if not different views of the same head.
In the centre, is general Lincoln, mounted on a
beautiful
white horse, sitting to receive the sword, that a
British officer, general O'Hara, surrenders. The
common
notion is, that Washington, himself, received the
sword from the hands of Cornwallis. But neither
Washton
nor Cornwallis, was on the ground. General
Lincoln
was appointed to receive it, in the name of
Washington
,
from the representative of Lincoln's haughty
conquerour, Cornwallis; for, not long before, the latter
had meted to the brave Lincoln, a full measure of
unsparing
and bitter humiliation, at the south; and this
was the hour of retribution.
The first thing that strikes the eye, forcibly, is this
the unpleasant continuity of the lines; and the amazing
variety of attitudes, into which Mr. Trumbull has
thrown his horses' heads. One has a nose in the air
the next, his a little lowerand the third, a little lower
yetwhile a fourth, is biting his own knee, with his leg
advanced, and held, as if he had the cramp. This was
done, undoubtedly, to break the line; and to give more
action
to the picture; but the design is too evident. We
see the artit does not deceive us for a moment. Here
and there, too, are sundry ricketty and ill-formed horses,
that, as I live, Stafford, reminded me of nothing, except
the wooden cuts, in Geoffry Gambado's lessons for grown
horsemen. There is not one good horse in the picture,
except that in the centre; and his left fore hoof, is so
turned in, upon a spot in the canvass, of the same colour,
that it looks deformed and almost pointed; but the heads
of the horses are admirable. A singular defectone
that will make you smile, is apparent in allthey are
all
too low in the shoulder; their fore-legs are too short,
in almost every case.
His
Surrender of Burgoyne
, I lately saw. As I
live, Stafford, I begin to be ashamed of my countryman.
When I look at these three national pictures, for which
Congress have paid twenty-four thousand dollars; and
think of their being shown in the capitol, at Washington,
I could almost weep with shame and vexation. They
are, altogether, a reproach to the country; andI say
it deliberately, Staffordwere I in congress, I would
move for their being set fire to, before the great front of
the building, which they help to make ridiculous. I
cannot
trust myself to speak of this last picture, as I feel.
It is execrable. The heads are too big for the bodies.
There is neither dignity nor character in it. It looks
like bad tapestry, where a patch-work landscape is made
up of fragments, picked out of different pieces; where
the heads, cut out of old pictures, are pasted to bodies
and the bodies grouped by different people, each with a
design of his own. Col. Morgan, the rifleman, looks
like a target; and a captain from Connecticut, mounted,
for the purpose of showing his profile, has been made to
break his own neck; and general Burgoyne is tilting
over upon his nose.
Thursday
.
I have now done with Mr. Trumbull, lamenting that a
man of such strength, when young, should be, in his dotage,
or, if not in his dotage, that he should be contented with
such labour. There are now some other pictures,
particularly
of Mr. Alston, Leslie, and Morse, of which, were I
a little better acquainted with them, I would speak at
large. They were all pupils of Mr. West; or, at least,
students in the Royal Academy; and all, I believe, have
carried off some prizes. Mr. Morse, I know, had one;
and would have obtained another, had he remained in
the country,
with
his picture; for the rules of the society
required that. But he could not. The subject had been
given out to sixteen pupilsand he could not feel very
certain of the gold medal, whatever were the merit of
his picture; and, beside that, his father had been
pressing
him, with great earnestness, and for a long time, to
return home;he did return, leaving his picture, which
Mr. West, himself, afterward wrote to him, would have
obtained the prize, had
he
remained. Mr. West has
always
shown himself warmly disposed toward his young
countrymen; and all of them speak of him, with affection
and reverence. He it was, that influenced Mr. Sully to
abandon
copying;
and to begin manufacturing for
himself
,
while he was literally working, and starving
himself
to death, in London for some of his American
patrons
.
Was he not right? A man might as well hope to
learn how to make a poem, by
copying
poems, as a
picture
,
by copying pictures.
Mr. Morse's prize was obtained for the
Dying
Hercules
.
I have never seen it; but I have heard it spoken
of, as a bold and excellent piece of naked anatomybut
with too much convulsion in the sinews and flesh, even
for Hercules. It was first modelled in clay, by Mr.
Morse;nay, I believe that it was for that model, and
not for the painting, that he received the medal. But
his style is beautiful and warm; strong, rich, and
fanciful
.
His portraits, such as I have seen, were small, and
hastily done up; but they were excellent:and one,
making
a large picture, with some broken architecture, I
have dwelt upon, with great pleasure, again and again.
It was the portrait of a young girl of South Carolina,
where Mr. Morse has now gone to reside.
I have seen but two of Mr. Leslie's picturesand only
one or two of Mr. Alston's; and that so long since, and so
hurriedly, that I have not the heart to speak of them.

It was of Mr. Alston, that the affecting, simple little aneedote is told by Mr. Irving, in
one of his loose papers, published in the New Monthly, under the title of Recollections of
a Student.
He
was the American painter, whose dear companion had
left him
; whose
own wife had abandoned him, in a land of stranger, and gone alone into the skyleaving
him
alone
, upon the earth, unsustained, weary, and heart-sick, to waste his continual
inspiration
upon the darkness and emptiness of the world about him. Ah! who would not
have felt that she had
left
him, had the spirit of him (for the young wife of a young man
a man of genius and feelingis nothing else but the
spirit of him
) put out her bright wings,
all at once, without preparation, while they were journeying together, side by sideshook off
the dust of the earthand shot upwardjust as if she had been his guardian angel, only for
a little time; and had grown weary of her humanity. Who would not complain that she
had
left
him? Better to have been alone for ever,than after such a companionship!
Ed.
Mr. Alston stands in the very front rank of his
profession
;
and Mr. Leslie, when he first came out, was
considered
a marvel, and a prodigy. He had made a series
of beautiful, and singularly spirited sketches of Cooper
and Cooke, the actors; in which, the likeness and
character
of the men, were preserved with astonishing truth.
The people were mad about it; and he was sent abroad,
to becomea finished miracle. The result is, just what
might have been expected. He has ceased to astonish;
and, do what he will, he never can astonish again,
unless
he shall first become contemptible. He has a fine
genius; and may become great, in the romantick and
pleasant departments of the art; but I doubt much,
notwithstanding
all that has been said about him, whether
he have any peculiarity of genius for
great
painting. All of
his fmaily are addicted to itand nothing is easier than
to deceive one's self, on such a subject. A child, of any
sensibility, is perpetually shifting in its movement.
Today
,
he is flying kitesto-morrow, chalking out men
and women, or horses, upon the fencethe next day,
whittling with his pen-knifemaking houses of blocks
and boats of chipsand so on, foreveruntil some
day, he is brought to manifest a decided preference for
some one of these amusements.
If he should chance to sing, then his parents recal the
shrieking and squalling of his infancy, as so many
indications
of his genius for
musick
if he turn to drawing,
it is the same. All the old books and papers of the
household, that have been accumulating for years, are
ransacked for the vestiges of this surprising talent, when
it was first struggling into existence, and trying its
wing. So, with all others. Be he painter, poet,
auctioneer
when
a man, if he be distinguished as either,
there will be enough to remember that he was so, in his
boyhood.
Another fact.A parent is fond of musickhe
naturally
desires to have his child fond of it, too. The child
squallsmuch as other children squallbut the father
finds a particular expression, tone, or meaning in it.
The babe grows older; and the gamut is put into its
little
handsevery sound is watched, commented on,
encouraged
or reproachedhe hears nothing praised, but
musicknothing spoken of, but musicians. It is the
standard and touchstone of merit and virtue, for all men.
The child learns to ask, when he sees a strangernot,
whether he be wise or goodbut, on what instrument
he plays?not, whether he have a good heartbut,
whether
he have a good ear?not whether he talk wellbut,
whether he sing well?and to regard an affirmative, as
sufficient
to authorize any intimacya negative, as a
brand of vulgarity and insensibility. What wonder, if
the child become a musician, too?and what wonder
that people say, that a gift for musick runs in
this
family
;
and some other gift, in that? What nonsense! The
child is named, perhaps, after some musician or painter.
What wonder if it be taught to revere and imitate its
namesake?
I certainly have wandered, wide and far, dear
Stafford
;
but I am determined not to leave the subject now,
until it is exhausted.
One little anecdote, I would not omit, however, while
speaking of Mr. Alston. He is an amiable man, of
indefatigable
labour; and a fine genius, rather than a bold
one. He is chaste and fine, but timid. This may be
seen as well in his poetry, as in his painting. There is
an artificial heat in both. He wants passion; and even
true greatness;for there is too little evil in his heart
to help him in the generation of Greatnessa spirit that
is, always, of a troubled countenance, and appalling
expression, even in her repose. Yet, like all other men,
Mr. Alston is most anxious to appear what he is not.
He would be thought a genius, and nothing but a genius;
a creature that can people the blank canvass with a
burning vision, even while the smoke is passing before
him, and he can see nothing but the bright eyes and
loose hair thereof;for this purpose, he will toil all
night long, in secrecy and loneliness;and then, lie abed
all day; or, till dinner time, with an affectation of
carelessness
and indolence, that is very amusing. He wishes
it to be thought, that the labour, which is apparent in
every touch of the pencil, is the rapid handling of one,
agitated and thrilling with his subject!
You have heard of Mr. Peale; and you asked me, some
time ago, particularly, about his
Court of Death
, and
if he were not once in London, with the Mammoth. I am
now at leisure to answer you. I have enquired, and
found that he is the same man, who was in London; and
the reason of his going, is so creditable to his character,
as an artist, that you ought to know it.
Mr. Peale is of a family, who are all addicted to
painting
,
from their cradles. In the honest enthusiasm of
their hearts, they have been, for a long time, in the
habit
of naming their children, male and female, after
certain
eminent painters. Thus, this Mr. Peale, is named
Rembrandt; and, when in Paris, was called the
American
Rembrandt, though his style has nothing of the
sublime
vulgarity, or depth of Rembrandt; and he has
brothers
named Titian, Rubens, Raphael,
[9]
[9]
RAPHAEL PEALEadmirable still-life painter.
Ed.
Linnaeus, and
Franklin; and sundry relations, with equally significant
and unlucky names. It is a pity; for it almost always
forces the mind to institute some comparisonand the
result is usually discouraging.
This gentleman, it appears, was a portrait painter;
and, at a very early age, executed some portraits of
singular
merit. At length, after being married, and
having
some children, he determined to go abroad, and
study
the art, in its birth-place and homeunder the skies of
Europe. He returned, discouraged and dismayed; and
had almost resolved to abandon it, forever, and turn his
attention to agriculture. But the spirit that God had
kindled within him, was not to be so soon extinguished;
nor ever, but by the hand that had kindled it. His
family
had augmentedit was no light matter to venture
abroad, and leave themand to carry them with him,
was perilous in the extreme. What would they do,
helpless
and alone, in a land of strangers, were he to be
taken
from them? Yet, disheartening as the thought was,
it did not intimidate him. The unappeasable spirit
would not be quieted within him;he was haunted, day
and night, by the magnificent spectres of genius. He
went, again, with his whole family;he painted a
picture
,
and exhibited it to the French people; and he was
warmly encouraged. The darkness vanishedthe sun
shone out upon himthe mystery and wonder of the
art were laid open before him. He felt a new feeling
one of inconceivable determination and strength, arising
within him. David and Gerard came to see himsome
senators sat to him. He studied the face of Napoleon;
and obtained a better likeness, as David, himself,
acknowledged
,
of the lower part, than had ever been
painted
of him. He returned to Philadelphia; and, to
convince
the people that he had learnt something abroad,
he painted Napoleon on horsebacka distinct, single,
and vigorous picture, with a sublimity in the
countenance
of Napoleon, that I never saw excelledit is
absolutely
articulate and preternatural. It is the greatest
of his workmanship. He thenfor the Philadelphians
were still in doubt; and some said that he had borrowed
the horse, and the rider, too, from David's
Napoleon
passing the Alps
a picture like this in no particular
whatevera daring and tumultuous affairwhere a
heavy banner is breaking, like a thunder-cloud, over
the head of Napoleon:He then copied Mr. West's Lear.
It was a pity. Yet he made a better picture than the
original; tempering its exaggeration, and qualifying its
perverseness;but it was only a
copy
. The original is
now destroyed, I believe. Still there was nobody to cry,
God speed! to him, even in his native city.
Stafford, why is this?Is it the nature of man to
overlook
whatever is near and familiar to himto court
whatever is rare, and of difficult attainment? Why are
strangers met, as they are, with incense and wine, while
our own children are languishing?Yet, so it isa new
face, like a new planet, is apt to make us forget the old
ones. Thus, Mr. Alston, who is from the south, goes
to the north, for sustenance; and Mr. Morse, who was born
at the north, goes to the south. Thus, too, if girls want
to be married, they must go, no matter how amiable and
excellent they are, where they are
not
known;where
people are not familiar with their loveliness. How
many
a young man, unknown and unhonoured at home, is
found, steadily and proudly, among the great, when he is
abroad, and dependent only upon his own merit.
Excuse
vol. ii. M
the digression, dear Staffordthere was an
indignant
feeling at my heart, and I thought it safest to give
it vent, when I reflected on the miserably reluctant
spirit
,
with which we award to them that we have known,
the encouragement of genius. Why is it?Are we
unwilling
to be beaten in the race, by them that learnt
their alphabets out of the same book with ourselves;
trundled hoops; and flew kites, just exactly as we did?
Yesit is.If we be beaten by strangers; eclipsed by
the unknown, we conceal our mortification, under the
pretence that,
they
were born with some peculiar faculty,
which we wanted. But, we cannot lull our shame with
this unction, when we have
known
our conquerors, from
the cradle; and know that they have beaten us, not by any
inherent power, peculiar to themselves, but by their
industry
,
and perseverence. This, I believe, is the secret.
But, to return.
The next picture that Mr. Peale painted, was the
Roman
Daughter
; or, as Murphy calls it, in his tragedy,
the
Grecian Daughter
. No subject is more common;
but, it was never painted so well.A woman, full of
tenderness, in the deep breathing of the heart, is
nourishing
her own father, with her own beauty. The hand
of the old man is wrongit is badly placed, isolated
and produces a bad effect; but I know of no other fault
in the picture. When it appeared, a gentleman in
Philadelphia
,
who had travelled, and sure he ought to
knowpronounced it a copyMr. Peale waited on
him, in company with a friend; and asked him where he
had seen the original. The gentleman found some
difficulty
;
though he was exceedingly positive, that he
had
seen it, somewherein telling where: and, at last, named
the collection of Mr. Gerardof Paris.
Of Mr. Gerard!
said Mr. Pealein astonishment.
He was the mildest man in the world; and remarkable,
for his politeness, good temper and self-possession; but,
that was quite too much, for either, at the moment. He
entreated to know the roomand the stranger, finding
that Mr. Peale knew more about Mr. Gerard, than
he
didfinally abandoned his position, though reluctantly,
and qualified his charge, so as to make it stand thus:
that he had seen
something, somewhere, somewhat
like
it.
But, the evil had gone abroad. The picture was
warmly spoken ofbut, forever, as a
copy
. Mr. Peale
came out, therefore, and offered it, in the publick news
papers, to anybody, who would establish the fact, that it
was a
copy
. After that, he made a copy, which, I am told,
is altogether better than the orginal.
Next, he painted his
Dream of Love
; or, as he called
it at first, his
Jupiter and Io
. Originally, the face of
Jupiter was pressed to hersand no other part of
his
body could be seen, through the smoke and cloud that
enveloped
them. It had a bad effectthe Thunderer's
face
ought not to have been seen;and never, at such a
moment, in such an occupation. The God, even in his
repose, is not easily createdbut, when his forehead is
quaking, and the strong lustre of his eye, is a consuming
fire, before which, the heart melts, and the spirit faints,
it were madness to think of representing it. This head
was afterward blotted out; and a naked Cupid, painted
over the face of Io. The whole is now passionately,
but purely beautiful; the flesh lively, firm, and natural
with that soft and inviting elasticity, which makes the
lips thrill, in looking at it. In short, it is the best naked
woman that I ever sawand, by far, the most chaste. You
feel no impure emotionnothing but an innocent delight,
as you stand breathing over her, as if it were the picture
of your own sweet sisterasleep, in her timidity and
loveliness.
His next attempt was the
Ascent of Elijah
.It is
not yet finished; but the conception, which is after
Lutherberg
,
is imperial; the revolution of the cloudstheir
fiery crimson; and the vivid brightness of the brazen
chariot, are transcendent. I hope to see it finishedto
see the descending mantle, distinguished from the clouds
the whirlwind of fire and dust, more evidentthe
horses' heads, that stand opposite, like two rose leaves,
upon one stem, in some girl's drawing, correctedwhen
it will be the most vehement and poetical of his paintings.
To this, succeeded the
Court of Death
of which I
shall not attempt a description; for the papers that I have
sent you, are full of it. Yet, you ought to know
something
of the difficulty to be undergone in this country, by
an artist, who undertakes such a work. Here, he has no
academies; no collections; no other painters to consultif
exhausted, he must refresh himself as he can. He has
no academy figuresno people trained, to stand and sit
as he requiresno workers in plaster, if he want a hand
made permanently, for some particular study. And
what is yet worse, nobody, whom he can prevail upon to
sit. So that his men and women, are, nine times out of
ten, even in their anatomy, the literal creation of his own
brain.
This is one of the largest pictures in the world.The
figures, are full eight feet high, (I suppose)and are in
three groups; illuminated by torch-light, day light, and
reflected light.
The chief fault is, that, there is too much
abstractedness
in the conception of the painter. He is not satisfied
with Pestilence, Famine, and Conflagrationhe must
have something like thembut not the same. Thus,
instead
of Pestilence,he affects to embody the
apprehension
of Pestilence
. This is the very
metaphysicks
of
painting
.
Another serious fault is, that there is too little
foreground
to the canvass: the figures are too much in a line;
and, on the side where Death exerts most power, the least
effect is produced. On one side, his hand is raised, and
men are dying by disease. On the other, his hand is in
repose; and War, Pestilence, Famine and Conflagration
leap forth, like demons, commissioned on the spot, to lay
waste and destroy.
A part of the conception is magnificent. Mr. Peale
has uprisen, among the wrecks of the nursery, and dared
to array Death, in the calm, awful, unrelenting
attributes
of Philosophy. We see nothing of the raw head
and blood bones; nor the eyeless sockets, hour-glass and
scythe of
Christian
mythology. He disdains to follow
the vulgar notions of allegory.
But Death is the principal figure. And yet, it is not
readily perceived. The eye is first attracted by a corpse
a dead man, washed up, as it were, by the wind and
water, to the feet of Death. His countenance is
wonderful
but
the flesh is too warm; he is arrayed in dazzling
white---and you see too little of the presiding power.
There is not depth enough to the piece---and there
should have been clouds, and darkness, and fire, it may
be, about the picture of Death---and through the broken
roof, the blue lightnings, or, at least, the starry lustre
of a midnight sky should have streamed; but, instead of
this, instead of rocks, shattered and piled up, there is a
great curtain, heavy and grand, to be sure, hanging
down fromwe are left to imagine what.
Yet, the picture is a great one---the greatest that I
have ever seen---and a most extraordinary performance,
when we reflect on the discouragement that the artist had
experienced---his want of opportunity---and that it was
a first attempt at dramatizing on a large scale. It is
no easy matter to put many persons in agitation---even
to him, that has been accustomed to manage a few. The
difference is, that of training a large army and a small
one.
We have now come to Mr. Vanderlyn---and I must tell
you something about him, too. It will assist you in
remembering
him, and his worth. When Aaron Burr
was in his zenith, he happened to be travelling,
somewhere
in the western parts of New York; and stopping,
one day, at a tavern, he saw what he took to be, a line
engraving
,
of uncommon vigour. He spoke of it to the
landlord; and was not a little amazed, when the latter
told him that it was a drawing, made with a pen, by a
stupid boy of his; an apprentice to the blacksmith's trade,
of whom he feared that he should never be able to make
anything. Burr sent for the boy, and was so pleased
with him, that he tried to obtain him---but the master,
suspected some secret value, in his stupid apprentice,
and would not part with him, at last, on any terms.
Put a shirt into your pocket, said Col. Burr, in
passing
the boy; come to New York, when you can get a
vol. ii. M 2
chance, and ask for Aaron Burr---he will take care of
you.
Some time had passed, and Col. Burr had forgotten
the incident; when, one morning, in came a
strange-looking
boy, while he was sitting at breakfast; and, as
he approached, plucked out a bundle from his pocket,
and gave it to him. The colonel was not a little
amused
to find it a shirt. Here began the acquaintance; and
here, the eminence of Vanderlyn; and heaven so ordered
it, that, when colonel Burr, the Julius Csar of our
countrythe greatest evil spirit of his agewas in the
wane, Vanderlyn, who had just left Paris, warm with
favour, and rich with all that makes life comfortable,
encountered him, in his desolation; and, in his turn,
ministered to the necessities of his benefactor.
Such is the anecdote, as I have heard it; and such, I
believe, is the truth, in all the material facts.
The only two pictures of Vanderlyn, that I have seen,
are his
Marius
, sitting amid the Ruins of Carthage; and
his
Ariande
, deserted by Theseus. The former
obtained
a medal from the national academy, in France.
It is a stern, strange, natural picture; with a finish of
unexampled
perfection. The figure is larger than life,
sitting
like a giant, intruded upon by some vision of
conquest
and rebellion. There is nothing visionary, nothing
intellectual, about
Marius
. All is the barren and
bleak expression of the tyrant man, when his heart is
iron, and his nature hardened in blood. It is a great
picture
but
too elaborately finished.
His Ariadne is very beautiful; but you feel no
emotion
,
no trembling, when you approach her. You do
not feel that slight, tremulous quivering of the heart,
which you ought to feel, when trespassing upon the sleep
of even a
pictured
womanin her innocence, timidity,
and loveliness.
O, I had well nigh forgotten a picture that has just
been sent out to the Cathedral, in Baltimore, by Louis
of France. It is the Descent from the Cross; full of the
fine errour, and beautiful exaggeration of the French
school; yet, animate with a profound and daring spirit,
that startles and amazes you. There are eight or ten
figurestwo of which have no business, at all, in the
piece; and are put inone to fill up a blank in the
canvass
,
on the right, where he stands staring at you, like an
Indian statueand the other, to display the power of
the artist, in tinging the drapery with an undulating
ridge of rich velvet light. This latter is on the left;
and no human being could remain in the situation, in
which he is placed, for a single moment; nay, it would
be difficult for one to sit so, long; and there is nothing to
be seen to justify us in believing that he does sit. He
appears about to manifest his adoration. The artist is
fine in his feet; and, therefore, he has crowded the whole
picture with feet. A red outline, he has discovered, at
some time, to have the effect of illumination upon deep
colouring; and, therefore he has lined the very lips and
eyes; the tees and fingers, of all, or most of the figures,
with a red outline. The sheet, too, upon which the
Saviour
is lying, is not linenno, nor woollenbut wet
paper;and was, evidently, copied from wet paper, or
badly imagined; for it is saturate and heavy, with water,
in almost every fold. The artist, too, is fond of shadow;
the dark, clayey-coloured shadow, too, of death and
terrour; and, therefore, has he been lavish of it, to such
an extent as to appal the imagination. He is fond of
brightening his drapery; and his purple is transparent
and liquid, like flowing claret; unnaturally bright and
vivid. These are all the faults; and they are rather the
faults of the French school, than of the artist.
He
is
truly a sublime and original genius. The anatomy of
the Saviour, who is about nine feet long, is wonderfully
finethe countenance greatand that of his mother,
terrible
.
The evening sky is preternaturally lighted; and
the rough cross stands up against it, with a bold and
decided
effect, with a sheet floating from the top, as out of
the sky. To it, clings a woman, half frantick in her
grief and terrour, with her black drapery flying in the
windand resembling a shattered and torn banner,
against a blazing sky. By her side, is a beautiful
creature
a
woman, turbaned and queen-likestanding, as
if
death
-struck, at the instant that you look upon her.
Her eyes!by heaven, they have not yet ceased to move!
Look upon themthe lustre gushes out; and the delusion
is so wonderful, that, after gazing upon the face for a
moment, in a certain point of view, about five or six
yards from it, it no longer appears cadaverous and
unnatural
,
in its unearthly hue; but, like some beautiful
creature, at her worship, over whose head the skies
have just passed away, while the tears are loading her
uplifted lashes. It is the most wonderful head, except
one, that ever I saw in my lifewonderful for its
simplicity
,
beautyand yet more wonderful for its effect.
But, look at the drapery upon her breastwhat keeps
that purple mantle there?the wind? Nofor the wind
blows in another direction;nay, the wind is faint, as
you may perceive by her turban, which is of a lighter
material. Is it her action? Nofor her action would
throw it off. Yet it clings to her bosom, (which is too
broad,) as if kept there by a strong wind. Observe her
handsthey are perfect.
Another beautiful effect is producedperhaps without
intention. We see, from the very colour of the sky,
beyond
the ground, that all these figures are on a hill.
How this is apparent, it would be difficult to tellyet,
so it is. Perhaps it is, that there is, always, a peculiar
colour near the horizon; but, however that may be
excuse
me for a momentwe have every day experience,
that there are ideas existing in our minds, without our
consciousness of them;nay, that even when we are
made conscious of them, ideas that we have no language
to express, notwithstanding the doctrine that men think
in wordsand that they can have no idea, without a
correspondent word to express it.
Thus we are shown a profilea mere outline, and we
immediately recal the original. But how?
that
we
cannot tell. We look into a camera obscura; we see
shadows walking about; yet every one, we are able to
recognise, with certainty, afar off.
How
, we cannot tell.
Nay, to come nearer home. Can any of us tell
how
he
distinguishes the gait, voice, carriage, or tread, of any
particular person, amid a thousand. He can do it. We
see that. Yet, he has no idea
how
he does it; or, if he
have, he has no words to express it in; for, he may be
able to perceive the difference, without being able to
describe
it; or, to make another conceive of it, though he
should talk till dooms-day. Nay, how know we the
hand-writing of our friends?and how should we be
able to explain to another, who had never seen writing,
wherein the secret lay. Again, there is a certain air of
reality about the truth; and of constraint and
awkwardness
about what is counterfeit; and there are men, who
can tell you, at a glance, whether a signature be genuine
or not,
although they never saw any thing like it, before
.
This is incredible, and they could never make it
intelligible
to us. They
feel
the differencethey judge by it
they trust to it; but they cannot define it. Yet the
incredulous
,
no matter who they are, have always some
experience of their own, if they would but reflect, to
confirm
the fact. Have they never been able to tell, at
once, a manner that was affected?to point out what
was natural, and what was not, even in the voice, and
look, and manner of sitting, in a person whom they had
never seen before? Nay, have not all of us, at some
time, detected an impostor, a pretender, whom we had
encountered for the first time?solely by that
indefinable
,
strange, but convincing manner, which will betray
the counterfeit. Is this instinct? I know not. But
I know, to return for a single moment to the subject, that
we are often struck with things upon the stage, in books,
or paintings, unexpectedly naturalyet uncommonat
which we all wonderasking ourselves why it has never
been seen beforeand astonished that we should ever
have observed it sufficiently to see the resemblance. So
it isthe minds of all, the most careless and inattentive,
are stored with resemblances; and they awake, whenever
they feel the thrill of affinity; leaving people surprised
at their own memory and observation, and delighted at,
they know not what. Something truly naturalthat
they thought overlooked by all the world. So here, we
are amazed at finding in ourselves, a secret
consciousness
of what is
natural
, in this part of the picture.
Yours
,

SPENCER RANDOLPH TO SARAH RAMSAY.
Boston
, .
You have not returned my letter, Miss Ramsay; you
have dared to read and retain it, notwithstanding my
presumption. I expected this, I confess; but still, so
much depended upon itso much, that you, yourself, are
ignorant of, that I trembled for you. I cannot explain
myself, in this letter; and, it is highly probable, that you
may never receive another;but be assured that your
nobleness and generosity on this occasion, the most
trying
of your life, have literally saved you from
destruction
.
You are amazed. You do not believe meyet,
as true is it, thou excellent and strong minded woman,
as that I have meditated evil against thee, and relented.
But what evil? Lady, I cannot tell thee; I may never
be able to tell thee; but my heart quakes at this moment,
and there is a scorching heat about itand a sensation,
as if all its blood were filtering through it, drop by drop,
when I reflect on what thou hast escaped. Farewell!
heaven bless you!heaven, in its mercy and compassion,
bless and sustain you,
dear
Miss Ramsay. Does it
offend
you? Are you not
dear
to me? Have you not been
so; and have you not
known it too
, for a long time? You
have; then why should you affect any resentment at
seeing
the word inadvertently written, which you have read,
again and again, in my eyes;and, whichpardon me,
dear woman,which I have seen, legible engraved, in
the very apple of yours. Farewellyet, before we part,
as a memento of my sincerity and affection for you, I
pray you to listen to my admonition; and let it sink into
your heart. You are imprudenthaughtyand too
independent
.
Had you been less soI should never have
succeeded as I have, with you. It was on your excess of
these qualities, strangely disguised, to be sure, but not
so completely, but that my eye detected them, in our
first conversation, that I grounded my hope. Do you
know, what that hope was?
it was to destroy you
. Do
you smile? Remember how far I have gonehow
completely
you have been in my powerand then tell me,
proud woman, what saved you? Was it your own
strength? Nowas it that I had no opportunity, or did
I want power? Ask yourselfremember where we have
been, and
how;
alone, hour after hour; and then attribute
your safety to its true causemy forbearance. You once
desired to know who I was. I told youbut you were
not satisfied. I saw it; I saw by the colour of your eyes,
and the heaving of your bosom, that you were not; but
you dared not risk another question. It is now time
that I should tell youandbut no, Miss Ramsay,
that may not be at present. At some future hour,
perhaps
,
when we least expect it, you shall know the truth.
In the mean time, remember my words. Be more
guarded
in future;stifle the tenderness that you feel for me;
and pardon me, I beseech you, for the evil that I have
meditated against you; and the evil that I have done you,
in awaking your great heart, not to disquiet it forever, but
to prevent it, from ever sleeping again, in consideration
of my forbearance and sincerity.
Are you offended? You are. Do you believe that
you have been in such danger? You do not. Yet, II
who know woman, and know how to assail her, under
every temper and similitude, I can assure you, that you
have been so completely in my power, though
you
know it
not, that I could have destroyed you, utterly, if I would.
Reflect for yourself. Has not the time been, when, no
human being could have persuaded you that the hour
would come, when you could sit by any man, as you have
set by me?when you could feel your heart swell to
bursting, if he laid his hand upon yoursand when
but no matter. What you have experienced, will be a
lesson; a bitter one, I confess, but one that you will never
forget. Can you forgive me, Sarah? Nofor a while,
you cannotwill not; but, one day or other, you
will.
I am sure of it
.
You need not return this letter. I shall never receive
it, if you do; for, to-morrow I am going to New-York
on business; and I know not how much further, nor how
soon, I may return.
You are fond of poetry, I believeI enclose you a
piece written by a Mr. Molton, sometime ago. By the
way, that man, of whom I once heard you speak,
in a manner that disturbed me exceedingly, was named
Molton, was it not? Do you know his first name? Was
it Edward? If it was, I anticipate your pleasure in
receiving
the hymn, on the opposite page; for that was
written by a man named Edward Molton, some time
ago. I have heard a good deal of him here; and not a
little that would have alarmed me once, although I
remember
that your eyes flashed fire, when you spoke of
him; and your lip writhed with bitterness and scorn
and hatredand
terrour
too, I thought. How was it
Miss Ramsay?and who was
he?
I ask you, somewhat
confidently; not because I look for any answer; but,
merely
to show you that I have read your heart, even in its
concealment. Have you not loved Molton? You have
I am sure of it. He lives at the southat New-York
perhaps?or at Philadelphia? If so, I shall probably
meet with him; and, if there be such a man upon this
earth, it shall be my business to become acquainted with
himthough you and I, Miss Ramsay, should never
meet again. They tell a story here of himto this
effect
that
he stole upon the innocent heart of a lovely
young creature here, who became in time, passionately
fond of him. They say that she was a woman of
extraordinary
geniusthat her talents were of the highest order,
that she was timid, gentle; and yet, so full of heroick
principle, thatgracious God!can there be such a
woman upon this earth!when he grew weary of her, he
had only to acknowledge some unworthiness of his past
lifesome dark secret of his early daysand, much as
she loved himthough her heart-strings were
interwoven
with histhough she felt, as if the same blood
circulated in the veins of bothand their vessels and
arteries
,
intertwined and communicated with each other---
yet---yet!---she tore them all away at once---ruptured
them alland lay down, alone, smiling in her tears, and
bled to death. Is it true, Sarah? Have you ever heard
of it? But let me give you the poetry, of
this
Mr.
Molton
.
What think you of it? I am told that he wrote a
good deal, in his early days; and then, deliberately
abandoned
it; and that this, with one or two other little pieces
that I have, were the last of his productions. But can
this be the same man? Would
your
Molton have
written
a hymn? He
might;
for this one, it is said, had
little
of what the world calls religion, in him; and cared
more for poetry than doctrine, on such occasions.
Perhaps
he was like him, who said
Je crois de la religion
tout ceque j'en puis comprendre
et respect le reste, sans
le rejetter
.
Hymn for the Lord's Supper.
Crucifixion.
His
hour had come!and darkness rolled,
At onceo'er all the unclouded skies!
Temples were rentand dead men told
Their secrets and their mysteries!
His hour had come!the hour of death,
And lo! the man of sorrow bow'd
In meekness down;gave up his breath,
And blessed the red, blaspheming crowd!
His hour had come!and forth, there strode
Ten thousand clouded Cherubim
And hung beneath their blue abode,
On countless wings, to welcome him!
Archangels rode the wind!and through
You vault, that rolls away in air,
That sky of everlasting blue,
They bore the bleeding spirit, where,
Upon his judgment seat, with crown
Of glittering thorn, he sits, to bless
The tears of all, that, kneeling down
Weep at this hour of tenderness.

Once more, Sarah, farewell!remember me, as one
that hath repented of the wrong done to you---and atoned
for it, to the utmost of his power; and ready to atone for
it, with his blood.
SPENCER RANDOLPH.
SARAH TO JULIET.
I am ill, dear Juliet, quite ill, and have been so, for
several days, or I should have written to you before. I
thank you for your cruel letter. It had the effect of
alarming me into a sense of my danger; and I know not
what else might, so deep and wonderful was my
infatuation
was
, do I say? It
is
even to this hour, it
is
although I am now fully awake, to the danger that I have
escapedand to the character of the man; and to his
design
. Ask me not how I have learnt this. I cannot
yet bring myself to tell thee. I can only say, dear Juliet,
that,ah, I cannot speak it, for shame and sorrow
no matterno matter, Juliet--Randolph
might
have been
dear to me, in time. But that time is past. We shall
never meet again, except by some accident, which is not
likely to happen. He is a bad man, I fear;or, at least
that he
has been
, I have no doubt. But do not alarm
yourself about him more.I have been imprudentI
feel that I have. I feel my own weakness. It has
taught me compassion for the weakness of others. And
I do believe, Juliet, that I shall never speak, scornfully,
of any human being againof any woman, I mean;for
I now begin to understand something of that
tremendous
spell, with which the destroyer approaches them.
I awake and wonder at myself. It seems impossible
that what I have experienced, hazarded, felt, is not a
dream?I ask myself, again and again, if my nature be
alteredif I be the same woman that I was?And I
cannot
yet even understand the power, or the means, by which
the alteration has been affected. Have I been asleep, all
my life, asleep upon a precipice?Have I been
deceived
so long, and so utterly, in the knowledge of myself?
Thoughts that I should have derided and mocked at once,
are now the perpetual residents of my bosom.Dreams
at which, I should have wept onceare common to me,
now, night after night; and feelings, to which, I have
been a stranger all my life; feelings, which I could not
even understand in otherstrances that werethat
are
a destroying fire to me. Nay, the deportment and
accent
of endearment and passion, which, to see another
exhibit once, was enough to cover my forehead with
blushesand, make me faint at the heart, with
compassion
and shameall these things have been familiar to
Sarah Ramsay.
O Juliet, I cannot proceed. Your letter is before me.
My hand shakes; and a quick feverish sensation, like the
breath of serpents is constantly passing over my lips.
Yet, I cannot withhold my counsel and prayer for
thee
. I
think of thy situation, continually, dear. O do not, dear
Juliet, do not despond. The peril is chiefly imaginary,
depend upon it; and is abundantly aggravated by
apprehension
.
Be firm and confident, and
prepared
---use a
continual and gentle exercise; and, I am sure, that
heaven
will bless thee at last--thou wilt awake, dear, with the
mouth of thy babe clinging to thine---and thy husband---
Nay, Juliet---thy husband will be away; but a better than
he, a wiser, a surer help, even thy God, will be near to
thee. Farewell!---I will write again, as soon as my sore,
and mortified, and humbled heart, shall have the strength.
Farewell
,
SARAH RAMSAY.
P. S. The letter
was
dear to me; I confess it---and,
when I have recovered, I shall tell thee all. I do not
know who he is, or what, but I have a suspicion
which, I scarcely dare confess, even to myself,
because
,
admitting him to be, what my foolish heart would
imagine, his manner is still unaccountablestill
mysterious
and inexplicable. Farewell, once morefarewell.
S. R.
SARAH RAMSAY TO SPENCER RANDOLPH.
Randolph
, I pity you. Would that I could despise
youbut, though you deserve it, I cannot. You have
called me haughty. Yetyou have humbled me to the
dust.
I am
imprudent
, you say?In what?That I have
believed
in, and trusted to you, as an honourable man?
You are rightSarah Ramsay
has been
one of the
haughtiest of women; one of the most insensible. Was
this a reason for pursuing her, haunting her, breaking
down her spirit to
this
and desolating her hearttill
she has not even the strength, to lift up her hand in
supplicationnor enough even to resent the indignity of
your approach.
You have spoken plainly, very plainly, for a man to
speak to a woman;but I am not yet so utterly
abandoned
of heaven, as to believe you. No,
Randolph
No!
it is
not
true, that you could ever have destroyed me.---
It is not true, that you could have corrupted my heart.---
Wicked and treacherous as you were; insinuating and
persuasive--vehement and terrible, as you were, at times,
I should have resisted you, forever; and---the first hour
that uncovered the blackness of your nature to me---
would have been liberty to mine.---True, I should have
felt, what I now feel, an insupportable humiliation, at
your unworthiness.---I should have shed many bitter
tears; tears, that would have blistered the heart of any
honest man;---but they would have been shed, less in
sorrow for myself, than in shame for you.
Why have I written to you?---for two reasons---Nay,
for three. To convince you, that, humbled as I am, I
have yet the power to say, firmly,
farewell forever!
---
To remind you of that scene, where you had well nigh
betrayed your cruel purposewhen I awoke, for a
moment---as
if my limbs had been fettered by a serpent---
that
should convince you, that you never would have
prevailed---but---I
cannot reason, I scorn to reason with
you, on such a subject.-- A third motive, and the last,
is this.---I have not returned your letter.---Nay, I am
willing to own that I shall keep it, and that it will be
dear to me, while I live, as something that reminds me
of an escape, little less than miraculous;--but most of all,
to command you---nay, to entreat of you---never to
mention
Edward Molton to me again---and never, if by any
chance you should come in his way, never, if you have
any respect, or any compassion for me,
never
to mention
me to him.
Farewell
Randolph
, farewell; you little know the heart
which you have lost.
Farewell
,
S. R.
JOHN TO SARAH.
Philadelphia
Mr. Grenville has just sailed; and, not an hour has
past, since I parted with his wife, who had accompanied
him to the vessel. Her spirits are very low; and, with
reason, I think; for, if I may judge from the countenance
of a man, the shadow of death is upon his. Juliet will
never see him again.
But, prepare yourself for something that will make the
blood curdle about your heart. Sarah, I can scarce
believe
myself. Molton has been confined for some time;
I have seen him occasionally; but, it is only within a few
days that he has been out; and with whom, think you, he
was first seen? With Grenville! the husband of Juliet!---
The whole town are talking of it; and when I saw him,
this morning, shake Molton's hand, with all his heart
and soul; and then take the hands of his own wife, before
me, and place them in Molton's---and say, as he did,
with a deep, broken, agitated voice
my friend!---my
friend!---do thou support her and comfort her.To her God
and to thee, do I commit her!
when I saw
that
, Sarah,
what, think you, were my feelings? Juliet was unable
to support it---the tears filled her eyes---and she would
vol. ii. N 2
have fallen, had not Molton caught her; but, she
shuddered at his touch, and immediately turned to me---
heaven bless her! with her eyes still shut.
Molton smiled, haughtily; and, the next moment, we
were on our way home. Not a word was spoken---and
we left Juliet at the door. He turned, coldly, but
expressively
,
and bade her
farewell
. There was something in
his tone, or manner, that affected her; for I felt her hand
tremble, and she pressed mine, convulsively. She
looked
at him---her lips moved---she inclined her head---but,
she was unable to utter a word. His countenance fell;
and he promised to call on her, tomorrow, with
me
. This
was said, with a deliberate emphasis, as if to assure her,
that he should not visit her alone.
He then took a packet out of his bosom, directed to
her, in the hand writing of her husband---with a note to
this effect: This is only to be opened, on the occurrence
of one event---Mr. Molton will apprise my dear Juliet,
what that event is.
Poor Juliet trembled, from head to foot; and Molton
and I walked home to his house, where I was instantly
struck, with the altered and strange appearance of Helen.
I had not seen her, for a long time;---and now, there was
a wildness and brightness in her eyes; a heated brilliancy
in her cheeks, that alarmed me. I spoke to her,
earnestly
;
and her voiceit seemed to come from her very heart
thrilled through and through me. I took her hand; it
was wasted and hot; and, when I mentioned the name of
Juliet, she opened her large dark eyes, and then shut them
again, with such an expression of melancholy, that mine
filled on the spot. She did not appear to observe itand
her hand trembled in mine, for a moment, before she
withdrew
it.
Molton and I had then a long conversation together,
on a variety of matters; such as religion, character, &c.
&c.and I discovered a new trait in his, which I never
saw beforegreat vehemence in argumentand
surpassing
subtilty.
The conversation was long; and would have been
uninteresting
to any one, who did not participate in it; but,
nevertheless, as I have not written to you, for many a
day, and as I am upon my favourite theme, Edward
Molton
,
I will try to repeat some of his whimsical opinions,
as nearly in his own manner and words, as possible.
We spoke of pronunciation. He, it appears, is
amazingly
scrupulous on the subjectsayingIt matters
not how a word is pronounced, so that all agree to
pronounce
it alike. We have no perfect standard of
legitimate
words or pronunciation; but, we have a pretty good
one; and, to that, I am determined to conform. But all
their lexicographers are wrongSheridan, Walker, and
all. They give the sound of
tchu
, to the vowel
u
, in the
words furniture, virtue, premature, &c. They say that
a child cannot give the pure sound to the
u
. But, I ask,
why?the reason is very simple; a child is taught
to divide the words, thus: f-o-r,
for;
t-u-n-e,
tchune;
v-i-r,
vir
, t-u-e,
tchue;
and then, it is impossible, I
admit
,
for his delicate organs to pronounce the
u
, properly.
But divide the words, thus: virt-ue;fortu-ne;
pre-mat-ure;and there is no difficulty then.
We next spoke of logick. I charged him with
sophistry
.
He smiled. Nosaid heI am no
longer
a sophist. I have been one;but, I am ashamed of
the character.
Pray, said I, will you give some notion of the
changes that you have experienced in these matters? You
often speak of what you
have been;
by that, am I to
understand
that you are so, no longer.
Always
, he replied. I never so speak, unless I am
altered. I do not say
reformed
, because it is a doubt with
me, whether I am
reformed
. I but lay down one folly,
to take up another.
But where, and when, did you receive the first
impulse
to your strange and contradictory character?In
reasoning, for example.
I can tell you where, distinctly, on that very
point. When I was about I nineteen,happened to open
a volume of Rees's Cyclopedia. And I came upon this
proposition. I know not who was the author of itbut
it was a great man; and my brain took fire in the contact
and a tremendous creature was generated in the
smoke!I heard the flames roar like the Atlantickthe
noise, and shaking thereof, were like an earthquake.
You smilebutI do not know what I am saying, dear
Omarmy poor brainpardon me.
(He had been quite delirious, poor fellow, for nearly a
month)Well, the pain is over now. The proposition
was this:Men complain of God's severity:they
lay their hands upon his threatening and denunciation,
and complain that he is unmerciful. Mistaken creatures!
This very threatening is a proof of God's merciful and
compassionate disposition. That startled me. But
follow
him. He reasons like a giant. God does not
threaten, says he, that man may sin, and so, be
punished
:
Butthat he may
not
sin, and so escape.
Therefore
,
the
higher
the threatening runs, the
greater
is the
mercy of God.
I was angry. I understood nothing of logick,
continued
Molton. But, I did not know where to lay my
hand, in my anger. I revolved, again and again, the
proposition. I felt that it was unanswerable. And yet,
I felt that it was a fallacy. I threw by my book,I
neglected my business. I thought of nothing else
dreamt of nothing else; and, at last, the light broke upon
me. I tried the syllogism in my own way. It crumbled
at my touch.
But how? said Ihow was it?
By showing that it proved too much. For it might be
applied to a human lawgiver; and the laws of Draco
himself, could be defended by it. Naywhat penalty,
though it were bloodblood!for every transgression
alikewhat torturewhat mode of death, might not
thus be proved to be merciful; nay, to be merciful,
exactly
in proportion to its severity and terrour?
God threatens. If we
err
, he
will
inflict the penalty.
But we cannot live for a moment, without
erring
, in
thought or word or deed. And, therefore, the mercy of
God would be most conspicuous, should he threaten us
with everlasting perdition for the slightest of our errours:
If the proposition be
true
, it would be infinite mercy in
Jehovahshould he punish us, forever and ever, for not
living, as we
cannot
livewithout errour.
NoOmar. The doctrine is a fallacynay, worse,
it is blasphemy. The mercy of God is shown by his
proportioning the penalty to the offencethe
denunciation
,
as exactly as possible, to the errour;so that the
temptation may be just outweighed, and no more, by the
terrour of his displeasure, and the fear of offending one
that loves us.
YesOmar. And when the proposition is examined,
coming as it does, from one of the greatest theologians
of the age, it sinks to a level with this, which you have
heard, I dare say, many a time.
A cat has three tails
.
NayI do not wonder at your smile; yet it is as honest
and
as
fair, to the full, as the proposition that I have just
overthrown.
Prayhow is it proved? said Ifor I have never
heard it. Thus
No
cat has two tails.
A
cat has one
tail more than
no
cat has. Ergo.
A
cat has three tails!
I laughed heartilyand who, that had never heard it
before, would not have laughed; but not a muscle of his
face stirrednot a limb shook.
That
gave the first impulse to my character, said
he. I lay and wondered, in the deep midnight, at the
strange power of reasoning. I saw, and began to revere
it, for the first time, in contemplating that proposition.
I devoted myself to the study; not as a science, for I
never looked into a book; and, to this hour, I know
nothing
of the logick of the schools; not in disputation, for
I never lifted my club, I never extended my shield, till
I had made myself master of both, in my own way.
I came abroad then; and gave battle to all that I knew.
I threw down my gauntlet, in the face of heaven and earth
and spoiled many a strong man of his harness, before
I was weary of strife. I delighted in parodox. I
wrapped
myself up in sophistry;and, if I went among men,
it was with an encompassing darkness about me, that
chilled and awed them, while it kept my faculties in
everlasting
shadow. I could not go beyond it. I began to
doubt of every thing,of every thing, but a God. But
it was not to be so, forever. I awokeI rent the cloud
that hung over meare you superstitious?
No!
said Isomewhat startledno!
At my birth, sir, and for a week afterward, there
was a cloud, scarcely larger than the wings of a great
bird, which descended from the mountain, and hung over
my father's dwelling, and rained upon it, night and day
so near to it, that you could have fired through it, with
a rifle bulletand there it staid. All the rest of
heaven
was bright. That same cloud hath hung over my
mind, at times; and rained its reluctant, cold dews, upon
my heart, from that hour to this.
His manner was very solemn and composed. I was
troubled at it; but, whatever he had been, I am sure that,
then
he was in his senses. I next led the conversation
to the Bible, of which I had heard that he had spoken
irreverently
.
I was willing to know the truth. I asked
him the question at once.
Yessaid I,I have so spoken of the Bible. I am
sorry for it. I wish that I had been better assured of
its value. I had reasoned thus of it, and its doctrines.
Either the Bible is necessary, or it is not. If it be not
necessary, let us not disquiet ourselves about it. If it
bethen is God unjust, for millions of millions have
perished, are perishing, and will perish, without ever
hearing of it. But God cannot be unjust, and therefore
the Bible is
not
necessary. Nay, Omar, I went further.
In the darkness and blindness of my nature, I dared to
ask where lay the proofs of christianity. I had read
Paley's Evidences. I had read and pitied Soame
Jennyngs
.
Is not our Maker infinitely powerful? Infinitely
wise? said I. Will not infinite wisdom and power
always
act by the simplest means?And is it the simplest
operation, for the Diety to put innumerable
engines
at work, and suffer that work to depend upon ten
thousand contingenciesto effect the spreading of the
gospel among all the nations of the earth?when, by a
single word, allall!from the creation of the world
to the end thereof, would have become illuminated and
converted.
These were the thoughts of my proud and
presumptuous
nature, Omar; and this hour I should be down,
quaking and shivering in agony, and remorse, for
having
had such thoughts, did I not feel that I was more to
be pitied than blamed. I was mistaken, but honest.
And God, himself, will have compassion on the honest
and mistaken.
Soon after this, I met with Butler's Analogy.
There
was a man, whom I could listen to, with pride. He
reasoned
he
took nothing for grantedhe went, with a
severe and majestick simplicity, into the labaratory of
the universe; into the very presence chamber of Jehovah;
and there sat and expounded the tremendous mystery,
which had darkened my understanding.
Is God partial? said he, when he grants to one,
what he denies to another? Yet where do you see two
people, two nationsnay, two individuals, enjoying
precisely
the same advantages? One lives in a kinder
climate
a
more fruitful soilis better fashionedmore
highly gifted, intellectually and physically, than another.
It cannot be denied that this is so. Then, is it
consistent
with his administration, to give the Bible to one, and
deny it to another? Is it not of a piece with all his
Providence
?
Again---God, by a word, could have peopled the world
at once; covered it with a forest. But he chose a
simpler
process. He created one pairhe taught them to
increase and multiply; he bade the forest to come
gradually
out of the earth.Nay, is not all that he does, in the
same harmonious measure, like one that pours out time,
from the inexhaustible fountain of Eternity; and teaches
his phenomena to appear and disappear, day after day,
year after year, and century after century, with the
same indifference.
A God, said I, interrupting him.
Who sees with equal eye, as God of
all
,
A hero perish, or a sparrow fall
Atoms and systems into ruin horl'd,
And now a bubble burst, and now a world.
He fixed his eyes sternly upon me, as I repeated these
lines. Pshaw!I am ashamed to hear you quote that
said he. Is it true?No!Did you ever reflect on it?
Systems and atomsbubbles and worlds, of the same
value to God?No!It is little better than blasphemy,
hardly to be forgiven in a poet. What!are we no
higher in the scale of being, than the beasts that perish?
and is it a matter of equal indifference to our Maker, that
one immortal soul is extinguished, an accountable spirit
set free, in the whirl-wind of warfor it is
there
, that
heroes
falland that a sparrow hath perished. It
were an argument for an Atheist. Never repeat it
again, dear Omar, I intreat you. Here, ended our
conversation
,
for that time. Good nightdear Sarah.
Yours, truly
JOHN.
STAFFORD TO MOLTON.
I thank you, my excellent friend, for your kind letter,
of the , and I hasten to reply to it, as briefly as
possible. The vessesel is just about to sail, I find; and
I must send you one word of acknowledgment, and
thankfulness by herthough it be
but
one word; and
answer
you, when I have a little better opportunity. I
should have written to you, many times before, but I have
been expecting to see you; and, until I received this
letler
,
I knew not where to address a line.
You have gone, with your usual boldness, into the
character of Byron, and the Unknown; but, I cannot
agree with you, throughout; nor, would you wish me to.
I know your temper too well, to believe that. I think
your manner too, is too dictator-like; too arrogant and
unqualified. But, I am anxious to hear more from you,
on the subject; and, particularly, upon the character of
your countrymen, and your great men, if you have any;
for, I have a serious design to pay you a visit, in the
spring. Who are your writers?what are they?You
have not mentioned all. In this country, we only
know a
few
of themsuch as the writers of the
Federalist
some
of your Reviewersand Mr. Trumbull, the
poet. Have you any dramatists? architects? sculptors?
musicians? poets? novelists? historians? orators?
statesmen
?
tragedians? painters?Let me know something
more about them; and don't forget to give me some
general
notion of the state of society, politicks, religionO,
I beg you to be particular, respecting that partfor, I
begin to attach myself, with emphasis, to theology.
The Editor of that paper therethe Galaxyseems to
be a hardy sort of a fellowbut why does he abuse my
stray countryman so bitterly?
Who is Mr Pinkney? What is he? A great man, or
not? I saw him, once, at St. James'sbut I never liked
him; and, when I read his official correspondence with
our cabinet, there was such an air of laboured
nothingness
;
something, so excessively polite, and round-about,
that I began to think humbly, indeed, of him. There is
a Mr. Wirt, too; haven't you some such a name? Wirt,
or Wart? Let me know something about him. They
are Lawyers, I believe---are they not? By the way, is
it possible, that a Lawyer can be an honest man? Is it
not the most abject and humiliating profession, where
the highest prerogatives of man, are set up for sale, to the
highest bidder? Nay, that reminds me of a remark of
yours; and, if I mistake not, about this very Mr. Pinkney;
yes, it was---I am sure of it. You said, that, you could
determine, at any time, the amount of the fee, which he
had received, by the quantity of sound that he emitted;--
that a scale might be graduated, upon which, without
knowing one word of the subject, you would be able to
tell, exactly, what quantity of calorick he would give
out, on any particular question. Was it he? I am
curious
to know.
Ah, there is another thing. You are always boasting
I mean you Americans, about the freedom of your
government! Is it any such wonderful discovery? I
think not. Aristotle, you know, has shown, in his
political
writings, that he was familiar with all the
doctrines
vol. ii. O
of representation; and many cities of Greece
practised
the same. Make me understand it. And, above all,
that
must not be forgotten. You used to speak in a way
that troubled and distressed me, respecting religion, the
errand of our Saviour, and his miracles. If you have
changed your opinionas I hope and pray that you have,
let me know. I shall love you, a thousand times better
for it. But, if you have not, let me beg of you to be
silent
.
Pass the matter over;let us not discuss it.
Yours

SPENCER RANDOLPH TO MISS RAMSAY.
New York
, .
If the deepest contrition and sorrow; if a determination,
which nothing but death can prevent me from carrying
into effect; a determination to repent, and be forgiven by
a woman, whom I have deeply wronged; if the
knowledge
of this can be any consolation to that woman;I
would have her know it. Sarahdear Sarahbelieve
me. I have wet the pillow with my tears. I am unable
to sleep; and I have arisen, at midnight, to tell thee that
my heart is breaking. To-morrow, I was to have
departed
for the south; but I dare not go
I dare not
.
There is a spirit standing in my way; the spirit of a
wronged and beloved one, and I dare not advance a step.
Here I shall abide, Sarah, even
here
, whatever be the
consequences, till I hear from thee, in reply. I do not
ask thy forgiveness yetI do not deserve it. But
appoint
me to any trialname the hour and the day, when,
after having passed through all that shall be required of
me, I may venture to approach thee again, in the hope
of forgiveness; and I shall not despair of deserving it.
Let not my prayer be in vain. It is for thy sake, Sarah,
for
thine
alone, at this moment, that I pray this; for I
tremble and faint, when I reflect upon the insupportable
humiliation, to which I have subjected thee. Can I be
forgiven?on any termsI care not what. Trust me
I have wronged thee, dear; but I am able and ready to
recompense thee.Gracious God!what do I say!no
Sarahno!fly me!avoid me!rend my letter in
pieces
,
and scatter it to the winds. There is a fatality that
pursues
me. I cannot, cannot give thee comfort. Where
am I? In truth I do not know. My birth has been
mysterious
my
dwelling, not among men. I know not
where I am, or whatbutnay, nay, Sarah, I cannot
break thy heart at onceI cannot tell the whole truth,
unpreparedlyit would kill thee. I can only say, that, in
seeking to ensnare theeI have enmeshed myself. I
never knew itI never suspected it; and, when I
abandoned
thee, in compassion and magnanimity, as I
thoughteven then, I was more in thy power, than thou
wast in mine.O, what blindness and infatuation. The
tyger, at the mercy of his prey. Thy letter awoke me,
Sarahso calmso affectionateso sorrowful. Oh
it went to my heart. Tearstearsthe first that I
have shed for many a weary day, fell, like rain, upon the
paper. I have never kneltnever, scarcely, in my life,
except to thank God for some favour, already received;
never in sorrow; never in shame; never in humility;
but, when I read thy letter, dearan irresistible
something
plucked me to the earth, and held me there. I was
choking; the hand of Godof the living God, was
upon me. I arose, labouring, blinded, and distressed,
as if a ligature were drawn about my naked heart, by the
hands of a giant;as if it had been pressed and pressed,
till there was no moisture left in it. I felt an alarming
heat in my brain. I arosea strange faintness and
darkness came over me, and I fell, with my arms across
upon the table. What saved me from death?Sarah, I
know not. For a moment, I was inconceivably
frightened
.
I had not the strength to call out for assistance;
and I verily believed that I should never arise again.
But I didafter a few moments, I was able to lift my
head. I looked at my fingersthe sweat had oozed out
of their ends, and stood upon the table in drops. My hair
was wringing wet; and the linen, about my throat and
bosom were; as if I had been taken out of the water.
Yet, I was soon upon my feet. Up I stood.I did not
kneelI would notand I reasoned with myself. Was
this the apoplexy?Nothere was no rushing of blood
in the brainI had not been disturbed by passion. But,
it might be so. Well then, thought Ilet it be so.
Two more such shocks, and I am no longer a burthen,
and a curse to them that love me. And why should I live
longerwhy wish to live.
And then, Sarah, even then, I would have written to
thee, and told thee of my contrition, but I was ashamed
to do it. I was
afraid
to do such a thing from fear. I
waited, therefore, tillto-night. I am well, now,
comparatively
welland, the refore, do I write to thee, and pray
thee to forgive me. Let me know it soonvery soon, for
I am weary of life.
S. RANDOLPH.
MISS RAMSAYIN REPLY.
I
do
forgive thee, unhappy man; I
do
, from the bottom
of my soul. Repent, and another will forgive thee;
another
,
whom thou hast more cruelly wronged, more
deliberately
scorned, than me. O, Randolph, RandolphI
could weep tears of blood for thee. NayI would that
I were near thee, even at this moment, sick and weary
as I am, to comfort thee, in thy desolation. Even to
this, am I reduced;the
haughty
and
presumptuous

thy feet with her tears; and wipe them with her hair

I charge thee!until thou hearest again from me.
It will be soon, very soon, if I have life left. I can
write no more, now. I am very faint; and thy terrible

S. RAMSAY.
JOHN TO SARAH.
Dear Sarah
,
I wrote you, merely to say, that, Frank has arrived
at Charleston; and, that, we may expect him in a few
weeks. He has succeeded. Your property is secure;
and all will probably go right. I can tell you
something
else that will please you. Molton has some
feeling
of humanity. He has never seen Juliet but once,
since Grenville's departure; and that was in my company.
His manner was impressive and mournful; but there
was no tenderness in it, though Juliet's eyes were
constantly
full. I have visited him two or three times; and
the result of my observation is, that he ought to be one
of the happiest men in the world. His wife is, without
any exception, the most wonderful woman that I ever
knewwhether for beauty, tenderness or talent. Do
not be jealous, SarahI know what I sayShe is
the most
wonderful
and perhaps the most beautiful
but not the most holy and dear, nor the most lovely.
There is too much majesty and brightness in her
deportment
;---too
much insupportable wildness in her lamping
eyes;---too much of passion, voluptuousness, and
intoxication
,
and delirium about her. She is a good deal
changed of late.I should think her mind continually
occupied with some profound and awful meditation.
She is absent---and her long, beautiful lashes are often
wet and drooping with moisture, ere she appears to know
it; and then she lifts up her headshakes back the
abundant
richness of her tressesand her eyes shoot fire
again. I have set by her, and watched the changes of
her countenance---as she leaned forward, and gazed
upon
Molton, holding his hands to her heart, while he slept,
vol. ii. O 2
as a mother would watch the troubled sleep of her babe,
trembling and breathless---
till I have thought her
the
most affectionate and attractive of human beings. And
when I last saw her---there was a sudden movement
of her countenance, which terrified me, as Molton, in
stooping for a book that had fallen---stopped for a
moment
,
as if a serpent had seized upon his vitals. She
turned deadly pale---and pressed her lips to his hand
with such distracting tenderness, that it startled me. What
did she fear?---What was there, in a slight pain of the side,
to convulse her, from head to foot, as that did? I know
not---but her manner then, and her wild delirious
rapture
;
(for she stood up like something heavenly, in a trance
of gratitude, when he slowly lifted himself up, and
smiled
,
and kissed her forehead,) set my heart a throbbing
very strangely. I cannot understand these things---
They are not natural. They are more like the love that
we
read
of, than that which we see.---
See
---what love,
what, that ever resembled love?
have I ever seen.
Ever yours, dear Sarah
,
JOHN OMAR.
EDWARD MOLTON TO GEORGE STAFFORD.
You have taken my breath away, dear Stafford! what
a storm of interrogatories! would you carry me, and all
my faculties, at once, by a
coup de main?
However, let
me answer you,
briefly
, if I can, as many, as I can.
And first, I thank you, heartily for
your
letter. Short
as it is, it was very welcome to me; and I am already
looking with impatience for another. Several of mine
are on the way; and one, in particular, of four or five
sheets, in which you will find all your queries about
painting anticipated.
And first for Byron. If I remember right, I spoke to
you only of his
Don Juan
. You cannot agree with me.
I am sorry for it, for I feel convinced that I am right
right, I mean, in my opinion, although I may have failed
in expressing it. Once more, therefore, let me place my
thought before you, respecting him; and, particularly,
respecting his
Don Juan
; for, of that only, I spoke
before
;
and I should like to bring you over to my doctrine.
Byron is a compound, you know, of contrarieties.
The elements of which he is fashioned, are forever at
war. The very thoughts of his heart hold no affinity
with each other. They can never assimilate, happen
what will. We might believe him derangedbut, if he
be, it is a moral derangement, not an intellectual one.
He has just dashed into the region of tragedy, not
with pinions of fire, but in a chariot, of old fashioned
Corinthian brass, that rumbles along, through the skies,
like the Lord Mayor's coach on a gala-dayover the
rough pavement of London. Yet is there the same surly,
dark, bitter and unpropitiating character, throughout
all that he has written, except in his Don Juan. But
that!O, the blood starts and thrills, when it is
named
,
as if, barefooted, one had trodden upon a nest of
matted flowersfull of coiled serpents. There is such
a wicked, wanton levity,such a flippant blasphemy,
and all that, in Don Juan.
Such at least, your reviewers, dear Stafford, declare
to be the sum and substance of the poem. And, with so
much distempered eloquence and beautiful invective, hath
it been assailed, that, when a plain matter-of-fact man,
in his sober senses, takes it up, he is amazed to find how
little there is of profligacy or irreligion in it.
But, the ball once struck, must be kept up, though it
fire the heavens. And to denounce, with all the thunder
and lightning of genius, the poem of Don Juan, has
become
a matter so fashionable of late, that it is really
somewhat ridiculous, when one looks at the real
importance
of the thing. It is allwind and fireocean and
tempestconfederating
To waft a feather, or to drown a fly.
It was a sort of prize question, like the death of
Napoleon
,
given out to the four corners of the earth, by
the sound of trumpet; a question upon which it seemed
impossible to be extravagant; and therefore, all the
ambitious
spirits of the age have been out; and the noise of
their contention hath been very terribleverydear
Stafford!
There was a young and passionate writer in
Blackwood's
Magazine, whose eloquence is so burning and
brilliant, that, touch what subject he will, the alloy and
earthiness drop away; and a beautiful vapour arises, by
a sort of intellectual alchymy, which blinds and dazzles
us to the operation, by its miraculous colouring:a
writer
,
who can be traced, like the serpent of a flower garden,
through all his involutions, by the changeable glitter and
fascination that follow him;or by the coloured vapour
that hovers over the spot, where he has hidden himself:
and it happened that he, in the mere wantonness of
power
,
like Rousseau, when he battled against civilization,
bethought himself of abusing
Byron
, under the name of
Don Juan
. He threw himself upon the poem, with much
the same spirit, and with much the same terrour and
splendour of aspect too, that we might look for, in a young
Leopard, who had leaped,
by mistake
, upon a creature
like himself.
But he acquitted himself nobly. It was impossible to
read the denunciation of Don Juan, without quailing.
If you had never read the poem
, you would have thought,
after reading the
criticism
, that, since the earth was
created
,
there never had been so perilous, wily, and beautiful a
devil, among its flowers and perfume. You would have
trembled, from head to foot; and, perhaps, have
proscribed
the poem, as something charged with pestilence and
death, to all that was tender, delicate or holy in religion,
affection, or morality. The game was well run, in your
country; and some of our staunchest huntsmen are out
upon the track, in America, at this moment. But it won't
do. Their intentions are good, I have no doubtbut
they have acted unadvisedly. The harmless pleasantry;
the licentiousness and imbecility of Don Juan, have been
made too terrible by it. The poem has become so
notorious
and popular, thatI am half inclined to suspect a
conspiracy between the reviewers and the publishers, and
perhaps Lord Byron himself;for nothing could be more
profitable
than such abuse.
The poem has been abundantly over-rated. There are
parts in it, which Byron says, are so
very fine
that he
does not pretend to understand them, himself. The
greater part is the mere ribaldry of conversation. Yet
it has, altogether, been denounced, as the most dangerous,
wonderful, and profligate poetry that was ever written.
Ridiculous!Its
power
does not often appear; but, when
it does, there is a colour and a light about it, that
cannot
be forgotten. Its
beauty
too, is, now and then,
bewitching
,
simple and sweet. Take this example
Haidee
,
Juan's loved one, dies, broken heartedand is
buried
with
vitalitythe vitality of love and passion, at
her heart. Ah, it is unparalleled, for that devout
tenderness
that
bleeding of the torn bosomover branch
and bough, fruit and blossomwhich all people must
feel.
She diedbut not alone; she held within,
A second principle of life, which might
Have dawned, a fair, and sinless child of sin;
But closed its little being without light,
And went down to the grave unborn, wherein
Blossom and bough lie, withered with one blight;
In vain the dews of heaven descend above
The bleeding flower and blasted fruit of love!
But these melancholy, tender and mournful touches
are not of frequent occurrence.
And as to its
dangerous
tendency; there has been too
much fuss made about
that
already. We read
Shakspeare
,
Cervantes, Fielding, Smollet, Gibbon and Hume,
and Rousseau. Why do we not rend and scatter their
leavesand reprobate
them
, as fiercely, for their brutal
licentiousness, passionate eloquence, or infidel scoffing?
For my part, I have no such apprehension concerning
the influence of Don Juan. By permitting it to be read;
or, at least, by not making any particular fuss about it,
you will permit it to die a natural death. Prohibit the
cup; and, though it were known to be drugged with
delirium
,
you excite a burning thirst, which will be slaked
at the peril of perdition. Would you prevent a child
from drinking wine? do not worry him, eternally, with
interdiction. If you do, you only excite a curiosity to
understand the reason of all your alarm; you only
provoke him to say that there must be, after all,
some secret pleasure, to counterbalance the nausea
that he feels, while his taste is unperverted; and,
therefore
,
he persists, even to intoxication, that he may know
the truth. So with Don Juan. By interdicting it
continually
,
you have made it familiar to the thought of
your women. But why interdict it at all? Are you afraid
of your daughters and wives? What! have you so little
confidence in the virtue and discretion of your dear ones!
Depend upon it, that the woman, who could be corrupted
by reading Don Juan, could never be prevented from
reading it; or from doing worse, on a fitting opportunity,
by any care of yours; and that she would not be worth
the trouble of your guardianship. I know women well,
much better it may be, than these very men, who affect
so to venerate them, that they dare not permit a taint of
impurity to approach them. I have a higher opinion
too, of their virtue. I am willing to expose themand
confident of their resistance. They are not. I, for my
part, have learnt that,
that
is not virtue, which has not
been tempted; and that many a fallen woman is more
purebecause she has withstood more temptation, than
many, who are yet upright.
NoIf the people who understand the matter, will let
the poison alone, its fiery and dissolving, and corrosive
properties will be forgotten. They will be neutralized,
by the air and dew of heaven. Let Don Juan alone
and my life on it, that it is forgotten in another twelve
month.
One word more of Byron, however, while I am
in the humour. This downfall is near, and he knows it.
Every thing that he has done of late, has been one
desperate
attempt, after another to regain, his old ascendency.
His defence of Pope is impertinent and ridiculous. His
war with Southey is contemptible. His speculations about
the unities are presmptious and insulting. We know
that he disdains them. What else he may do, in his
infatuation
,
it is impossible to predict; but, nothing that
he can do, will astonish me, though he should become a
wandering Arab; a paltry Gazetteer; or even a
clamourous
demagogue. All these last vehement aberrations of
his, are only the final struggles, of a dethroned
Archangel
,
whose magnificent wings have borne him, too high
above their natural element, into an atmosphere, too pure
for him to fly in; and a world, too confounding for his
contemplation. They that inhabit there, have struck
him to the heart. Already, is he reeling in his descent;
and the bright confusion that we see now and then, in
our glimpses of him, amid the darkness where he lost
himself, in his blind and wayward journeying, above the
stars, is but the convulsive discharges of a mind, that
God hath nearly extinguished; forced into uncommon
brightness, by violent and unexpected concussion, with
the invisible and inconceivable.
It is emphatically the
meteorology
of that man's mind,
which we are made to study; sun-shine and storm
hurricane
and lightningthe phenomena of a heart, made
up of all the elements that have no affinity to each other
all the materials of decay; and all the principles of
immortality
earth
and fire.
Weary of walking on the earth, and flying in the same
heaven with other men, he has sought to burrow in the
one, and to get above the other.
My belief is, that Byron's whole aim is, to be thought
more wicked than he is. The world have consented to
humour him. They have agreed to believe that he hath
a devil. Alas, they are mistaken. A devil, at heart,
would be firmer in purpose. Devils are less wavering.
And, spite of all opinion to the contrary, I maintain that
Byron is a much better man, husband, and father; and a
much
weaker
one, too, than the world believe. He has
none of that iron constancy of nature; that
impenetrability
of soul, which a great scoundrel must have. He
knows this; and, therefore, he affects to be a misanthrope;
a scoffer; and a tyrant. Pho---phoLord George
Gordon Byron would be a very pleasant sort of a fellow,
if he had not been born with a club foot. I am
altogether
in earnest. It is that, which has made him what
he is. A deformed man must be
better
than other men;
or he
must
become vindictive, testy, suspicious and
melancholy
.
He cannot enjoy a thousand pleasures, which
are common to them; and, for that very reason, he
persuades
himself that they are far more delightful than they
are. He cannot dance, or walk, or ride, or fenceor
appear in places of amusement, except as a sort of
qualified
spectacle. Ambition has no charms for himor,
at least, none but an evil ambition has. And why? Ask
yourself, my dear Stafford, what is the aim, the ultimate
and final aim of all ambition. Is it notreflect a
moment
,
before you reply;is it not the love of woman?
Can there be an exceptionwas there ever an exception
think youwhere the ambitious man was capable of
enjoying her love? Charles of Sweden, and Frederick
of Prussia are apt illustrations. How, then, is a
deformed
man to be ambitious? Not, surely, as other men
are; for, though he should be loved, he cannot but distrust
the sincerity of that love. To him, it will either be
feigned
,
or mistaken; he will call it appetite or infatuation.
He would not dare to be happy, lest he should perpetuate
his deformity. StaffordStaffordwere you a deformed
man, would you hazard the begetting of monsters? I
feel what I say; and I conscientiously believe that a
deformed
man must be radically a better man, and
constitutionally
a kinder man, if he be sociable and amiable to
any degree, than any tolerably well fashioned man.
What has been the affectation of Byron? Has it not
been, continually, as it always will be, with men of
perverted
power, and distempered bearts, to depreciate
whatever is unattainable to him? Are not all his women
what they ought not to be?and, is not this,
perfectly
reconcileable to my supposition?
But what will be his reputation, with posterity?
Which of his multitudinous works will survive? I do
believe that I can tell. His tragedies are contemptible.
His poems are fine mataphysical prosecompounded of
magnificent, but not splendid, and puerile thought. They
are never great, nor simple. But his
Cain; Manfred
;
and the
Ode to Napoleon
will outlive all else that he
has written. They are imprinted all over, with the
imperishable features of strength and beauty. They
will remain, till men shall seek to comprehend, as men
now rake among the pyramids, for the vestiges of an
ancient worldthe nature of that man's mind, which,
in our time, sought for immortality, where, to have
obtained
it, would have damned him; the disposition of a man
who sought to hide himself among the constellations of
heaven; and then fell, headlong, from his elevation
and was buried, after all, in only a more celestial kind
of
earth
, than other men are content to be buried in; but
an earth, nevertheless, that, to his notion, was
impregnant
with oil and odour, and gave out continual
exhalations
of light, and mystery or beauty:of a man, in short,
whose grave shall be a place of subterranean musick,
forever and ever.
Have we any great men? you ask. Alas, many.
They are plentiful as blackberries, and, about as
valuable
.
Every ten miles square has its Solon or
Lycurgus
;
its Cicero and Demosthenes. Every town is
fruitful
,
in the greatest men of the ageof men, who, had
they been born in Greece, or Rome, or Great Britain,
would have held the nations of the earth in thraldom.
So you might believe, if you would trust to our
Biographies
,
and political writings. And yet, we have a few,
a very few, even in these, our days of degeneracy, who
would have done some honour to the Roman and Greek
republicanism, when it was most awful, most simple,
and most unrelenting. We have men, that are stern as
death. The last age of course, being an age of
revolution
,
abounded more in the mighty. There were the
writers of the Federalist, of whom you speak. They
were good men, and true. Lately,
we
have contented
ourselves, with talking about what
they
did.
Our
great
men are content with reviewing the works of the great
men that lived then. Thus, Mr. Robert Walsh, who has
been persuaded into a notion that he is one of the former,
had the presumption, some years ago, to review the
Federalist
.
It was rather an unlucky adventure for him.
He praised parts, for
discoveries
, that were known, from
the time of Aristotle's politicks; and spoke lightly enough,
or not at all, of other parts, which really were great
discoveries
in legislation. In short, he wrote a review of
a work, the scope and greatness of which, he could not
comprehend, unless he were to begin his whole reading
again. But the people swallowed it; to their notion, it
vol. ii. P
was about the finest thing in the world; when, in
reality
,
it is an elaborate, tedious, timid piece of composition,
without one stroke of the lawyer, the statesman, or the
politician in it.
But, while I am upon Mr. Walsh, let me give you
some notion of him, as in your country he has been (when
he deserved it less,) mistaken for a great man.
Mr. Walsh is a man of no genius; if, by
genius
,
we are to understand any inherent, peculiar activity,
brilliancy, originality, or disposition of the mind. But,
he is a man of plain good sense; some intellectual
hardihood
,
but not much; and respectable acquirements.
He is rather below the middle size; with a
countenance
,
that indicates a cold, watchful, inquiring
disposition
,
united with a little self distrust, and too much
anxiety about the good opinion of other men. He is
destitute
of originality; and has nothing, absolutely nothing,
of that quick, intuitive perception of the beautiful and
natural, which is the distinguishing property of genius.
Consequently, his opinion, not being a
natural
judgment,
is not to be depended upon. No man on earth is more
firmly persuaded of his own independent temper, and
freedom from prejudice, than this gentleman;and
yet, it is well understood by them that know him, that
no man is more obedient to authorityor more a slave
to it:that under a great name, almost any thing would
pass, with himand that, under no name at all, or an
humble one, nothing,---except it were a matter of profit,
or to conciliate the publick. By this, I mean, for
example
that Mr Walsh is too distrustful of himself; and is,
in reality, so incapable of judging, except, by laborious
comparison, which keeps him under a continual fear of
imposition, that he would never dare, unless driven to it,
by the publick sentiment, to be the herald of any
unknown
genius.
He obtained a reputation too suddenly; and he could
not sustain it. But, he lost it, too suddenlyand will,
probably, recover a portion of it back again. He is far
from being a great man; but, I do believe that he is an
able oneabout a third raterand that, if he would get
a little the better of his oracular arroganceand stately
nothingnessthat profoundly classical air, which he
carries forever about himdischarge his heart of its
hoarded bitternessforgive the world, for having turned
his head; and for not keeping it turned, by main force;
become a little more magnanimous; and, a little less
unhappy and suspicious; a little more original and bold;
and conceal his alarm, when he is properly arraigned,
I do almost believe that he might do something
decent
,
to be remembered by. But, let me tell the whole
truth of the man. He went aloft, too fast and too far,
at first; and then, of course, he came down, too fast and
too far. He wants that high-minded intellectual
courage
,
which delights in breathing above the rest of men
and braving a stormy atmosphere; he dare not be the
first man to pronounce
any
opinionand, usually,
contrives
to be a little behind the sentiment of the publick;
taking care to fortify and entrench himself, at every step,
against any change in their opinion, by a cautious,
cold, qualifying, and stately phraseology, in which he
never commits himself. He affects to superintend the
wilderness of American literature; yet, no man, in
America
,
is worse fitted for the business. He wants a
natural
relish---and the natural power, for exploring the
beautiful labyrinth; disentangling the wild,
flowering
luxuriance; or laying open the abundant waters; and
hidden, solitary greenness of a great world, to the eye.
He wants courage and honesty. Like the writers of the
North American Review, he is destitute of feeling; and
all his enthusiasm is artificial; he has no heart, and dare
not hazard a downright opinion, either pro or con,
until
he have secured a party, to support him through it, or
to participate in the ridicule, if the publick should set him
at naught. A pretty example occurs to me, just at this
moment. Mr Walsh had the audacity, when Moore's
Loves of the Angels appeared, to treat it as a mawkish,
common-place, sensual piece of workand the North
American, in its usual tone, contrived to talk about it,
in a general way. And yet, there doesn't live the man,
who has any natural relish for poetry, that sap o' the
heart, which, in the sunshine and light of the world,
sets it a flowering all over---who can read it, without
a continual thrill, of quiet, deep thankfulness. Most of
it is pure poetrya part, sublimeand, all through it,
are spots of insupportable brightness and beauty. But,
to return again, for a moment, to Mr. Walsh.
He is but just beginning to find, after many
revolutions
,
a proper level. He thinks clearly; reasons with
great force, at times; and, were he not a little too much
addicted to Edmund Burke, whose passion and power he
is really unable to appreciate; but whom he has
sometimes
imitated, very unadvisedly, and awkwardly, I
think,he would be passably eloquent. Nay, I can
point to passages that are full of energy, boldness, and
breadth; and he has uttered, in the course of a long
political
career, two or three burning and bitter sarcasms,
which will, probably, outlast all else, that he has ever
written. As a critick, I think humbly of him, where
plain good sense, or fine taste is required.
In the matter of poetry, for example, he is utterly
incompetent
to decide. He has no feeling, no conception
of it. God has left that element out of his heart. And
education has only made him worse. Any tolerable
rhymer might impose upon him(were it not for his
reading
; for he appears to be quite familiar with the
old British poets, rather as a matter of education, like
geometry, than anything else.) almost anything, for
the labour of Milton, or Dryden, and a few other such
men. If he detected the counterfeit, it would not be by
any revolting of the heart; any indignant, wrathful,
movement of his blood; or outraged sensibilitybut, by
his
memory
. Enough for him, if it were written by them,
to consecrate the basest trash; and enough, if it were
not
,
to make him wonder at the absurdity of one, who should
think of attempting poetry, after such men! Robert
Walsh has no notion of the fact;and, if he were told of
itit would startle him, as if a thunderbolt had exploded
at his feetthat the very newspaper poets of the
nineteenth
century, often betray more of the richness,
raciness
,
sweetness and majesty; strength and simplicity;
nay, of all that constitutes poetry, than all the ancient
British Classicks together. Yet,
it is true
and if the man
had any heart, he would feel it; and, perhaps, for I think
that he has the worldly wisdom to do so, for his own
profithe would then tell the world of it.
Mr. Walsh ought to confine himself to serious,
substantial
essays; to discharge his heart of all political
rancour
;
and go about some such work as the history of
America; like a man that would build for himself,
something
more permanent than a newspaper fame, which
the first wind may scatter, and the first rain dissolve.
He ought never to touch the gentle and more spiritual
plants of literature, that issue from the airwithout
deriving
any nourishment from the earthor gush, like
coloured water, spontaneously, from the over-heated
earth, trembling in the wind, and flowering all over.
Yet he does touch themhe doesand they wither when
he doesand, tremble, as if endued with vitality and
sensationor shrink, as with a palsycontracting and
shivering, as at the approach of something
unnatural
and hateful. Thus, it is not long since, that he
had the presumption to fall upon Washington Irving (him,
that you so love, notwithstanding his sickly and
delicate
affectation,) in the way of criticism. But Mr. Walsh
had better let him alone. He was not the man to
detect the weak and sore places about the heart of
Irving
;
and he could no more understand the delicacy and
sensitiveness of such a nature, than Irving could, the
gigantick control of a statesmansitting
unconcerned
,
between the past and the futureand regulating the
operations of the present, with the steadiness of aDeity.
Let me give you an example. I remember one, where
Mr. Irving, in one of his happiest humours, when the
thought seemed to flow out of his heart, as from a
fountain
,
with a sweet, mournful and sorrowing musick
something imaginary and spiritualwith here and there
a faint flourish of cheerfulness;was telling
something
about an old family mansion, where the heaviness
and grandeur of other times, were perpetually intruded
upon, by the pert and flippant innovations of the present.
There was something of family pride, and patrician
jealousy
,
to be seen in the very furniture. And the older
chairs, said Mr. Irving, were all standing haughtily
together
,
and aloof from the modern onesas if they
associated
vol. ii. P 2
to rebuke and discountenance all further plebeian
encroachment. The thought was well-turned and natural
and I wish that I could remember the words; for I see
that I have spoilt it. Yet, Mr. Walsh dared to treat it
as a
conceit
. Nor was this all; he went through one of
the Sketch Books, with the same ignorant audacity; and
laid the iron hand of criticism, upon every beautiful and
innocent thought therecrushing, with a spiteful
emphasis
,
whatever appeared most timid and delicate. It
was barbarous. I have never forgiven him. There were
parts enough about Mr. Irving, accessible to one that
understood
himparts, that were diseased, and that
required
a stern and healthful application; but Mr. Walsh was
not the maneven if the medicine were put into his
hand, to drug a spirit like Irving. They could never
touchnever approach, without a mutual jarring of
antipathy
.
As well might the men that
Carve at their meal
With gloves of steel;
And drink their red wine through helmets barred:
amuse themselves with nursing geraniumsa;or,
attempt
to battle with shadows; and minister, with the
dagger and chalice in their hand, to a mind diseased.
Mr. Irving is no poetMr. Walsh is no poet. But the
former has a natural relish for poetry; and the latter has
no relish at all, either natural or acquired. Both affect a
poetical feeling:but it is less ridiculous in the former,
because there is, with all his sentimentality and
squeamishness
,
and melancholy, a holy, quiet and sweet spirit,
forever haunting the lonely avenues to his brain.
And no man writes so happily, so touchingly, so
naturally
,
when his spiritualizing refinement gives way for a
moment. And then his humourhow captivating it is!
You are delighted; and you have no trouble in
communicating
your delight. You have no argument, no
reasoning
to wasteyou have only to point to the page, and
the thing is done. ObserveI do not speak of his BRACE
BRIDGE HALLthat,
you
are to answer for. It is a
disgrace
to Irving; and a disgrace to his countrymen.
It is altogether
English
.
Such is the character of Mr. Irving; such that of Mr.
Walsh. It is perfectly ridiculous for the latter to talk
of poetry, or sentiment. They are something, of which
he has not, and never had the faintest conception. Nor
is it necessary that he should have. He will get along
the faster in this world; and die a wiser and richer man,
than if he had. A relish for poetry never helped to
make any man truly
great
. It may make him
interesting
,
or ridiculousbut nothing more. And when Mr.
Walsh laid his hand, with the best disposition in the
world, I dare say, to nurse them, upon the violets that
Irving had tufted the green earth with, about his
dwelling
and
crushed themhad that hand been stung to
death, he would have deserved it, for his blundering
but he hath left some blood upon the flowersand carried,
away, what he is yet ignorant ofa perfume, that is not
natural to him.
I hardly know what to say of our other writers. They
are numerous enough; and, oftentimes, well
characterized
.
But our taste is bad. Our literature is corrupt and
eprverted; one class of our writers are all of the sleepy,
milk and water-school of Addison; another, intemperate
and florid. They never change charactersnever. No
matter what may be the theme, their language is the
same. They gothe former, to a fire as to a funeral;
and the latter, to a funeral as to a fire. One is never
on stilts; the other, always. As a people, we are too fond
of the unnaturally smooth, continued and entangled
sentence. Nothing else is classical with us. No
matter
how abrupt and hazardous the thought is, in its
nakedness
,
it is not the etiquette of our school, to reveal it
boldly;and, when you should be able to pursue the
meaning, as vividly, as a creature wrought upon
tapestry
,
you find it so warped and webbed into it, with
such perpetual involution, departure and entanglement,
that is impossible to follow it; and you throw the work
by, as you would a web of different coloured yarns,
where all was beautiful, and brilliant, and unmeaning.
It were easy to give you a specimen of the higher style
among usit is not a little like what you may see every
day, in the labour of men, who have been drilled after
artificial
models;and, if you turn to your Edinburgh
Review
,
you will, now and then, find the happiest
illustration
.
It is a work of great influence here; and, though
I defy you to point out a page of English, in the last two
volumes,unpolluted with jargon, barbarism, or
provincialism
,
yet it is one of
our
standards.
Some are men, like Dr. Johnson, who never know
what to do with a big word, or when to let it go.They
crowd epithet upon epithet, until their style is a sort of
dislocated blank verse. One distinct blow will leave a
distinct impression. Many blows will leave none at all.
One seal, though it be a feeble one, set fairly, will leave
an impression; where many, that are more beautiful, put
one upon the other, will leave none. In reading, one
emphatick word, properly applied, may electrify you:
many have no effect at all. So,
one
powerful thought,
though it be not the very best in the world, will be
remembered
forever, when judiciously applied, where
many
that are better, if crowded together, will be forgotten,
as soon as heard. The attention is distracted; the
faculties
chafed and irritated, by the multiplication of good
words; and the immeasurable length of what are called
classical sentences. Do men talk so, in conversation?
Do they even declaim, or think so? No. Then why do
they write so? Should not their writing be a transcript
of their thought? One would think, sometimes, that the
words which they use, had been stumbled upon, and that
they, fearful of not finding them again, when they should
want them, had huddled them all in together-to make sure
of them: or, that they were willing to become familiar
with them by useno matter when or whereas people
rehearse, very unseasonably, at times, what they hope to
practise, on some other occasion,
impromptu:
or, that
they were lecturing on tautology.
Such writers, if they had a dozen seals, would never
be satisfied with giving you the impression of any
one
of
them, upon a letter. No! they would stamp the whole
set, one upon the other.
It were as rational, to hope, by writing again and
again, over what is already written, in different
coloured
ink, (which is admitting that the words are not synon
imous) in the hope of rendering you thought more
distinct
?
But, so it is; and there are men among us, who seem
to have a constitutional dread of coming to the point
and some of them pass for orators.They approach a
subject as if it were a wild beast, by going round and
round it; and there is one man,
[10]
[10]
A lawyerI know him, too.
Ed
.
a smooth, gentlemanly,
agreeable speaker, to all the world, among whose
qualifications
,
beside that of never ending a sentence, never!
---is that of never touching his subject, but as if it were
a globeand all the extremities of his fingers were
globular
too; of course they cannot touch but in one point,
and
that
, he seems to avoid, with a mortal dislike:---and,
sometimes, when I have known him to blunder, with the
most innocent countenance in the world, upon it---I have
seen him thrown back, as if electrified.---Yet, he always
keeps on, with the same quiet manner, as if nothing in
the world had happened.--Nay, if he ran against a line of
battle-ship, or an island, while he was playing about in his
painted cock-boat;---and were sent to the bottom, he
would be the last to suspect it himself---or, as soon as
he could get his breath, he would, probably, be the first
man to condole with both, for
their
shipwreck!
I think that I may give you an illustration of his
manner
,
and that of some of our writers, at the same time.--
If one might be permitted, under any circumstances
whatever, to think that a transaction so notorious, had
been perpetrated as it was, I should be inclined to say,
quite positively, if I am not mistaken, and do rightly
understand the subject, which I must confess is a very
difficult one, as I have, on more than one occasion said,
with considerable emphasis to the gentlemen of this
society
,
for which, if I am wrong, I humbly submit myself
to the reproof of the chair, which has been so long
filled
with a dignity and courtesy, that, if I may be
allowed
to express my opinionfor there is nothing, which I
more heartily depise, than adulation, I should say, in
short sirit is my opinion thatif the subject were
rightly
considered, it would be found very difficult, very
difficult
indeed.
You smilemy dear friend. But there is more than
one man in America, who writes and talks such
deliberate
smooth nonsense as thatand that too, without the
slightest suspicion, in his own mind, or that of a hearer,
that he is paddling about and about the subject. But
he talks onlike your parliamentary speakers,
permitting
no pause or break in the sound; and knowing that
there is no memory to follow him; and that the
note-takers
will make English of it, at their leisureand
imagine
a meaning, if it be possible; or, if that cannot be,
make an apology, and totally omit it; or add that the
articulation of the gentleman was so timid and faint, or
so rapid and vehement; or, that they were carried away
by his eloquence, so confounded by the noise that
followit
,
that, they have done him great injustice--injustice!
--the cruellest thing, that they could do, would be to do him
justice
.
You speak of Mr. Trumbull.There is, to be sure, a
great deal of humour and drollery about him; but he is
no poet. Yet we have poetspoets, of every character
and degree; and more than one that, if he were in your
country, would be placed in the first rank. There is a
young man, (whose name I know not) at New-York,
who has just been amusing us with a tissue of wit, whim
and poetry, that show him to have within him, powers
of the most varied and attractive character. Nay, some
of his lines would make your blood thrilland there
are passages in his Fanny, (a poem written in
imitation
of Don Juan) that Lord Byron, himself, could not
read, without a flutter of pride at the heart. The worst
fault of our poets, is, that they will borrow and imitate.
This I cannot endure. Yet all of them are guilty of it
allI cannot except one. Some affect originality too,
to such an excess, that you are kept aching eternally
after
the thought. Such men would not do the
commonest
thing in a common way.There is the author of
Niagara
,
for example-the chief notion that he has of greatness,
is that of being unlike everybody else.He would'nt use
his pocket-handkerchief, I dare say, as other people use
theirs. But why complain of our poets for imitation?
when yours are literally a school of imitators. I can
trace half a dozen to WordsworthThere is Colridge
HuntBary Comwalland even Byron himself. Nay,
show me one page of your English poetry, ancient or
modern, of unadulterated originality; and I will go down
on my knees before it. There is a Mr. Allen, also, here,
whom I have already mentioned to you, who makes
poetry
when
he least intends it;and almost always fails
when he goes about it, in downright earnest. There is
a Mr. Pierpont too, who has written one or two poems,
that have been praised all over our countryfor
everything
that is wonderful or pleasant, among the anointed
of Apollo. One reveres his chief poem, for its strength and
grandeur--another, for its sweetness and tenderness--one
for this, and another for that. And nothing can be more
ridiculous. There is no intoxication; no delirium;
nothing
of the marvellous in it. It is a temperate, mild,
beautiful affairand that is all; but some of his little
poemsa few hymnsare among the most exquisite in
our language.
The poet's mind appears too much warped and
trammelled
by his fondness for Beattie and Campbell, and
that school, ever to astonish. He never alarms nor
inflames
he
never thunders nor lightensthere are no
phenomena, agitated into life, by his sorcerybut there
are passages of surpassing
beauty
, and vividness in his best
poem; with quite too much that is feeble and common place.
There is also a Mr. Bryant, of whom I know nothing,
except that I once saw some lines, a very few, that
awed
me.
He
is a poet. There is a Mr. Osborne too, of
whom you may have heard a good deal, because for the
last ten years, he was the only standard poet of our
country. Yet what has he written?It were difficult to
tell. Some short pieces of fifty or an hundred lines
with here and there a great thought; but never a whole
page of poetry in his life.
[11]
[11]
Where is Mr. Southwick?
Ed
.
There is Dr. Percival, who,
if he had not been praised by Mr. Walsh, I should call a
very fine poet; but, as it is, I do confess that I am in doubt;
and, were it not for certain lines to Consumption; and
a few very beautiful passages in certain other short
pieces
of his, I should not have mentioned him. But they
are delightfulfull of composure, delicacy, and tender
feelinga natural melancholy, and rich harmony. He
wants boldness, originality and vehemence; but he is a
man of unquestionable genius, and an honour to our
country
.
The worst of it is, that our men of genius, have a
foolish notion, that, to be melancholy, unsocial, and
misanthropical, is the only way to prove to the world,
that they are men of genius. Alasthere are ailments
of the constitution and heart, common to men of
sensibility
,
and they
are
always men of genius, which, if they
are wise, they will rather conceal than betray. It is
humiliating to be pitiedbut, to be pitied by the world, is
enough to kill a poetical nature, while in actual flower;
enough to freeze the sweet fountain that trembles in his
heart, at every change of the atmosphere about
it---foretelling
sunshine and rain, the sunshine and rain of
popular
favour, like a barometer. So much for Dr. Percival.
And then there is Mr. Paulding.---By the way, can you
ascertain who wrote the notices of his
Backwoodsman
,
in some of your papers.
He
is charged with it, here---
but I cannot believe such a thing. I am more
charitable
.
The poem is a silly, affectedly simplesluggish
stupifyng affair, enough, to be sure; but there is a very
good reason why it should be favourably received in
England
,
without charging Mr. Pas the author of the
reviews. This was your policy. I understand it. By
taking up the Backwoodsman, and praising it, as you
have, for the
best
specimen of our transatlantick poetry;
what must your good people have thought of the
rest
.
The best specimen of our poetry!gracious heavenwe
have boys, mere children, who would weep, for shame, to
be suspected of the authorship, although some passages
are very fine and very free.
Yet Mr. Paulding is really a man of talent. Some
of his prose is excellent. He is only a little too
ambitious
;
and, in attempting to balance himself for the higher
regions of composition, he shivered awhileeddied, and
then came downfor what reason it might be difficult to
tellupon his head. His letters from
Old England
,
however, are an honour to him and to us.
[12]
[12]
Not
his
.
Ed
.
One cannot
help loving his heart, and admiring his head, when less
indiscriminately employed.
There is a Mr. Fessenden also, who once buttoned
himself up; and mounted the stilts of rhymebut, he had
better remained in proseslept quietlyand been
gathered to his fathers, for what he is, in all probability,
a troublesome, honest, well meaning sort of a man.
There was also another young manI dont know his
name, who wrote a poem called Chrystalina, some years
ago, in New-York. It was a work of extraordinary
merit, though very tedious; less for a want of power and
opulence of thought in the author, than from his
fearfulness
,
and unwillingness to lose aught that he had once
written:good or bad, in it wentwith all its variations.
He might be made a great poet.
There is another man too, named Neale,
[13]
[13]
NEALnot
Neate
. There is an English poet of the latter name; and a ScotHenry and
Hector.
Ed
(did I
mention
him?) who has written some poemsahistory
and a tragedy; the latter of which, comes nearer, I should
imagine, to your notions of the sublime than any thing
of the day. It is darkness and mystery from beginning
to end. The catastrophe is strikingbut nobody can
understand it. And so with his poetry. You are
alarmed
,
agitated,but it would be difficult to tell why. He
affects scholarship; yet a part from some shocking
blunders
in latin, such as
exitomnes; Ala
, a woman
solus
.
There are some barbarisms and vulgarities, that will
constantly provoke you. For instance, he makes one
of his characters ask,
who
have I slain?
who
have I
hidden, &c.and his chief notion of blank verse would seem
to be, that it should consist of ten syllables
more or less;
and, sometimes, one would fancy that he had written a
page or two, while in heat;and then, counted off the
words, into lines of ten or a dozen syllables each;for
very often, where the thought is strong and beautiful,
there is a total want of rhythm and cadence. But alas!
it is the fashion of the age. He affects too, a
colloquial
manner, even on the most solemn occasion. His
names too, are infinitely amusingturkishand
christian. O-la is a heroand A-la, a heroine in the
same piece!
Achmet, Selim and Otho
. Did you ever
vol. ii. Q
read Barry Cornwall's
Mirandola
? I send you a copy
of
Otho
. Compare the passages that I have marked, for
yourself. Are not such resemblances astonishing? Otho
was published a long time before Mirandola. It is not
at all probable, that Barry Cornwall; or, rather, Mr.
Proctor
, had even seen it; for, it is but little known in
America: and
if
he had seen it, will any man suppose
that so fine a genius would borrow so largely from an
unknown American tragedy. The very words are the
same, in more than one case; and the sentiments.
manner
,
and incidents more surprisingly alike, than those
of
Manuel
and
Lear
. I was very forcibly struck with
them; and, it was not till I had satisfied myself, that Otho
had been first published here, that I could believe
them to be accidental. I have recently seen a novel of
his, called
Keep Cool
a foolish, fiery thingwith a good
deal of nature and originality; and much more than a
good deal of nonsense and flummery in it. There is a
history of the American Revolution too, part of which
was written by him;most shamefully printedit comes
out under the name of
Paul Allen
. There are other
works attributed to him; but denied, it is said, by him;
one of which, called
Logan
is, to my notion, little other
than one interminable dreamwithout moral or
design
but
alive with some tremendous apparitions: and
another, called
Seventy-six
, which I cannot but think
altogether
too good, and too great a work for him to have
written. There are really some meaning, and some sort of
design, to be seen in Seventy-Six.
His characteristick as a POET, isa laboured originality
in every thing; which is exceedingly ridiculous. He seems
to have no settled design; no purpose in view, but merely
to rhyme on, head over heels, page after page, as if to
get rid of some delirium upon him.He rains his imagery
upon you; and rages through all heaven and earth for
epithets; and nothing is more common than for him,
when comparing one thing with another, to add half a
dozzen
gratuitous comparisons to each. Thus, he will say
that such a sky is like the blush of a fountain, at sunset
which is like the plumage of a seraphim, ruffled and
rippling all over, in the windwhich plumage is like
changeable silkwhich silk is like the ocean, in a calm,
covered with oily gold and green,like some steely
weapon in the setting sunand here, you perceive, he
gets back to just where he started from. But enough
of himYou never could get through his poem, I am
sure; and the story goes that his own mother took to her
bed, when it apeared, and has not held up her head
since.
But after all, I don't see any great use in poetry.
Whatever can be said
well
in poetry, may be said
better
in prose. The chief advantage of poetry is, that it may
be more easily remembered; and transmitted, by
tradition
.
But, tradition and memory are repositories,
altogether
too expensive and uncertain, while books are
so plenty and so cheap. One might as well commit a
geography as a poem, now. In the time of Homer and
Ossian, it was very different; geography, itself, could
only be transmitted in poetry.
Another mischief in poetry, (I speak of what other
men call poetry---
rhythm, cadence, measure
, and
rhyme
,
which are not at all essential to what
I
call poetry,) is,
that it leads us to admire a thing for its
difficulty
apart
from all consideration of its beauty or utility. I cannot
do this. Hence, I do not love the learning of the German
musick, nor the refinement of the modern Italian;nor
can I endure their opera dancing. So thought
Alexander
,
when he rewarded the man, who amused him by
shooting small seed through the eye of a needle, with
miraculous dexterityby presenting him with a half
bushel of seed. Yet, what is rhyme, and all the
artificial
constraints of poetry, but the vestiges of that
barbarous
taste, which formerly delighted in conundrums,
acrosticks, rebuses, riddles, and alliteration? It is
worse. Pope, to be sure, persuaded himself that he
could
rhyme
, better than he could
prose
. I do not deny
it. He was never eloquent or impassioned. He never
thought
poetry
, nor understood it. He was naturally
addicted to epigramsententious, laconick, pungent,
stinging brevity:---but, notwithstanding his authority,
I say, that men
naturally
seek to express themselves in
prose;
and that
rhyme
and
cadence
, and all that, are only
temptations to a round-about, inadequate mode of
expression---so
that you never get the
first thought
of a
poet
, except in a prosaick passage.
Nor is it all wonderful, that, after a time, men should
have come to accept of poetical
language
for poetical
thought;
the embellishments of poetry, for poetry itself,
as they have at this day. Take any page of what you
call poetry, that you will, ancient or modern; and I
will point to a page of what the world call prose, which
shall contain more poetical thought and expression.---
Look at our modern poems, I care not whose, and you
will be ashamed of your foolish infatuation, if you come
to examine the thought
nakedly;
the number and variety;
the beauty, freshness, and originality of the pictures.---
How much of it is poetical
language!
How little of it
poetical
thought!
I hope to see this done with. I believe that I shall
live to see it done with. I do not say this, out of
ignorance
or obstinacy; for I can write poetrywhat men
call poetry, quite as readily as I can prose; and I
conscientiously
believe what I am saying; nay, moreI
believe
that the age of poetry is past; that such men as
Lord Byron, had better throw by poetry, altogether; and
take up prose writing, if they want to be remembered,
for another century. He is coming to it, already, step
by step, in the perverseness of Childe Harold, and his
tragedies
;and
in the familiar, colloquial manner of Don Juan.
Let them write fictionbut, let their fiction be in prose;
let them put out all their power, upon a literature that
all may read, century after centuryI do not mean
quote
, and keep in their libraries, but
read
. The
day of the Epick has gone by, never to return. No
matter
what may become of the worldit will never be
again, a sufficient time, under the dominion of any one
people, nation or tongue, for any one poem, ever to
become
,
again, a work of immortality, or even of national
pride.
But, what shall these men write?Novels or
Romances
?If
they aim to instruct the publick, the very
multitude; and not to allure or amaze, let them write
Novels
,
like those of Miss Edgworth; which are fine,
natural
models, destitute of phrensy; useful, and uniformly
attractive; but, if they aim to do something more; to take
captive the hearts of the mighty; let them write
Romances
,
with such kind of exaggeration, as you find in
the best parts of the Waverly novels;but let it be more
frequent, and lasting, vivid and intense. I say
exaggeration
because,
if there be no exaggeration, there will be
none of that trance-like agitation and excitement, which
nothing but poetry can produce in the blood of men. Are
the incidents and characters of the Waverly novels
natural
?
No.They are all exaggerated, more or less;
and the best parts of the whole, are the most exaggerated
such as the characters of Jenny Deame, Bailey Jarvis,
Claverhouse, Meg Merrilies, &c. &c. and that is the
reason,---because they are
unnatural;
and not, because they
are
natural
, that they affect us; unnatural, I mean,
because
they are not like any thing in the
nature
of our
experience. If they were, we should care little for them.
In one sense, they are natural, because we do not see,
at once, that they are impossible. Nor, are they
historically
true, in one single case.
YesI do, in my heart, believe that we shall live to
see poetry done away withthe poetry of form, I mean---
of rhyme, measure, and cadence. Yet, in place of it, will
arise a mightier poetry, which will be the work of the
mightiest. The revolution is at hand; men are trying
every kind of experiment, to perpetuate their strength, in
the eternal language of musick and poetry; and they
will, I have no doubt, leave such a legacy behind them,
in what the world now call prose, that another
generation
will treat what this calls poetry, as
we
now treat the
alliteration and acrosticks
of the generations that are gone.
But will
poetry
itself become extinct. No, never.
You never can put out that light. As well might you
hope to blot out the polar system. No: poetry is the
divinity within us. It will be the better understood;
and far more devoulty worshipped, when this
revolution
shall have taken place; when the great, beautiful
thought
, of the anointed among men,shall be
disincumbered
of words without meaning. Poetry is the naked
expression of power and eloquence. But, for many
hundred
years---poetry has been confounded with false
musick---measure
and cadence---the soul with the body---the
thought with the language---the manner of speaking,
vol. ii. Q 2
with the mode of thinking. The secondary qualities of
poetry have been mistaken for the primary ones.
What I call poetry, has nothing to do with art or
learning
.
It is a natural musick---the musick of woods and
waters
;
not that of the orchestra. It is a fine, volatile essence,
which cannot be extinguished or confined, while there is
one drop of blood in the human heart, or any sense of
Almighty God, among the children of men. I do not
mean this, irreverently---I mean, precisely, what I say---
that poetry is a religion as well as a musick. Nay---
it is eloquence.---It is, whatever affects, touches, or
disturbs
the animal or moral sense of man. I care not
how poetry may be expressed, nor in what language, it
is still poetry; as the melody of the waters, wherever
they may run; in the desert or the wilderness; among
the rocks or the grass, will always be melody. It is
not artificial musick---the musick of the head---of
learning
,
or of science; but it is one continual voluntary of the
heart; to be heard every where---at all times---by day--
and by night, whenever men will stay their hands, for
a moment, or lift up their heads and listen. It is not the
composition of a master; the language of art, painfully
and entirely exact; but, it is the wild, capricious melody
of
nature
---pathetick or brilliant, like the roundelay
of innumerable birds whistling all about you, in the wind
and watersky and air; or the coquetting of a river breeze
over the fine strings of an Eolian harp---concealed among
green leaves and apple blossoms.
All men talk poetry, at some time or other, in their
lives; even the most reasonable, cold-hearted,
mathematical
and phlegmatick; but most of them, without knowing
itand women, yet more frequently, than men: and young
children too, talk it, perpetually, when alarmed or
delighted
.
Yet they never talk in rhyme; nay, nor in blank
verse. Even the writers of tragedythe most perverse
of God's creaturesdo now and then, stumble upon this
truthfor, in all their passionate and deepest passages,
they do all that they can, to get rid of the foolish restraint
of rhythm. And when they do notthey are, to the
full, as absurd as the opera-singerwho murders and
makes love, by the gamut.
Poetry too, is the natural language of the human
heartits
mother-tongue;
and is, just as naturally
resorted
to, on any emergency or distress, by the devoutthe
terrifiedthe affectionatethe tender-hearted and the
lovingthe widowed and the afflictedas a man's native
tongue is, when, after having been a great while among
strangers, where he has learnt a strange language, good
enough for all the common purposes of lifehe is called
upon, by some signal, and unexpected calamity, to pray
aloud; or to cry out, with a broken and bowed spirit, or
a crushed heart. Instantly, that man over-leaps all time
and spaceand, falls down, before the woman that he
loves; or his Maker, with the very language that his
mother
taught him, when he fell upon his little knees, and
lisped the dictated prayer after her, syllable by syllable.
Just so, it is, with poetry. Prose will do for common
people; or, for all the common occasions of life, even
with uncommon people. We cannot drive a better
bargain
,
or make a better argument in poetry, than in prose.
But strike us here, into our very vitals, with some
weapon
of fire; and see how instantly a combustion takes place,
inwardlywithin all of usflaming at our eyes, and
trembling on our tongues, like inspiration. The poetry
within us takes fire, and becomes audible and visible.
We might have died, without thinking that we were
combustible, but for something that had jarred all our
blood, like an earthquake.
I speak of this matter, freely and boldly, because I
know that I am competent to speak of itand fully
authorized
to bear witness against the mischievous and
perverted tendencies, of poetical thought, when it is
put, like a beautiful child, or a strong giant, into shackles
and gyves; hand-cuffs and pinions. Some men affect to
talk about it; and to give rule for it, who never had a
poetical
idea in their heads. Fools! they might as well
learn eloquence from an automation; or swimming, by
seeing other people swim, as how to make poetry, by
reading
and studying the great mastersand listening to the
jackasses, who are called criticks; not one, in a million of
whom ever was, or ever will be a poet. Why?because
if a man be a poet, he will lack, nine hundred and ninety
nine times out of a thousand, either the judgment; or the
moral courage; or the honesty, to criticise boldly; and to
speak of poetry as it deserves; and more than that, if
he be a
poet
, he will be above the practice of criticism.
My notion, in one word, isthat poetry is the natural
language of every human heart, when it is roused--or
inflamed
,
or agitated, or affected: and that prose, on the
contrary, is the natural language of every human heart,
on all other occasions; and that rhyme, or blank verse,
or
regular
rhythm, is altogether as artificial, unnatural
and preposterous a mode of expression, for the true
poet
;
as the use of a foreign idiom, or foreign phrase, is
to the true home-bred man. The Romans affected to
talk Greek; the Germans do talk Frenchas if they were
ashamed of their mother language; and so do poets talk
in rhyme or blank versebut, let them all talk ever so
beautifully, one can always discover that it is not
natural
to either of them. They are too Atticor too
provincialtoo exact, or too slovenly.
To put this in another light---one example will do
more than a volume of abstract reasoning. Could you
possibly hold out to read any poem, by the greatest
poet
that ever lived, which should contain as many words,
as one of the Waverly novels? It would be about five
or six times as long, as Paradise Lost. If it were the
best of poetry, would you not get the sooner tired of
it? Assuredly. In the confusion of such a beautiful and
confounding exhibition of power and brightness, your
senses would lose all their activity: they would reel
under it; and retain no distinct impression at all.
It would be like seeing a multitude of beautiful women,
at the same momentin a place, crowded with august
personagesinnumerable picturesstatuarydelicious
musick and fire works.What would you remember of
the whole?nothing.
How many volumes of prose
do
you read in a year?
and how many would you read, if the same things were
told in verse! Probably not a hundredth part, as
many
as you do now; hence the superiority of prose, if
one want to convey instruction, or amusement; or
obtain
reputation, glory, or popularity.
Do not tell me that poetry will out-last prose. That
is no longer true. More volumes of poetry are written
now, in one year, than there used to be of prose, in a
century
,
before the invention of printing. Epicks are out
of fashion: poetry cannot live, unless it be
continually
read:
and no poetry will be so continually read as
fine prose
.
But if the prose be
very
finevery pungent, great,
fiery and beautifulit will not be relished by the mob.
Hence madam de Staehl is not
popular:
and, hence, the
Waverly novels
are;
nay, in proportion to the great
excellence of any writer, will be the limited number of
his admirers. He, who means to be popular, must
dilute
not only his charactersincidentsand doctrines,
but his thought and language. He must make his
heroes
angels or devilsSir Charles Grandisons, or Laras
and Marmions:in that, he must do as the
Waverly
man has done; but even he has not diluted enough.
Therefore, miss Edgeworth will outlast him in
popularity;
not that her
power
is worthy of comparison, for a
moment
,
with hisin realityyet, in another age, it
will be far more highly appreciated, and more
generally
understood
She
is always on a level with the
ordinary
capacities of men.
The result of all that I can say, therefore, is, that
the first rate works of geniusno matter of what kind
never have beenare notand never will be, so generally
popular, as the second or third rate
.
All men quote Shakspeare and Milton; and often
without knowing it; yet who reads either? I have never
met with but one man who had read
Paradise Lost
throughor who was willing to acknowledge it;and
he made a boast of it, as if he had achieved something
miraculous: adding, with a shake of the headwhen
he was asked his opinion of it, that, for his part
other
men might say what they pleasedbut it was a
dd fine poemonly he
did'nt believe more than one
half of it
. So with Mad. de Staehl. Every body talks
about heryet who reads her?only the eloquent and
polite; and half of them, because they are ashamed not
to have read her.
[14]
[14]
So with Rousseau's Heloise
. Who ever read
that
a second time?
Ed.
Yet, had all these persons written in
an humble style, they would have been, at this hour,
in the hands, and upon the tables of all the world, as the
Spectator, and the Vicar of Wakefield have been.
Stay here is a newspaper, open before me. Now I
will make a bet, that, on opening it. I shall find some
foolish quotation, from no matter whom, but somebody,
who is only quoted, not read; which will travel through
every paper in Americasolely because the newspaper
editors are attracted by it, in the page,no matter
what is tailed to it. Just as I thought! Here is an
account of a black woman, who killed herself for love,
or jealously. So the editor introduces the story with
Jealousy, the green ey'd monster,
That
makes
the meat it feeds on.
There Stafford!six months hence, you may open a
paper from Alabama; some part of the interiour, where
they have just heard of the abdication of Napoleon; and
are beginning to make a fuss about the Baltimore mob;
the sea serpent; or your trial of the queenand you will
find that very quotation. Yet nobody can tell why it
was there; and as for the merit of the thought, can any
thing be more beastlyor less beautifulor aptor
descriptive of that passion Jealousy, whom even
Collins, in his paroxysm of inspiration, has described
but feeblythat pale woman, with the haggard-lip.
Nay, the very
best
poetry, and the purest of old times,
may be met with
now
, in such constant use, that we
are no longer affected by it, in any way. These
newspaper
men cannot speak of children, but as the
pledges
of affection:
of a fire, but as the
devouring element
;
of death, but as the insatiate archer; nor of the dew,
on the grass, but as the gems of the morning.
What shall be done to them? what,
for
ourselves: let us
be distinguished by our simplicity, on all common
occasions
,
by a
language always fitted to the subject
.
Remember
my words. A great revolution is at hand.
Prose will take precedence of poetry:
or rather
poetry
will
disencumber itself of rhyme and measure; and talk in
prosewith a sort of rhythm, I admitfor there never
was an eloquent sentence, written or spoken, since the
creation of the world, without a rhythm and cadence
in ita musick of its ownit is a part of the nature of
eloquence, to be poetical and melodious. Yes, I repeat
it
Poetical thought, written like prose, will yet
supersede
poetry
, in the affection and reverence of the age.
Rhyming will be confined to songsand blank verse to
sonnets:chiefly, that the former may be remembered;
and the latter wondered at, like any foolish exercise of
ingenuity.
Finally, there is a Mr. Walterthe author of some
strange, beautiful, trashy, fantastick and disordered
poetry. Yet he has written but little, and I cannot
waste my time on him. So much for our poets. I have
enumerated all that I can now recollect. Good night
one of these days I shall answer the rest of your inquiries.

SAME TO SAME.
I am more composed, this morning, dear Juliet;nay
this afternoon, I should say, for I never opened my
eyes, after I shut them, last night, until about an hour
since. It is near evening now. The letter, that I began
yesterday, has gone, I see I am afraid that it will
distress
you, dear Juliet;and I am sorry that I gave
the order, as I did last night; but then, I did not expect
to be so well. I have nobody to blame;poor Mary
did, just as I ordered; she put the letter in the office, at
the last moment, before the mail went outand the
doctor
forbade her to wake me.
Yes, Juliet, I am in New-York. Nay, more---I
have set my heart upon a disclosure; and I will not be
baffled now, though it cost me my life. It is one of shame,
terrour, and dishonour, Julietyes,
dishonour
, for I have
fallen in my own respect; and I shall not spare myself.
I have met Randolph again. You were right, in your
belief. I loved himeven without suspecting it. But I
was awake, before I received your letter, Juliet.
YesI have met him again. He fledand Ieven
I, Juliet, have followed him here! What think you now,
of your
sister
, Juliet? I disdain to palliateto shrink
--or tremble. I am prepared for every thingfor
anything
.
My whole nature is changed. I am no longer
sensible to fright and remorse;no, nor to shame. I am
indifferent almost
almost
, Juliet, to thy opinion. Judge
then, to what a depth I have fallen. I am sitting alone,
aloneno mortal near memy countenance, I am sure,
is very stern; and big drops of sweat are falling upon
the paper, as I write. What supports me?I know not.

too intently,my head was low; and, when I arose, it

12
o'clock
.
I have had my table brought to my bed side; and, lest
my strength should not endure to the conclusion, I will
begin with that which is the sum and substance of all
that I have to say;---and finish the letter, as I can.
Spencer Randolph is a married man
.
There!---there! Juliet, I defy thee, now; I have told it!
---my heart is lighter, by a world.
But let me tell thee, just as it happened, how I
arrived
at the truth.
I loved Randolph, as I have told thee, before; but I
loved him, before I knew it; and, when I knew it, I cried
for shame and vexation. How had he won me? I knew
notI was afraid of him:and the only thing, I believe
it was the only thingthat really touched my heart, in
his whole deportment, was the tone of his voice.
That
used to thrill through and through me, particularly
when he read. I knew not what secret power the man
had over my thought; but, it did seem, that he
understood
every pulsation of my heart; and read
to
all the
mysterious movement within me; for, whatever he read,
seemed to have a fiery adaptedness; a something, fit and
appropriate to my very thought and feeling at the time.
I was unaccustomed to tenderness. I had ridiculed it.
The tenderness of the worldof the stageof novels,
was all sickening to me;but hisah, it was so deep,
and strange and passionate, that my heart caught the
infection, and palpitated at his voice, as if there was
something alive
here
, that answered every word. But I
awoke. I perceived my danger. Yet I strove to
conceal
the knowledge from him. I deceived myself. We
parted, as
friends;
and I felt as if a part of my own
heart had been torn away.I began to view my
conduct
.I
vol. ii. R
was very sick and low spirited. There was
something
to tremble for, I confess;and yet, I could find
little to blame, in him. It had been rather my fault,
than his.I had thrown myself,
literally
, upon his
bosom
,
in the consternation of my thought, when the first
feeling of love came to me; and what could he do?
He could not cast me off. There was only one way
left. He adopted it. He fled. Nayto consummate
his purpose, and to atone for his own thoughtlessness,
he affected to be cheerful and
friendly;
and, when he
wrote to me, it was to prove that he felt nothing, to keep
him silent; and nothing to make his pen treacherous to
himself or to me.That letter, I sent to you. Your
answer came, nearly at the same time, with another
from him.
another
, that almost drove me mad. What
was I to do? I had still enough of my native character
left, to take a resolution; and to carry it into effect, on the
spot, though it ruptured every blood-vessel within me.
I wrote to thee, Juliet;and to him,to him, as I
thought, for the last time. I felt sickand I felt a
melancholy pleasure that I was:the time might
come, thought I, when,
he
for I thought only of him
you were forgotten, Julietand my heavenly Father
was forgotten, in my humiliation,when
he
might weep
for me, as for one untimely perishing. There was a
sweet, dangerous consolation, in the thought.
An answer came. I read it. I shook with affright. I
felt myself accountable for whatever might
happen
.
I wrote to the mad-man, to stay his hand, until
my next letter arrived.He obeyed me;and, when
the post came ininstead of the letter, he received
me
me
to his bosom; sick, even unto death, and terrified,
almost to dissolution.His countenance was death
struck.-I stood in the street.-I know not if I were
recognised
I
care not:all that I know is, that I found him
alive:-and that, when I put my lips to his handit was in
the street, Juliet,I would have died there willingly
that they might have grown to it. I stood quaking
before him. His lips quivered. He threw his cloak
round meand asked me where, in the name of heaven,
we should go.I cared notI told him soI was
ready
to go any where with him.Nosaid he
affectionately
.
No, Sarah, though you forget yourself---
I will not forget you. The rebuke went to my heart.
It was cold, though tender. But it was the rebuke of a
brother, more than that of a lover.---I could not bear it---
I burst into tears.---I believe, that I fainted---at all
events, I know that I was insensible; for, when I opened
my eyes, I was sitting by a fire,---a snug little family of
quakers about me, and Randolph was holding my hands,
---and the room was full of camphor and spirit. I
was quite ill that night; and I saw no more of him,
until
the next morning. But he sent to enquire for me.---
In the evening, we came to an explanation. He loves
me---I am sure that he loves me:---and I glory in it!---
glory in it?---glory in the love of a
married
man!---
* * * Am I not fallen, indeed!---O, Juliet,
Juliet, pity me.---He fell upon his knees.---He besought
me to forgive him, and forget him;---and, when he
discovered
how deeply he had injured me,---I thought
that he would go distracted upon the spot.---Some
strange, mysterious words escaped him;---and his
forehead
quaked, as with the passing of an apparition.He
took my handshe held them like a dying man.
The power of blood is upon me! said he. I meant
onlywhat was innocentor, at least, I meant not to
be guilty;but I have broken into thy heart, Sarah, and
there is no more sleep for it, on earth.I can never
marry thee.I speak plainly. There is no time for
trifling
;
noI can never marry thee,
never!
But
I love
thee
. I never meant to tell thee this. I fled from thee,
to avoid it.And I tell it now, only to comfort thee, in
thy humiliation and bereavement.'Tis only of late,
that I knew it myself.
Why
, Randolph?yes, Juliet, I had even the
indelicacy
,
shame on me!to ask him
why
he could not
marry
me.
There are two reasons, he answered, gasping for
breath
two:
one only of which I can tell theethe
other must die with me, in all probability.I am a
married man.
O---Juliet!---that was the blow that I wanted!---
that
was it!---I thought that I should never breathe again.
The blood stopped in my temples, all at once; and---
and---and here I am---what say you to the tale?---am I
mad, or not? Is there any comfort; any hope for me?---
May I not pray for death?---Randolph has left me. He
has gone to your neighbourhood.---Why did you ever
leave this city?---He will see you probably---nay---he
has promised to see you.---O, in mercy, write to me.---I
care not what it be; but
write
to me,---if it be only to
say that you abandon me forever!
S. R.
JULIET, IN REPLY.
Come to me, immediately, Sarah;
immediately
, if you
have life enough left; or, if you are so ill that you cannot
come, let me be informed by the return post; and I will
go to you, weak and fearful as I am. You may depend
upon this. Mr. John Omar has left town; or I should
send him to you; and his brother, who is daily expected,
has not yet arrived. Come to me, Sarah! my sister!
and, on your life, do not see Randolph again: I cannot
reason with thee, my dear Sarah,dearer to me than
ever, for thy sorrow and suffering, and penitence.
I
know how to feel for thee
. I can understand it all
all!
thy contrition, horrour and amazement. I shall expect

illness
next to death, shall keep me from thee;but, on

SPENCER RANDOLPH TO SARAH RAMSAY.
New York
.
It is time, my excellent
friend
, that we make some
effort
to recover our self possession. There is only one
way. We must be occupied. Nothing else can save us.
And yet more, we must voluntarily encounter some
shocks....some shivering....some chilliness of the heart;
that we may be the better able to meet, hereafter, by
accident
.
Be the first trial mine. I sit down to write to
you, dear woman, as if nothing had happened---nothing
to interrupt the
friendly
intercourse, in which we
persisted
so long. Let us not think of the past, Sarah;
nor of the future. We must gather up our strength;
and bind up our loins or perseverance and trial.
Passion
,
and the passionate remembrance of the time, that
is gone, are all to be trodden under foot. Are you able
to do this? You are. Am I?yes, Sarah
I am
.
Whatever I set my heart upon, I can do, be it what it
may. My conscience will not sleepit
will
not:and
there is but one way to appease it; a long life of virtue
and self-denial. Mine
cannot be
a long life; but it
shall be
one of virtue; or I will perish, by my own hand.
Mark meI know what I say. I have been nearly
driven to despair, oncenot so much of myself, as of
others. If I ever be again, I will not survive it, for an
hour. I am determined.
You seem to understand that I amnay, we will
not return to the past.
I arrived here yesterday, completely worn out; and,
after a few hours rest, went abroad. I like the place,
very
much. Nay, I have already found a person, who
has been very polite and attentive, to inform me about
your friend Mrs. Grenville. It appears that her
husband
vol. ii. R 2
has gone abroad, for his health; and that
she
is in
a very precarious and delicate state. I imagine that
this
must be the same lady. Was she ever remarkable
for her voice, in singing.
This
lady
was;
and the
gentleman
,
who gave me this information, seems to be one of
the greatest enthusiasts in the world. He says that
there was nothing on this earth like her voice, in a large
room. It was a silver buglefull of thrilling and
incessant
intonationand never exhausted. In a small
room, there was nothing very remarkable in it;for it
lost a great part of its expression and tendernessand
all its touching modulation, then;and, he added, that he
knew many ladies, with a greater knowledge of musick
and two, certainly, who sang, with more passion and
feelingand several, with more brilliancy and science,
in company: but neverand he has heard all the singers
of Europenever, any one, whose tone was so pure,
sweet, powerful and interminable,when properly
brought out, as hers. Is it the same lady?
There is another personbut I must not name his
name to you, I am told. I have great curiosity to see
him. Did I not understand from you, that he was
married
?
Such is my impression. But this gentleman says that
he is an unsocial, ambitious, haughty fellow, who has
been thought a little disordered.
Enclosed, are the other scraps of poetry, which I
promised
to you. It appears that they were written, a long
time since, in the common-place books of certain young

strangely

rich thoughts in them, I confess; yet, I should never
have read them a second time, but for the name of the
author, which I knew was a spell to conjure up the devil
with, in
one
heart at least. What think you of them?
Hath his head been anointed, lawfully; and hath he been
fairly entitled to take his seat among the bards?not,
surely, if these be a fair specimen of his power. Some

POETRY, ENCLOSED TO .
Ah, there is inspiration yet,
In Woman's smile;
But more within her eye, when wet,
And glittering, like some jewel set,
In trembling dew, awhile.
Still more, in lip of bleeding red;
Or forehead, full and high, outspread
Above a drooping lid;
Or in the full, full heartand though?
Transparent, like a spirit, caught
In gauze and vapour hid.
Yetafter all, the loveliest beam
E'er shed below,
By Beauty in her passion-dream,
Is darkness, to the blinding stream
Of frank eyes in their flow.
The next, it is said, was written for a woman, whom I
have seen:and never was poetry so foolishly
mis-applied
:
of this, it would appear that he became, in a
measure, sensible; for, on the next leaf, are written the
subsequent verses, for an atonement. I could see that
she was a very uncommon woman; and such is her
reputation
.
TO .
O Woman! thou'rt a lovely ray;
Shining athwart our pilgrim-way,
All mystery and light!
That, while we turn our eyes to heaven,
To thank it, for the raying given,
Is gone!and we are left in night.
A rainbow thou, of tinted air,
As faint and dim, as if it were,
But painted on the pale blue day,
To keep our thought forever there,
In love, and tenderness, and prayer;
Yetvanishingin tearsaway.
Yea, Womanthou'rt a glittering flower,
Evolving in our hermit-bower,
Weeping and breathing all around thee;
Yetwhile we're stooping to caress thee,
Scorched by the lips of flame, that bless thee,
Art ashes!ere we've fairly found thee!
TO , THE SAME, IN ATONEMENT.
Forgive meI have done thee 'wrong;
Ye are not all that wayward thing;
The misty light of youthful song;
The dust upon an insect-wing.
No, no!a woman
may
endure,
Though she be bright as heaven's own how;
Though glittering, pale, and cold and pure,
As flowrets that in grottos blow.
She
may
outlast the god of day,
And all the stars of evening too;
Burn on, unquenchably, foraye;
Set deep in everlasting blue.
The following, I have been told some pleasant things
about. Of several copies that I have met with, no two are
alike; yet I am assured that this came from his own
hand. To be sure, there is no great merit in it; but I
have obtained it, as corroborative evidence of his
character
;
and think it, for its own sake, worth preserving.
HYMN. SUPPER.
Our Father! we approach thy board,
Like children that would be forgiven:
Remembering him, thy Son, who poured
His blood for all beneath the heaven.
Once more, our Saviour! we arise,
And stretch our hands, to touch thy bread;
And taste the wine, with streaming eyes;
And humble hearts, and faltering tread.
O Thou! whose awful front was bowed,
In thine unspeakable distress,
To God, for uswe call aloud,
On thee, in this our helplessness!
Beseeching thee, our Saviour, still
To be our mediator, where,
The men that died on Calvary's hill,
With thee, are round thy God, in prayer.
WHAT IS AN ALBUM?
Say ye, who know, and have the power,
To tell what ye may know,
What is an Album?'tis a flower
It is the sunbeam in the shower
Of wavering tint like tulip blow;
All ruddy here, with joy and light;
There purpled o'er with sorrow
There crimson, blue and gold unite;
The sunset of the heart!like
night
,
When coloured with the morrow!
With there a spot of trembling paint,
That changes while 'tis gazed on,
An emblem of the heart-complaint
Like midnight fruit that, cold and faint,
Grows ruddy when 'tis blazed on.
And here are tints of silken hue,
All running in together;
Shifting forever in the view,
Like billows in their sea of blue;
Or young Love's nodding feather:
There Genius blazeslike the light,
By constellations given;
And there Stupidity, like night,
Or wind, when watery skies are bright,
Clouds all the fairy heaven!
EXPRESSION.
There are hearts that love the unchangeable dye,
And passionless hue, of a tame blue eye;
And worship a brow that is ever serene,
Like the lifeless sky of a painted scene,
Where the sun-shine sleeps, and the clouds are still;
And motionless gushes the mountain rill:
Such eyes are too steady too patient, too true;
I love not their sleepy, inanimate hue
But give me the glance with the soul in its rays;
The brow that can frown, and the eye that can blaze:
The smile of that brow is forever the lightest,
As a flash from a dark-cloud is ever the brightest:
For onem my dear girl, is the still, bright lake,
That winds cannot ruffle, and storms cannot shake;
The other!the foam of the cataract-dash
The darker the water, the brighter the flash.

Nay, wouldst thou but write, for a moment, for
me
,
How hallowed would be the page!
I'd peruse it forever, still thinking of thee,
While the leaf rolled in light, as evolving to see,
How thy spirit could mine engage:
To mother of pearl, the leaf should turn;
The writing, to jewel-flame;
And rubies and sapphires, together burn,
Where'er thou hadst written thy name:
And, would'st thou remember the days that are flown,
When alone, at night, thou weepest;
While I turned to that page, where 'twas burning alone,
With feeling the purest and deepest:
O, the hours that have gone, like the zephyrs away,
When our spirits were purest and lightest.
Would return with our thought, and around us play,
With pinionsthe quickest and brightest
Then wilt thou not write, but a moment for

Thrice blessed would be the endeavour!

With the page curling bright, as delighted to be,

And the margin should tremble with gold:
An emerald wreath should around it burn;
And blossoms of fire unfold!
Farewell, Sarah, farewell! and let me entreat you to

Altogether better and bolder poetry
.Ed.
I've loved to hear the war-horn cry;
And panted at the drum's deep roll;
And held my breath, when, flaming high,
I've seen our starry banners fly,
As, challenging the haughty sky,
They went, like battle, o'er my soul:
For I was so ambitious then,
I burned to bethe slave of men.
I've stood and seen the morning light
A standard swaying far and free;
And loved it, like the conquering flight
Of angels, floating wide and bright
Above the storm, above the fight
Where nations warred for Liberty;
And thought I heard the battle cry
Of trumpets in the hollow sky:
I've sailed upon the dull blue deep,
And shouted to the eaglet soaring;
And hung me from a rocking steep,
When all but spirits were asleep;
And O, my very soul would leap,
To hear the gallant waters roaring!
For every sound and shape of strife,
To me was but the breath of life:
But, I am strangely altered now;
I love no more the bugle voice
The rushing wavethe plunging prow
The mountain, with his clouded brow
The thunder, when the blue skies bow,
And all the sons of God rejoice
I've learned to dream of tears and sighs,
And shadowy hair, and timid eyes.
JULIET TO SARAH.
Why did you not come on, at once, Sarah? You have
nothing to fear, nothing in the world, I assure you, about
him
. I never see him; and, although he have authority to
visit me, yet he is wise enough never to use it, even on
business, except in the presence of a third person. I
cannot
deny that such delicacy has raised him, a good deal,
in my estimation; nay, my dear Sarah, I will go further,
for I ought, in justice to an injured manI believe that
you wrong him; that I have wronged him; nay, that he
has deserved little of the cruelty and unkindness, which
he has met with, in this world. But that is all. I
cannot
say another word in his favour. Pray, compose

yoursef

dear; and lose not an hour in making good your
promise. I want your company, at this time, more than
that of any living creature, except my husband.----
Come to me, Sarah. We have enough to forgive, and
enough to be forgiven; and we may be happier, in
weeping
together
, than, in this life of apprehension, apart.---
Fear nothing for him---though there be no chance of his
visiting me, without notice; yet, to make that perfectly
sure, I will address a note to him, the moment that you
arrive, requesting him to transact all his business with
me, thereafter, by writing. He will understand me.---
And now, farewell, my dear Sarah---my
sister
---my
friend. Take comfort; and all will be well, yet. We
shall live and be happy, in our compassion for the
infirmities
of each other.
I am much better in spirits to-day, than I have been
for a long while. My husband's vessel has been spoken
withall well, they sayand I feel, almost, as if I
had been pressed to his bosom. And yet, such dreams!
so desolate!so dark!O, Sarah, I shall not be
happy

for an hour, till thou art with me, to cheer up my
widowhood; and help me to sustain the agony that is
approaching

with every blow of the clock.
JULIET.
MOLTON TO STAFFORD.
I hasten to answer the rest of your letter; as I
promised
.
Nowe have no dramatists---no architectsno
sculptors---no musicians---no tragedians. And
why? It is not for want of natural genius. There is
enough of that among my countrymen. It is for the
want of encouragement, riches, a crowded population,
luxury, and corruption. These arts are of the last, to
which a people turn their attention. And when we turn
ours to them, we shall succeed, as we have, in everything
else, to which we have applied our hand, seriously. I
know of more than one man, at this moment, who is capa
ble of writing a great drama. We have many builders, who
have studied architecture, and would excel, if they could
feed themselves and their families upon the cameleon diet,
meanwhile. But we have not even a pretender to
sculpture
.
One Spaniard,
[18]
[18]
NoCapellano is an Italian.
Ed.
(
Capellano
,) a man of great
talent---simple
and severe---and two or three Italians, have
been among us, of considerable merit; but we have no
native Americans. Sig.
Causici
, a pupil of Canova,
starving at Washington, under the bounty of a whole
people, is a man of extraordinary genius; but God
forgive
the men that abuse it. They employed him to make
a colossal statue of Liberty: that is, they authorized him
to make one, probably,
at his own risk
. He made a
stupendous
cast; and was preparing his mind for an
immortal
labour, when he was prevented, by a touch of the
annual
epidemick---economy. But, what did the great
men at Washington? I'll tell you. They watched an
opportunity, when he was away; tore down his
workshop
,
(for the statue was too large to be taken out of the
door;) carried off the plaster model; and elevated it, to a
place of permanent occupation, over the Speaker's head,
in the House of Representatives; where it is yet to be
seen, an everlasting libel on our nation. The artist had
well nigh gone distracted. He told me, himself, that he
would have cut his own throat, but for the hope of being
employed in some work, that would redeem his own
reputation
;
and shame them and their posterity, forever.
He is a fine looking fellow, with large, clear, hazel eyes,
light brown hair, full of fire and energy; and looks far
more like a German, than like an Italian. He came
from Verona. His Baron de Kalb, a little figure about
ten inches high, is the most truly elegant and
vital
piece
of sculpture, that I ever saw. He made it, in consequence
of another
hint
from the nation, only as a model for a
full length statue,
designed
for the Baron, by Congress;
which
design
, ended with the aforesaid hint. He has
more
genius
, by far, than Trentenova, or Capellano; the
latter of whom has more
power
, but is rather a grave and
serious workman---remarkable for a certain majesty of
deportment and cold dignity, in his statuary. As for
musick
, it would be ridiculous for us to think of such a
thing. It is only fit for an idle and dissolute people; and
I never see a man play well upon any instrument, or
hear him sing a good song, without recalling the kingly
rebuke of Philip to Alexander, who had just finished
playing,
divinely
, on a flute.
Are you not ashamed
, said
Philip,
to play so well?
No, Stafford, I feel no histility
to musick; but I would not see any American, any
republican
,
distinguished for it. It is the growth of
corruption
;
the spontaneous issue and yielding of nations in
their decay. Yet, I can relish our sweet, simple, Scotch
and Irish melodies; and when I hear Mrs. French, the
very blood of my heart bubbles, to her incantation, like
a fountain. You have never heard of her, perhaps. She
is an honour to her sex; and though I love her singing,
for its passionate, sweet modulation, in
Down the Burn
Davie, love
, and such old-fashioned airs, yet there are
others who cheer her to idolatry, for her Italian
flourishes
and flings. Stafford, I cannot endure it. I
cannot
bring myself to admire anything, merely for its
difficulty
;
and when I heard Madame Catalini, (whose
shake and trill, by the way, are not a whit better than
Mrs. French's, except in their
occasionally
brilliant and
rapid variety.) though she took my breath away with
her
execution
, yet she never touched my heart. I could
not help thinking of Rousseau's criticism upon the French
musick. The French and the English, said he, are both
ignorant of musick; but the mischief of it is, that the
former will not acknowledge it, and do not
know
it. They
affect to criticise all Europe---and the only notion that
they have of it, is, that it consists in violent transition
and loudness. Thus, she, who can squall the longest and
loudest, is sure to be most applauded at the French
opera
,
no matter how much sympathy she may excite by
her contortions; and, in the orchestra, the only
peculiarity
that I can remember, is, that the whole band run,
one after the other, like so many cows gallopping, or fat
geese learning to flyafter a leader.
Somewhat of a caricature, I confess, Stafford, even
at the time that he wrote in; and I confess, also, that
some of the late French operas have been translated in
Germany and Italy. But what does that prove?---the
vol. ii. S
advance
of the French? I fear not. It may, with equal
probability, prove the
degeneracy
of the German and
Italian school. And this, I am inclined to believe, is the
casefor, it is the nature of refinement, to evaporate, at
a certain elevation. And the artificial beauty; the
exquisite
delicacies and difficulties of their musick, have
been continually approximating to that point, for the
last fifty years. A man must be a professor, to relish
some of their commonest, and simplest productions. But,
play one of their learned, or brilliant ones, to a
congregation
of Americans; and they would think the
performers
madmad as march hares. To their ears, it is the
crash of broken glass; and the wailing of bruised
animal
.
How different is it, with our simple Scotch
melodies
!
I have seen a Choctaw Chief shed tears at Bonny
Doonbut that was before it had been manufactured
into
a duett; and bespattered with Italian touches. I hate
these gew-gaws, and this splendid rubbish; and, though I
recommend the practice of Italian, for the same reason that
I would bid a man, that had to carry a certain weight of
armour continually, to practise, now and then, in a
heavier
suit, leaping and wrestling in ityet, my
reason
would be, not that he should spend his life in
leaping
and wrestling; but that he might be more at his ease,
more graceful and dignified, in the armour that was
made for him.
And when I see a sweet girl, with lips just thrilling,
as if a live coal, from Apollo's own altar had touched
them, and a heart gushing out with melody; when I see her
mingling the
graces
of the Italian, with the dear Scotch,
and Irish minstrelsymy fingers itch to be at her. I
pity her; her nature is abused; and her heart is
corrupted
as
much, as if she wore paint and patches, and the
false jewelry of an Italian opera girl. But why does
she this?why?who are her masters?
That
will
explain
the mystery. They are either Frenchmen or
Germans
;
full of passion, real or affected, for the Italian
school; or Italians themselves; all of whom mock at,
and scorn, as with something of a constitutional, and
political
,
hatred and derision, the sweet simplicity of our
only national musicknay, not musick,
melody
.It is
not even harmony. As a matter of
art
, these teachers
are right. There is no science in these melodies. But
who was ever touched, to the core of his heart, by
science?
There are some things, such as eloquence, poetry, and
singing, where science is detestible. I want not to be
dazzled
nor astonished, at all times. I ask only to be moved,
agitatedto delirium, if you please; and
science
can
never
do thatit is like the flourish of a white
pocket-handkerchief
,
in a speaker, to apprise you, seasonably,
of his design to be pathetick. NoNature is direct.
Her eloquence is of the bloodthe crowded skythe
thought breaks upon you, clap after clap, till your whole
nature is disordered. Call up a mother, who has just
lost her infantbid her tell the storylook at her
study
her. There is no wearying preparation. She repeats
the same thing, over and over again, a hundred times.
There is no poetry; no play of the imagination, in what
she says. There is not even the simplest observance
of ruleher sentences are shortbrokenexclamatory
familiar---colloquialvulgar, it may be, and
ungrammatical
.
But your tears follow---and your heart heaves to
it. Can you improve it? Take it home---dress it up
into an oration---dramatize itand lo! the essence, that
volatile and penetrating spirit, which, from the broken
hearted mother, set all your arteries weeping, that has
escaped
!
Nay, go to the blacksmith, at his anvil; the
farmer
at his plough; put him upon his trade. He is
forcible
and direct. Has he been wronged? mark his
gesture---his
eyes---his hands---the variation of its
countenance
and voice.
That
man is eloquent. For, what is
eloquence? It is the power of convincing. And he,
only
,
is truly eloquent, who can
convince
, right or wrong.
Captivation is another thing---a fool may captivate; but
it takes a giant to convince. But more of this, by and
by, when I come to speak of our orators.
Just so, it is with musick. I cannot endure what is
artificial in it. I love only what is natural. But what is
natural? That were difficult to tell. It is what is
simple
,
continued, and gentle. Such are the notes of a bird.
Certain notes are continually recurring. At any rate,
if I may not define what
is
natural, I can easily tell
what is not. The Italian musick is
not
. It is the very
definition of what is
not
.
Our NOVELISTSYou have frequently spoken of them,
with emphasis. We have no such thing with us.I
know not why it is; but the trade of novel writing has
been of late, as if by common consent, relinquished by
men of genius and power, to women and children; and
if, now and then, a tolerable affair comes out, like these
late Scotch novels, all the world seems to run mad after
it.It is surely not well considered, this thing. Is
it Stafford? There is no class of literature, which may
be made to have; nay which
has
, in reality, such an
influence
upon
society;and, if a man, who had the
strength and vividness, of a dramatist, and a poet, were
called upon to reflect and to choose, that mode of
writing
,
which would be most likely, if he were truly
powerful, to give him the widest theatre for a display of
that power, it is my deliberate opinion that he would
choose a
novel;
and yet, in whose hands do we find this
body of our literature?In the feeble of heartand the
faint of spirit-the gossipping and childish. Now and then,
it is true, a Godwin will break the seals, and invoke the
genii to ascend; but it is with an uncertain aim; and
as if he were not proud of the office. So too, there is a
Maturinhe might do well; but he is haunted by the
spirit of Byron, and the devil himself, at the same time.
Such men are out of their elementnovels might be
made, yet, full of distinctness; full of reality, yet
carrying
the marvellous in every page.
But in our country, there is every thing to discourage
a novelistnothing to incite him. The very name of
having written a novelalthough the wise and
reflecting
acknowledge, that no literature hath such an
influence
upon our language, and mannersnone such
fascination
,for,
in its witchery, it surpasses the stage
and is read, secretly, by them that read nothing else
and them that are not permitted to visit the theatreand
none so wants to be purged and purifiedyet the very
name of a novel writer would be a perpetual reproach
to a man of genius.Would that some one would arise!
and laugh to scorn, the presumption and folly, of this doc
trineand trample it under his feet! What is to
prevent
him, even in America? We have no old castles
no bandittino shadow of a thousand years to penetrate
but what of that. We have men, and women
creatures
that God himself hath fashioned and filled with
character. And what more do we want? By heaven,
Stafford, if I had the power, I would, myself, set
about the work, before I slept:I would take up
the tale, with the events of this very dayand I
would dare to say, to them that, questioned me.Lo!
here is a proof, that we want no traditionsno
antiquity
nothing
but tolerable power, to tell you a tale
that shall thrill to your marrowand that too, without
borrowing from anybody, or imitating anybody.You
laugh at my enthusiasm. I am sure of it. But why
need we go back to the past for our heroes?There
is no such necessity; and he who shall first dare to
grapple with the
present
, will triumph, in this
country
.
Remember, my prediction.
Another very serious reason why, whatever were
the merit of our writers, we could not enter into
competition with the men of Europe is, that we cannot
afford to write for nothing; and yet, if we would
write for nothing; and
give
the copy right of a novel,
for instance, to a publisher, it would still be a
perilous
adventure to him. Shall I tell you the reason?
Our booksellers here can publish your costliest
poems
,
and novels, and dramas, without any expense for
the copy-right. You give Byron or Moore five
thousand
guineas
[19]
[19]
Five thousand guineas!fudge!
Ed.
for a poem; and, in forty days, there
will be an American edition published here, for the
copy
right of which, our publishers have not given a
cent. Names will sell anything. We all know that.
Here is a poem, for example, of Walter Scott, for sale
in Philadelphia, at this moment, called
Hallidon Hill
,
which, I venture to say, has not been read, by twenty
people in the city. And yet, the time was, when the
man who should have predicted such a thing, would
have been hooted at for a fool, or a madman. Then,
Walter Scott was, the greatest poet in the world.
vol. ii. S 2
Now, he is not thought of, as a
poet
. Then, he had a
namenow, he has no name at allas a poet. The
consequence, you will perceive, of this practice in our
country, is, that, until the authors, or publishers of
European
works, have the wisdom to take out copy-rights
in this country, their reputation will be at our mercy;
they will be subject to all sorts of bookselling piracy
and trick; they will get nothing of the vast profit,
that is obtained here, by the sale of their works; and
our native authors cannot contend with them for a
day; because, it is more profitable for a bookseller, in
America, to re-publish established works, of established
authors, when the publick in England have already
past judgment upon them, and there is therefore no
risk in re-publishing them here, than to publish
native
works
, though they be made a present of the
copy-right
.
But will this last forever? No. The time is
rapidly
approaching, when, it will be enough to sell a work, if
it be called American. We are getting to feel a
national
pride; and men are already beginning to put in their
title
pages,
by an American
and
an American Tale
words, that, a few years ago, would have been as
politick, as by a Choctawor
or a Narraganset tale
.
You have heard of Charles Brockden Brown. Your
reviewers, two or three years ago, took into their
heads to call him a great novelist. He deserves the
name. Yet we, his countrymen, never knew it. He
lived and died in obscurity. His works, which
amounted
to about ten or a dozen volumes, are not to be
found in America; or, rather American editions of
them are not to be found. In every publick library, to
be sure. London editions are to be had. Whenever his
name is mentioned here, at this time, you hear it
accompanied
with some proud epithet; and yet, he is
literally
unknown to us. Few, even of our literary men
have read him; although our North American Review,
very gallantly, undertook his resuscitationbut how?
feebly enoughand when?---not till he had
undergone
an apotheosis, at London. There is our
courage
.
A native author, over whose grave we have been
walking for twenty years, without any emotion, has
been dug up, and embalmed abroad---and lo, we have
to go to another people even yet, to understand who,
or what he was. We call him great, not because we
have read him---not because he
was
great; but, because
foreign Reviewers have called him so.---Oh, we are a
base and treacherous peoplebase to the reputation of
our fathers; and treacherous to the inheritance of our
children. We suffer all men to dictate usin that
empire
,
where God never meant man to be dictated to,in
the empire of genius.
Shall I give you my notion of Brown? I will. But
first, let me inform you, that he wrote piece-meal, for
the periodical papers of the day; and that, his tales
were often issued, one volume at a time, by different
publishers; so that you can find an interval of several
years between the first and second volume of some.
Brown was too much addicted to Godwin. That
was the greatest fault. But he was altogether
superiour
to Godwin, in the appaling distinctness of that
manner
,
by which he made very trifling incidents of
importance
enough to occupy your whole heart and soul, for
many pages. Like Godwin, he sought to make you
think with himaccompany himat every step. He
was not content with telling a story to an audiencehe
acted
it. His novels are not so much narratives, as they
are dramaslong, continued soliloquies, which you are
made to overhear, in your participation. He is
daringly
improbable; and continually forgetful of what is past.
Events occur without any order or designhe affects to
explain them, and yet he leaves you, as in Wieland, with
a feeble, teasing dissatisfaction at your heart, as if you
had been listening to one that could not get himself out of a
scrape, except by affronting your good sense, or by
remaining
obstinately silent. This might be well, if there
were any dignity about the feeling; but there is not.
It is not a yearning to know, what is to become of such
and such a character; or how such an incident took place;
but merely a kind of self reproach, that you have been
held in thraldom so long, with so little art. Occasionally
too, a simple incident, will occur so frequently, and be
made so much of, as to excite a suspicion of its reality.
Thus, in Clara Howard, I believe; and in Ormond; and in
Edgar Huntly, there is the same bill of exchange and
misapplication
of money, with much the same reflections.
The incident is too
natural;
and the pertinacity of the
author
suspicious. It not only leads one to doubt his
invention
,
but to believe that, some such incident must have
happened to himself, in reality; for men are apt to make
their own calamities, a little more conspicuous, than
they ought to be. I could mention some other faults of
the same kind; but it gives me more pleasure to think
of his excellencies; contrary to my general rule, which is,
to look for the bad in what is good; and, for the good,
in what is badfor faults, in the work of a master; and
for beauties, in the labour of inferiour genius. My first
canon in criticism, is to discover, if I can, what was the
object
of the artist. Till I have discovered that, I am
dumb. If he have done what he attempted, he must be
praised, whatever were his attempt. We may dislike
his taste; condemn his judgment; but, we cannot pretend
to say, that he has not thatwhich, of itself, is greatness
the power to do what he undertakes. It is hard to
condemn a man for not doing, what be never attempted.
By this canon, let us try Brown. He attempts only
to agitate, for a time. He succeeds. He has no poetry
in his heartor, at least, nothing that the world mistake
for poetry, the beautiful and pathetick:the tender or
dazzling: but he is altogether compounded of the distinct
and earnest; the expressive and terrible in morals. He
is never humorousnever rhetoricalnever splendid;
he never attempts the descriptive, except it be the
descriptive
in passion, which he shows, rather by its effect;
and in its meditation, than by any detail. He is
generally
mild, and thoughtful; or profound, and direct; but,
often very sedate, and very dull. Extraordinary things
occur continually, for no other purpose, it would seem,
than that the author might make his hero meditate aloud,
for a time, upon the mystery:and this propensity
Brown was undoubtedly led into, by his love of Godwin
and his Caleb Williams; but he forgot that, throughout
that admirable novel, there is a continuity of design,
which will not permit you to doubt the scope of any
incident
,
however trivial. What Brown might have been,
but for Godwin, it were easy to say. He would have been
only a narrator of marvellous tales, chiefly remarkable for
plain, direct management, and a tone of serious
conviction
,
as if he believed what he was saying. What he would
have been, after having his mind imbued with the dark,
and beautiful waywardness of Godwin, whose faculty
of making trifles momentous and tragical; and
improbabilities
probable, was never equalled by any other
man, if he had not yielded himself too unreservedly, in
his admiration of him; and become an imitator in all his
forcible works, it would have been no difficult matter to
foretel. He would have been one of the few great novel
writers
that the world has ever seen. No one would have had a
more distinct and formidable character. No one would
have dealt more unqualifiedly, or more unsparingly, with
the terrible and the dramatick. As it isCharles
Brockden
Brown does not deserve his present reputation.
His
Clara Howard
and
Jane Talbot
are paltry tales,
distinguishable only from the mass of such productions,
by a more thoughtful tone, and heavier probability. His
Edgar Huntly
is a tissue of agitating adventures, put
together in patch work, with amazing talent at times;
and, again, at other times, with a slovenly and shameful
indifference. His
Ormond
, or the
Secret Witness
,
does not correspond at all with the title. One would
believe
that he had written the work, without having once
thought of title; and that, then, he had put in a little note
containing the only incident, where anything like a
Secret Witness may be found, merely as a kind of
justification
for the title. His
Arthur Mervyn
and
Wieland
have some awful features in thembut they are
frightfully indistinct; and his principal character is
always
the same---always Carwin---always an
adventurer---and
always doing what you cannot expect. Thus,
the hero of Arthur Mervyn, we are led to believe at one
time, will prove to have been the schoolmaster, who many
years before, had destroyed Arthur's own sister. There
cannot be the least doubt, that it was the intention of
Brown to follow up the hint, at the time; but he forgot it,
when he took up the tale again; and has left us to complain
of his having invaded the unity of his own design,
and
forgotten his own purpose
, in a very childish manner.
But let me forbear. You perhaps have heard of the
Spy
. There is another imitator. The author has
fallen
so much into the manner of the Scot, that, if there
were some good tedious Scotch dialogue in it, few
people
would he able to detect the counterfeit. It is a very
good novel; but they are making such a fuss about it
here, that we shall become ridiculous abroad, when they
come to read it, where the Scotch
Pedlar
, in the
Antiquary
(the original of the
Spy
,) has been before. The Spy,
like the
Pedlar
, is omnipresent; always appearing when
not expectednor wanted. Some parts are capitalthe
death of the Skinnerthe character of the Irish woman;
some of her dialogue; the escape of Wharton, after he
gets into the saddle:and some points in the men of
Virginia
.
But, as in the Waverly writer, there is a
distressing
barrenness of invention; and no poetry at all. The
two principal characters escape from death, by a similar
expedient; one, in the disguise of an old woman; and the
other in that of a
negro;
and that too, from the centre of
an armed camp, with watchful sentinels all about.
Whenever the author is in a scrape, too, he sets fire to
the chief mansion houseor introduces General
Washington
as
if, just on the point of doing some very
foolish
thingand deterred from it, page after page, by some
impertinent trick of authorship, to prolong the tale, and
protract the catastrophe; just as if his manuscript had
fallen short of his contract with the printerand then:
too, WashingtonGeorge Washington is profanely
introduced
;
and always profanely employed, in situations
totally unworthy of himperilousfoolishand
ridiculously
mysterious;and the Spy is made to outlive the
timesand fight and die in the war of 1812which was
another after thought.
Every thing is done for effect. Some fine incidents
occur; but they are too often clap traps, stage incidents.
A woman, for example, is shot through the heartand
dies, the Lord knows why. It does not help the
catastrophe
,
except that it lightens the obligation of the
author
,
who has no talent in the pathetick, or passionate,
though a good deal in the humorous, and an
uncommonly
fine one, in the descriptivenot of the human
heart, but of natureand the individual thingsof
nature
.
The
Spy
too, when hunted for his life, is made
to fire at people, and then throw away his gun, merely to
terrify them: to sit upon a rock, and eat chinquipin berries
within pistol shot, almost, of his mortal enemiesto talk
wildly about his father, without telling us why, although
great interest is excitedand we are made to expect an
important result; and finally, to destroy a protection
given
to him by Washington, at the very moment when it was
to be usedaye, when that case of mortal emergency
had arrived, which was the
only
object of the protection,
where nothing else could save himthe
Spy
merely that
he might utter a few mysterious words, and make a stage
flourish, pulled it out of his pocket, and swallowed it.
Such tricks are contemptible. The author, I hope,
will never repeat them. He has good talent, as I have
already saidbut he must not believe what the people
tell him of it. It is not a
great
talentand never will be.
He wants originalitypassionpoetryand eloquence.
His
Precaution
, the first of his novels, no mortal,
but a critick, could get through with. It is a tedious,
intertangled
,
boarding school tale. His
Pioneers
(by the
way, I would have you remark the order of these
productions
Precaution
the
Spy
the
Pioneers
and the
Pilot
one would believe that he meant to
lead
his
countrymen into an enemy's territory,) which is just
abroad, has disappointed the sensible and thinking
people prodigiously. The first volume is mere stuff
laboriously beaten out; but the second is very good.
Most of the characters of the Spy are repeated. And some,
under the same names. Sergeant Hallester and wife,
for instance;--and then, there is the same old maid; and the
yankee, from Connecticut, in bothand the same negro
in both:and one character taken from Brace-Bridge
Hall (I mean the character, if it may be called one, of
Mr. Jones, who is the identical bachelor of Irving,) and
another compounded from Rip Van Winkle, and the
vagabond
itinerant; the former of which Irving, himself,
borrowed, or stole from an old German tale, which I
remember
.
There is a battle too, surprisingly after the
fashion of Irving in Knickerbocker, to avoid bloodshed.
There is a Frenchman, however, in the
Pioneers
, who
talks not only broken English, but broken French
enough, to convince you that the author is not at all
familiar
with the French; and a Sailor, whose character
is well supported; but whose language is a compilation
of sea phrases;and both appear to have been made up,
without understanding their application, from some
wretched vocabulary. Elizabeth is a foolMiss Grant,
who was meant to be the heroine, is
let alone
, at last, in
a laughable, author-like way, as if she were forgotten.
But there are some capital things in it--capital. The fire
on the mountain, which, to be sure, is too exceedingly
like the sea-shore escape in the Antiquarywhere, for
the Beggar, we are to read the Indian
Leatherstocking
;the
death of the catamount---the shad fishery, (too
like the whale-killing in the Pirate, though)and the
christmas shooting, which is faithful and masterlyand
the stag huntare equal to any thing in the history of
novel writing, for vivid description. They are, to be
sure, not overpoweringbut they are very distinct; and
even sublime, circumstantial, and terrible, now and then.
But the best joke, after all, isand I will put my
reputation
on the fact (being anonymous!) that the
Wilderness
,
a Tale of
Braddock's Times
, is another novel by
the author of the
Spy
and
Pioneers
. I have heard
nobody
say so. I have never heard it conjectured
but I
am sure of it
. The style is the samethe chief
incidents
the same (the death of the catamount and the
death of the Indian, after the Rhoderick Dhu school
and the extracting of a ball, two or three times,
are the same)the character the samean Irishman,
who talks tolerable Irishanother, who talks just about
as much like a Scot, as the sailor does,
like
a sailor, in
the Pioneers; and a Frenchman, who talks anything but
French. How pleasant it is. Mr. Walsh, I dare say,
has never read the
Wilderness
or, if he have read it,
has thought it, what it is, a paltry taleutterly destitute
of merit,and yet, had the title page borne the legend,
By the author of the Spy
, he would have thought
it, no doubt, quite an honour to the country. I say first,
that it isby the author of the Spy. I care not who
contradicts me; and I say secondly, that it is better than
Precaution
and as good as nine tenths of the
Spy
and
the Pioneers
and in style, precisely the same. So
much for a name.
On the whole, however, I am afraid that the author
has done himself up; and I feel sure that, if his
Pilot
be
not worth a dozen of the
Pioneers
and
Spy
, that he will
be overhaled with claws of iron, by his warmest
admirers
.
At present, they expect too much. Of course,
they must be disappointed.
But the most amusing part is yet to come. I have
heard two of these very works attributed to the author of
Niagara, Goldau, and Otho, of whom I have already
spoken
:
nay, I have heard a man say, that he
knew
him to be
the author of the
Spy
. I smiled; because, if I understand
that writer's character, he could not have written either
of them;and if his pride and vanity be, what they are
said to be, he would never have published them, if he
had written them; he would consider them as altogether
beneath him. And this reminds me of another report,
which, I confess, to be far more probable, that he is the
author of
Logan
and
Seventy-six
, of which I have
already
given you my hasty opinion. They have been
ascribed to several; but to no one, so generally, or with
such pertinacity, as to him. But are they his? Let us
examine the evidence. It is conceded that they are
both the production of the same person, not so much
from any unequivocal internal evidence, as from the fact,
that the author of
Seventy-six
avows himself to be the
author of
Logan
.
The reasons that I have heard assigned, in proof that
he is the author, are, chiefly, the following:First, the
style:secondly, the incidents:thirdly, the general
opinion of the publick:----and, fourthly, the fact that he
does not
deny
the authorship.
And first, for the style. I admit that the style of this
author is very remarkable. And yet, how varied it is.
In the length of twenty pages, you will find a variety of
different styles; now argumentative, and now
declamatory
;now
vol.ii. T
broken and abrupt, and now, mild,
temperate
,
and well sustained. For myself, I cannot deny,
that I like his writing, with all its passion, vehemence,
brokenness and extravagance; because, I have
persuaded
myself, that he, who agitates me, must himself be
agitated. But grant, if you will, that his style is very
remarkable, and very faulty. Is it not,
for that very
reason, the more easily imitated?
Great peculiarities are
easily counterfeited. Lord ByronDr. JohnsonM.
G. Lewis have been successfully imitated. The
profoundest
men of the timecritickswere deceived by
Irelands' imitations of Shakspeare. And Bonaparte
confessed, that a spurious work, purporting to be
written by himself, was so amazingly like him, that
it might not only deceive others; but, that there were
passages capable of deceiving himself. I can readily
believe this. I would undertake to imitate the style
of any man, if he be at all remarkable, in prose or
poetry
,
so as to deceive any critick. And this, if you
please, my dear Stafford, does not imply any
equality;
but rather a little ingenuity in the imitator. He has
but to seize on the peculiarities of the writer, and
obtrude
them, continually, in as adroit a manner as he
can, to be sure, upon the reader. There never was a
greater blockhead than he, who, for a time palmed off
certain minor poems upon your publick, and ours, for
the poetry of Byron.The
Farewell to England
is one
of the number, I believe, that yet passes for a genuine
Byron. I do not distinctly recollect, but I believe that
that
is one of several, which passed for Byron's, from
the first, and which were avowed by the author, who
was an Englishman, in his preface to a volume of
wretched stuff that he published in Philadelphia, a year
or two ago.
Is it safe then, to depend so confidently upon style;
particularly where that style is remarkable, chiefly
for peculiarities, that are so very easily imitated, as
abruptnessboldness and arrogance. As we grow
older
,
do we not become more distrustful of all
evidence
?
Do we not learn that, to
copy
is one thing; and
to
imitate
, another; and that, even
copies
, in painting for
example, are not infallibly known; and that imitations,
by a tolerable artist, of a great master, are far more
difficult to detect; and may pass through the whole
world for original. How long, for instance, has the
world gone on ascribing the
Venus de Medicis
to
Praxitiles
,and
yet, we are now beginning to believe that
it is not hisand that, all the sculpture, within our
reach, is but the workmanship of a degenerate age.
Style and manner then, are not to be depended upon,
so implicitly, as they would seem to be, at the first glance.
Men are unequal. Men of genius are particularly so:
consequently, they are more easily imitatedand their
imitations are more difficult to detect. The author of
Niagara and Otho is, certainly, a man of genius. That
will not be denied. Every page is full of inequality,
confusion, and darkness. It is easy to be unequal,
confused and dark. Logan is remarkably so.I can
take passage after passage from Logan; and compare
them together, before your eyes; and you will perceive
that they are as unlike each other, as any two things
that were ever written. At most, therefore, if you depend
upon
style
, you will be driven to admit that all of
Logan
,
and Seventy-six
cannot
have been written by the
same personnor by the author of Goldau, and Otho;
and Niagara.
But let me come to facts. I can refer to several
articles
in Blackwood's Magazine; and to several in the
Monthly Magazine; altogether in a similar style, and
particularly to one in the latter, respecting
hypochondria
,
from the use of opium, which appeared
simultaneously
with Logan, thatif we might depend upon style,
and even
thought
, one might swear was written by the same
man; nay, I have heard it almost sworn to, by an
acute critick, and an intimate friend of Mr.
Neal
.
And yetI have good reason to believe that Mr. N.
is not the author of any one of them.
Well thenwe cannot
depend
upon similarity of style.
It proves too much. It is only a circumstance; but, as
a circumstance, entitled to great consideration, I
admit
.
The next question iswhether we can depend upon
the incidents. Many of them are said to be incidents
of his own life:and the people who know him, pretend
to find in it, his own wayward and adventurous
journeying, shadowed throughout. Who can believe
this? What would be more ridiculous? Yet nothing
is more common. I have been gravely informed that
the character of
Echo
in
Keep Cool
, is a faithful
portrait
of the author; and seriously assured by one, who
knew all
the parties well, that
all
the characters were
real;
and that
Earnest
, in the same novel, was drawn by
the author, for himself!
I would ask what are the incidents in Logan? are
they very remarkable? are they known? Certainly
they must be
known
, or who could recognize them in
a novel? Is the author a fool or a madman?
The
world are divided in their opinion, perhaps
. There
are many, it is true, who believe him to be both; but
I am not of that number. These incidents are
known
there can be no doubt of it; and they must be
remarkable
,
or nobody would remember them:
consequently
,
they are the legitimate property of the
publick
,
and subject to the appropriation of any
novel-writer
,
whatever.I have heard a good deal of them;
and if they be true, it would be rather difficult, I think,
for any man to persuade the world, that an author
would so far publish his own shame; or so foolishly
imitate the notorious Byron, who is always the hero
of his own tale, as the world are charitable enough
to believeor to declare, whether they believe it, or
not: and last of all, an author so ridiculously
extravagant
as Mr. Neal, in his love of originality.
But remarkable as the incidents in question are
I am told of two
facts
, that go a good way to
destroy
my confidence in their testimony.
The first is, that, when Lady Morgan's Florence
McCarthy appeared, I am assured, that the friends of
this very Mr. Neal, found his portrait, in the ridiculous
coxcomb,
De Vere
. I believe this; because I have
been told so, by two literary men, who were in habits of
intimacy with him. And they both spoke of it, as a
portrait
. One extraordinary coincidence certainly does
appear in that character.
De Vere
, very
unnecessarily
,
is made to mention his birth day.Who ever thought
of such a thing. It was the twenty-fifth of August.---
It is odd enough that Mr. Neal was born on that very
day. De Vere, you know, was a bad drawing of Lord
Byron. So too was
Glenarvon
, which, by the way,
in America, has been charged to Mr. N. as one of his
productions,---beside being admitted by many, to
contain
a portrait of him, in the character of the scoundrel,
who is the hero.
But the best of all is---that, about the time when, it is
alleged, that certain transactions occurred in his life,
which, for his own sake, he should have been discreet
enough, if they have not been misrepresented to me, to
keep forever concealed; there was a novela pious, dull
thingwith some very fine parts in it, called No
Fiction
which
made its appearance; narrating, with an
accuracy, almost too astonishing for belief, if it were
accidental, merely, the very same incidents, which are
the ground, on which he is charged with the
authorship
of
Logan
. And yetthat was accidental, I
verily
believe. In fact, it must have been sounless he
were the author; or knew of its publication, at least;
for, it appeared in London
before
the transactions
occurred
in America, which are so exceedingly like a part,
that are related in the book.
Can we depend nowupon these incidentsor
resemblances
of character? More remarkable ones have
occurred
,
we see, where there can be no doubt of their
having been accidental.
But, it is not even necessary to suppose that they
were accidental. If I am rightly informed, Mr. N. who
is really thought to be a downright madman, with an
occasional lucid interval, by many people in the city
where he is livinghas made no secret of them.
He has spoken and written freely of them, but not
ostentatiously
,
if I may judge by one of his letters, which I
have seen. What would have been easier, therefore, than,
for another person to introduce them; and colour and
exaggerate them; and thenfor nothing is more
common
,
vol. ii. T 2
to circulate a report that they were not
altogether
imaginary
, merely to give the work a run: for, we all
know, that the obscurity or insignificance, of the
unfortunate
or wayward, are not always an antidote to the
publick appetite for the exciting and uncommon.
So far then, we have gone into the examination of
the two chief witnesses. Give them all their weight;
and, to what do they amount? The
style
is equivocal;
and the
incidents
publick property; and the
coincidences
,
not so remarkable, as others that
were not
, and
could not
have been
, other than accidental.
Let us now look at the publick opinion. Can we
depend upon that? No. The longer we live, the more
doubtful we become of our own judgment, in matters of
mere taste. Of what weight then, should be the
judgment
of the mob? I
know
that they have ascribed
many
things to people, that never wrote them. I have
reason
to believethat Mr. N. has had volumes attributed
to him, that he never saw; and that much of
his
writing
has been attributed to other men. So it is, with
all authors. Of my own knowledge, I
know
that he is
not the author of one work, that has been ascribed to
him; and that he
is
the author of one more, that is
ascribed
to another man. This, I happen to
know
.
But why does'nt he deny it! say the world. That
were very easy, one would think. But, without
seeking
to account for
his
not denying it; I can readily
give many reasons, why any man might not deny it.
In the first place, in a country like ours, where there
are so few authors, and they universally known; it is
common to ascribe any new publication, in the
newspapers
of the day, to one or the other, immediately, on
its appearance. In this way, if each take the trouble
to deny the authorship, he soon reduces the real
author
to the necessity of standing alone. A man might
regard the work so attributed to him, as beneath his
genius; and then, if he were really a man, he would
disdain to contradict a report, that would more
naturally
perish of itself, than by any attempt of his, to
destroy
it: or, he might think it an honour to him; and, if
a vain man, or a mischievous one,or one that was
willing to promote the concealment of the author, he
would never deny it. Orhe might really know the
authorhave contributed, perhaps, a very little to the
workor written the preface(as I have known to be
done, in Allen's Revolution)or corrected the proofs.
On either of which suppositions,
he
would be held to
such a course, as would best avoid publick remark or
inquirypublick newspaper speculation;for,---when
the
friend
is knownor the corrector of the pressor
the writer of the preface, it is no very difficult matter
to find the author. The difficulty of concealment
then
would be immeasurably augmented. Conjecture would
amount to certainty. But there is yet another reason,
why a man might refrain from denying the authorship
of any work. By continually denying whatever was
wrongly ascribed to him, he would put it out of his
power
ever to write anonymously; for, if he should refuse to
deny
anything, no matter what; to no matter what
impertinent
questioner---he would be immediately
established
, as
the author: and all would refer for
proof
to the fact of his
uniform denial before, on like occasions. So much for
the fact that he does not deny the authorship.
[20]
[20]
And what if he really
had
something to do with the works,or were bound to secrecy;
or had an interest in them,or were employed, as
I am
, to superintend the printing
would he not be silent?
Ed
.
But are there not other facts going, indirectly to be
sure, but very strongly, to prove that he is not the
author
?
He abandoned poetry some years ago; and,
notwithstanding
every temptation, has never written any
since.That would argue some self denial. He is
very
ambitious, I am told; and established, in a lucrative,
and respectable practice: is very remarkable for his
diligent attention to the
science
and philosophy of Law
and an indefatigable student. If this be true; and
I believe that it is; it is hardly reconcileable with the
character of a rash and headlong novel writer, which the
author of Logan and Seventy-six, most unquestionably
deserves.
Stay----I have lately heard something, which I can
depend on. Some publick paper once declared that he
was
the author of Logan, Seventy-six, and some others.
I am told, that he laughed when he saw it---and said
that no human being lived, who
knew
him to be the
author
of any work that he had not avowed, publickly, and
unhesitatingly. And the best of all is, that, while his
friends are seriously alarmed about the matter, and
anxious to vindicate his reputation from the charge of
authorship
,
he gives himself no kind of trouble about the
matter; and, I am told, thinks very highly of the works
themselves!
I have made a tremendous letter to be sure, dear
Stafford
;
it is almost a book; but when I get upon a
temperate
and agreeable theme, it soothes my blood, and
alleviates
the unpleasant throbbing of my arteries; and I love
to dwell upon it.
Perhaps a word or two more, on the character of these
novels, may not be amiss. The first is no novel. It is
a wild, fiery, protracted dream--a tale--not, perhaps
told
by an ideot
, not signifying absolutely nothing---but,
full of sound and fury
. It would seem rather a vehicle
for the peculiar and daring opinions of the author, than,
any connected, and intentional development, of a
preconceived
design. It is a great void, peopled with
phantoms
.
And when the author wants to terrify you; or
provoke you, by any startling paradox, or a discharge
of sky rockets, he
makes
the occasion, heedless of all
consequences
.
The whole book is full of darkness,
repetition
,
anachronism and extravagance. Nobody can read
it through, deliberately, as novels are to be read. You
feel fagged and fretted to death, long and long before
you foresee the termination. It is not dull---nor common
place; but it is too exciting. The author won't let you
cool off, for a moment, in your ascent. He has you,
forever
,
under whip and spur. We can live, year after year,
you know, on bead and water---in literatureas in diet;
but we should soon starve upon sweetmeats and cayenne
pepper. High seasoned dishes are disagreeable, after
a little time, to the jaded appetite. So, with the aliment
of the mind. So with Logan. There is material enough;
and spice and fire enough in it, for fifty volumes, such
as the populace are fond of. The author appears to have
written, only, while the fit was upon him; and always to
have forgotten, what he had already done; and, finally,
to have collected all the loose and flying fragments, and
tacked them together, any howto make a book. To
my view, it is rather a great, troubled poem, than a
noveland rather a common place book than either.
It is a world in confusion, where, to borrow one of his
own thoughts, the fountains of the human heart are
broken
up, like the fountains of the great deep; where
reptiles
are crawling about, over gold and coral;and
seagems
and skeletons are all jumbled together.
It is a torrent, that comes down upon you
thundering
through the mountainsstained with subterranean
ore; and encumbered with the wreck and ravage of a
deluged
empire.
His
Seventy-six
, however, saving some laughable
blunders, in the way of authorship, is altogether
superiour
as a novel. But I have no leisure to criticise that,
now. The first tale is told by an Indian, (a descendant
of
Logan
,)the second by an old
revolutionary soldier
,
who gives fair notice, that he shall
write
just as he
pleases. Perhaps this fact may account for their
incoherency
;
and for an appearance, which I can only
explain
,
by saying thatbecause people, in
conversation
,
do not always finish their sentences, this writer does not;
and that, many pages look, as if they had been
written
,
without points, and without thoughtand then pointed,
by a blind man, as well as they could be, at hap-hazard.
Good night
.
Sunday morning
.
Nobody to trouble me, this morning, dear Stafford, so
that, without recurring to our novels, which I am
heartily
tired of, I have some hope of being able to scribble
awhile longer upon our national literature.
Ohthe editor of the Galaxy. I had forgotten him,
again. His name is Buckingham. He is a strong
minded
man; very honest, very sincere, and very obstinate.---
You are mistaken about his hostility to your
countrymen
.
He makes battle only with such of you, as are
eternally growling, like your own bull-dogs, at
everything
American; and with the runaway English, who come
here to abuse us, and snarl at us, and pick our pockets.
He is a man of no educationwas, for a short time, an
humble performer upon an humble provincial theatre
then, a printerand is now, editor and printer of a paper,
that, if he stick to it, as I think he will, must be a fortune
to him. He is a bold writersometimes an eloquent one;
a good reasonerbut too fond of going all lengths, when
not required; but
he
, even
he
, is not a man of a genuine,
natural, inward love or relish, for poetry. He might
have been, (as the editor of the Charleston Courier
is
,)
but it is too late now. He is a thousand times more than
he would believe, under the influence of education. The
finest thing in the worldprose or poetrywould run
an equal chance of being damned, by him, up hill and
downfrom beginning to end;or praised, in the same
way, without any qualification or doubtas it happened
to be read, by him, before anybody else had expressed
an opinionor after another, a rival editor, had praised
or censured it;or, as the thermometer happened to be
higher or lower;or, himself interrupted, a greater or
less number of times, while reading it. There is no
calculation
to be made upon his opinion of anything. It
does'nt depend, in any degree, upon the subject itself; but
upon the state of the atmosphere, for the timethe source
through which the matter comes to himthe state of his
paper for the weekwhether full or emptythe style,
in general, of his writing for the same weekwhether
bitter or pleasantwhether he have set his teeth into
many or few; and, in short, upon anything and
everything
,
but the true merit of the question itself. His first
inquiry would benotHow shall I treat this man, or
this question, or this book, on account of its real
character
.
Buthow shall I treat it, or him, so as to
excite
the most astonishment? Suppose it a book:the
question is not, how shall I speak of it, on account of
the
work
itself; or the readers of it; or the
author
but,
how shall I speak of it, to avail the
New-England
Galaxy
, the
Editor
, and the
Readers
, thereof. Yet,
after all, why should we scold
him?
All reviewers do
the same thing.
Our Political Writers
are worthy of all praise.
They are apt to be too declamatory and boastful
to be sure; but, in general, their writings abound in a
more rational, practical, comprehensive, and profound
knowledge of what they are talking about, than those of
any other politicians that I knowexcept Aristotle
who is, after all, the fountain of wisdom on that subject.
We have many writers, too, on political economy, of
great meritplain, practical men; at the head of whom,
since Alexander Hamilton's day, stand Matthew Carey,
and Daniel Raymond;the first of whom, is,
undoubtedly
,
the most
useful
writer of the time; and the latter,
except that he is a little too flippantas most young men
are, when contending with established authority, and
rebelling
against iteven to bloodsheddisdaining to
qualify or dilutein his manner of treating Adam Smith,
abounds in more sensible, original, and rational views
on political economy, than any writerwho has not
made it the study of his whole life:nay, that you may
not think my good opinion too much qualified by that, I
will add, that he has done more than any other man
fifty times more than Lauderdalein exposing the
mischief
and fallacy of Adam Smith's
wealth

There is a Mr. NILES, too; a very plain, useful, honest, credulous, vain, culgar sort of a
man, who has contrived to keep up the best record that we have, for historical reference,
for many years. He is an imitator of your scoundrel Cobbettwith not a thousandth part of
Cobbett's talentbut with a thousand times more honesty. He affects great plainness, and
circumstantiality
of detailabout the quantity of meat, potatoes, and salt, eaten in his own
family
as
if to understand that, were to understand the whole secret of political economy,
banking
and home markets. He is a man of no educationblundering over the simplest things
with such an air of self-complacency, too, as I find irresistibly diverting. Thus, he always
uses
went
for gone; and, I believe,
done
for
did;
saying She had

He
done
it immediately, &c.a fault, however, not uncommon here(the editor of the
COLUMBIAN OBSERVER, I have caught in it,) and, probably, grown out of a corruption

Mr. Niles, in imiration of Cobbett,
has called his paper NILES' REGISTER, instead of NILES'Sa laughable mistake for a
printer, and an editor of such pretension; for, as it stands now, it implies that there are two
Niles's

Of his ignorance enough, but a passing word of his
credulity
. During the last war, he
sought out, with the most presevering obstinacy, the whole of a long story about
eight bales
of scalps
taken, in this country, from men, women, and childrenold and younggrey
headed men and unborn babiesand sent to the British ministrywith an invoice!
marked
and numbered;believed every word of itand recorded the whole, with a must
commendable
indignation. Yet the whole story was altogether a
hoax
acknowledged by
Franklin
,
for his own. He set it afloat, for amusement nearly fifty years ago: and Mr. Niles lately
made a
record
of itfor posterity! Yet, Mr. Niles, after all, has done a great deal of good
in his generation.

You mention our
Historians
. We have half a dozen
there are Judge Marshall, and Dr. Ramsay, and Mr.
Warren, and several others, who have written the
history
of our country; and twenty more, at least, who
have pretended to write the history of the individual
statesand the life of individuals. But they are feeble
and tedious in general. Ramsay is the best; but he is
too diffuse, too amiable, and too credulous. The same
idle tale may be traced, not unfrequently, through half
a dozen of them, up to some newspaper of the day; the
sagacious speculations of whose editor are always
preserved
,
as if they were something oracular. Judge
Marshall is a truly great man;and, would he abridge
his life of
George Washington
, to one fourth of its
present size; write it all
himself
, and reason as he does,
sometimes, upon the bench, he would do much to redeem
us. At present, it is said, that the best history, of our
revolution, has been written by an Italian! named
Botta
shame
on us.
There is one work, to be sure, said to be by Mr:
Allen
,
the poet, of whichno, I cannot permit myself to
believe such a story; and, I will not repeat it, except to
say that it was built by the job. Do you understand
the phrase?by two poetsone Lawyerone Reviewer
and one Editor of a newspaper. It
purports
to be a
history of the American Revolutionby
Paul Allen
;
but, what it
is
, it might be difficult to tell. Mr. Allen
had little or no hand at all in it, they say.
Of our
Orators
We have an army of this kind of
cattle. A republican government you know, is the
very hot bed of eloquence. There are multitudes, in
every state legislature; every court of justice; and, in
every popular assembly. Nay, in every country village,
you will find the greatest orator of America. You will
excuse my being very particular on the subjectand
content yourself with a few sketches of our most
conspicuous
ones.
In the first place, there is an entire misconception, and
misunderstanding of what constitutes
eloquence
in this
country. It does not seem to be imagined by any one
here, that eloquence is not a distinct and given quality;
a substantial matter, having but one shape and colour.
The only notion that prevails, so far as I can understand
it, is, that eloquence consists in high sounding words,
poetry, and fluency. No distinction is made between
declamation, rhetorick, argument, oratory, and
eloquence
.
And, when a young man has once chosen his
profession
,
it never enters into his head, that eloquence must
always be appropriate to that profession;severe and
argumentative
,
in the temple of justice; more hurried and
passionate before a jury, than before the bench:more
lofty and poetical before a popular assembly:more
studied, violent, and familiar; and declamatory by starts,
upon the stage; and more awful, collected, and
unbending
,
in the courts of the living God. But, they make
no such distinction. Judicial; popular; theatrical; and
religious eloquence are all the same thing to them. In
one wordthe grand idea of eloquence is, that it is a
compound of rhetorick and poetry, and gesture.
Yet, I have heard Mr.
Randolph
called an eloquent
man. Ridiculous!he is a distempered, rambling,
acrimonius
fellow--exceedingly ambitious, without mind or
judgmentnay, he has not the power to make any man
minister to his ambition. He is fluent, witty, pungent and
burningbut he is neither a statesman, a politician, nor
an orator. He has an honest heart, it may be; but there
is no steadiness in his view; no scope nor calculation.
He never argues, and never convinces. When his
opponents
are silenced, it is by his flippancy, sarcasm, and
insolence. It is only of late, that his friends have
discovered
what his enemies have long knownthat he is
a man of great genius, cruelly disordered; a creature of
high faculties, jumbled together, without arrangement,
and slumbering or rebellious, like so many Persian
satraps
,
just as the whim seizes them; in one word, a
peevish
,
pestilent fellow, out of his element.
In short, John Randolph cannot be eloquentfor he
cannot reasonhe never framed a syllogism in his life;
and his speeches, if a map of his mind were laid before
us; and they were traced out, with all their obliquities,
and intersections, would resemble the route of a
defeated
army. His thoughts are continually rallying, and
never united. He affects to lighten, sometimes, with that
indignant spirit, which cannot, will not brook, the
tedious
formula of demonstration; and he never fails more
completely. Why he has been treated with such deference,
at any one time, it would not be difficult to tell. But,
he never was
respected;
much less, revered; and, never
had any permanent influence; for men, who wondered at
his power; and dreaded his tartness, were afraid to trust
themselves to him, for an hour. It was, at a time of
vol. ii. U
much popular excitement. He came out from among a
great party, and publickly apostatized. He became a
spectacle, like the Jew at Vienna, who is annually
converted
,
at just exactly enough expense, to exhaust the
funds of the society, established there, for the conversion
of Jews, to Christianity. So much for John Randolph.
Let us approach some other of these terrible beings. But
remember;you are to keep what I have said,
constantly
in viewthat eloquence, here, is considered a
positive
given quality; and that, he who is eloquent in one
place, would continue to be so, though he carried the
same style into any other. Thus he, of the forum, may
go to the bench, or into the pulpit, and talk the same
rhapsodies; and nobody has the courage to call him to
account. The fact is, that we are spoiled by the Irish
fashion; and the British parliamenthalf of our school
boys are rehearsing from counseller Phillipsand the
other half, ransacking books of poetry, for quotations to
lug in, by the head and shoulders, whenever it is
possible
and
studying the gesture, attitude, and intonations
of the stage; or, at least, of other men.
You have heard of Mr. Wirt. He is now the Attorney
General of the United States.
He
affects poetry, too;
but, if the cast of his countenance, and the character
given
of him, by those who know him; and among others, by
Judge Rand, of Virginia, may be depended upon, he has
mistaken his power. His attribute is strength
peculiar
strength. Yet, there is a great and beautiful
proportion
in his mind. He is too fond of ornamentnay,
he is profuse and prodigal (tautology, Stafford; but, in
America, that is considered a leading beauty) of it.
Once, this was carried to a ridiculous excess. The
subject
was buried in furbelows and flounces. He is an
author too; and his
British Spy
, the first of his
productions
,
I believe, is deservedly ranked among the most
beautiful of our country. He has written a novel, too,
but I have never read it.
[22]

ButI have. It is only a so so sort of a thing.
Ed
.
It is called
The Old
Bachelor
.
But, he undertook, (by contract, too, I suppose;
what a pity that men will bargain away their
immortality
for a mess of pottage!) to get up the life of Patrick
Henry, one of the truly great men of America;--a being,
who, in his power and originality, stood up like a giant,
among dwarfs; and dictated to them, in the plain, great
language
of
a giantof one, that feels himself, in every
limb and blood-vessel---what they were to do. Patrick
Henry was an eloquent man. Yet, you would look in vain,
for ornament, and rhetorick, and poetry, in
his
sayings.
No!his manner was above that. It was kingly. No
It was greater!It was republican!His manner was
as the manner of Paul, upon Mar's Hillor of Brutus,
before the men of Romeor of Cato, in the Roman
Senate
stern,
and full of self possession, disdaining to talk
musically, or poetically. Yet, Patrick Henry was
eloquent
.
The men that heard him, shook in all their
limbs; and the sweat fell, like rain, from their foreheads.
Mr. Wirt had heard of this; but he had false notions of
eloquence. He attempted to describe itbut, he
described
only
rhetorick
. He wrote a book of five hundred
pages, octavo, to prove that Patrick Henry was an
eloquent
man; and he finished, by showing that he was a
rhetorician;
and that his biographer was beside himself.
There was never a more intemperate, injudicious, and
unworthy biography. Instead of pushing Patrick
Henry
forward, with his limbs all uncovered; standing
unmoved
,
amid the convulsion and turbulence of all the
political
elements of the day; he,
himself
, mounts upon his
shoulders; and covers him, all over, with flowers and
festoons
,
and fire works. In short,
The Life of Patrick
Henry
is a reproach to our literature; and utterly
unworthy
of Mr. Wirt; although it has been daubed with
flattery, from one end of the country to the other; observe
it
has been;
but the good people have just begun to rub
their eyes, and ask, where Patrick Henry is, all this time?
They look about them, but can see nothing, but Mr.
Wirt. The eloquence of Mr. Wirt, is the best and
truest, at times, that our country affords. I have heard
him, pursue, like a metaphysician, for a whole hour
together
,
a point of law, before the court, with a certainty
and precision; and in a style, so transcendently beyond
the technical trash of the mere lawyer, although there
was nothing inflated in it, that I have listened to him, with
amazement, and delight; nay, till I have forgottenand
would, that I could forget, forever! that he was the
author of Patrick Henry's life.
He is a man, six feet, two inches high, I should
suppose
;
with a very large, heavy, but not ungraceful
person
;
and a countenance, of great strength and amplitude,
rather than beauty or precision;--but nothing, absolutely
nothing, except a little pleasantry of the eye, that
indicates
either sensibility or genius. Yet, he has both, to a
degree sufficient for any great man. His manner is
gentlemanly
,
and commanding; and I have seen him, when
it was remarkable for dignity and ease.
As a speaker, his bearing is full of stout, indolent
self possession; and a sort of heavy, lounging
gracefulness
.
It is not easy to express my meaning, in a few words,
without an appearance of conceitwhat I would have
you imply, however, is this: that, in his corporeal
movement
,
there is a gentleness, which is not the gentleness
of imbecilitynor is it the confidential, magnanimous
lolling of a giant; but rather that of a large and lazy
man. ObserveI do not apply this remark to the
intellectual character of Mr. Wirt. I speak, only, of
his physical operations. Yet, in those of the mind, he
wants energy. He is never daring, nor abrupt. There
are no eruptions of genius; no annunciations of the
thunderer
in his eloquence; there is too much poetry; too much
proportion and harmony, in all his doings, for one of
such an athletick nature. He ought to dictate; he should
disdain to soothe. For my part, I hate wheedling, in
men, six feet two inches high; and I cannot endure their
tenderness and sentiment. I can think of nothing but
sick elephants. Yet, I have caught Mr. Wirt at
sentiment
,
pathos, and tendernessaltogether beautiful, it
cannot be denied; yet altogether out of place. These
things are well enough for rhetoricians and poets; but,
not for lawyers and men. It would amuse you, not a
little, to hear our sober minded, thinking people, whose
imagery and allusion, are never begotten by them, but
in sweat and anxiety; wondering aloud at the
innumerable
apparitions, that came up at the bidding of Mr.
Wirt, like the battalions of Prospero, from vacancy.
To them, the operations of genius and poetry are
inconceivable
;
the fountain gushing, suddenly, with light
and inspiration; the spontaneous lustre of eloquence;
the hasty and terrifick combinationsthe exploding
wrath, and beautiful splendours of the heated
imagination
,
are utterly incomprehensible to them; and Genius,
herself, but a pains-taking work-woman; and, even when
they are hurried away, by the rapidity and noise of her
evolutions; blinded and prostrate with her approach, as
she goes over her dominions, upon the wind; they have
that within them, which will not permit them to
understand
her mystery and power. To them, all is labour
and toil. The flocking illustrations, that rush out
thought paired with thoughtlike uncaged birdsfrom
the heart of an eloquent man, when he tears away the
veil; and you are permitted to look into it; are nothing to
their view, but laborious drudgery, happily brought to
bear, by long practice, and after many failures. You
will see them poring, amid the refuse and broken
imagery
,
of a natural orator, after he has done speaking;
as if there were some especial signification in every
chip and fissure:yea, the very painted dross that is
found at the bottom of the exhausted cruicble, with all
its brilliant and beautiful disorder; and fantastick
shaping
,
will furnish them with everlasting matter of
meditation
and astonishment; not, as concerning the opulence
nor the wasteful prodigality of Geniusbut in the
amazing wisdom, and foresight, and preparation that he
has evinced---even while the furnace of his heart was
all in commotion. Fools!---as if the lightning
could
travel slowly!---as if the torrent of illustration
could
be
stayed!---the tide rolled back!---or the fire quenched, by
any incantation, less powerful than that of
Him
, who put
them into brightness and motion! As if it were not
easier
for a giant to astonish you, by a continual exhibition
of his power, than to withhold it; or to slumber forever,
under continual provocation.
Such people will gather up the rough gold, that has
been rejected by the man of natural genius; or thrown
out, in the agitation of his heart, without shape or
purpose
,
in the careless profusion of his thought; and study
it, as they would a series of premeditated coins and
medals
as
vol. ii. U2
if every flaw and stain had the stamp and finish
of immortality;yea, gaze upon the evolutions of a
poetical
creature in her own elementof sunshine and blue
airas if they were all the studied and predetermined
attitudes of a patient, laborious, and contemplative mind
as ifheaven help the blockheads!as if it were
possible
to restrain the outpouring illustration of such a
nature, when all the fountains of the heart are broken
up. Such men will stand, while the luminous mind of a
great being is in play, like the machinery of heaven,
rolling over oceans, and among stars; and wonder, not
so much at the brightness, and noise, and velocity
thereof
,
as at the little expenditure of animal strength, that
is visible. To them, the mightiest operations of the
human
intellect, are but experiments in manufacture or
machinerymechanical improvementslike a saving of
fuel in a steam-boat; or an improvement in any every-day
matter of household industry. Their only wonder is,
how it can be done so cheaply, and so profitably.
But let me return to Mr. Wirt again. His language is
remarkably well chosen and beautiful; and his
ornaments
,
though rather profuse at times, are so free and
happy, that they appear to spring up, like fountains of
pure water, and flowers, to refresh some conquering
magician
in his march:but, I would have him less beautiful,
and more august. Let him come, full of his subject,
determined
to prevail; and leave the toilet of the
rhetorician
,
to boys. For my part, I care but little, of what
materials
;
or in what fashion the harness of Goliah be
made, so that I can see the shape of the giant beneath
it:and so that it permit him to walk about,
unincumbered
:and
yet, I would rather see it of leather than of
gold:---and studded with iron, rather than diamonds.
Conquering or conquered, he should always be Goliah.
I speak plainlywarmlyI feel so. Mr. Wirt is too
fond of ornament, and poetry:it suits not the style of
judicial
eloquence. He should disdain it. A lawyer
should be characterised, by a severe simplicitya stern,
downright, and manful exhibition of power, rather than
beauty. It is enervating to see great men occupied
with little things. Before a jury, an occasional flourish
might be well enough; but, even before a jury, it is better
to reason:and, if a man would convince or persuade,
he will find that the less poetry he uses, the better it
will be for his client. People may be amused
astonished
but
they are never wrought upon, or
convinced
by metaphor. There is a ridiculous emphasis given
to the tropes and figures of some men;as if they were
substantial and difficult things. The barren of heart
and poor of thought, treasure them up; and wonder at
them, till they often acquire a mistaken value, that
puts the good people, who talk about it, beside
themselves
.
The difficulty with a truly poetical mind,
is to withhold its illustration. It is easier, with such
natures
,
for they are always prodigal, to overwhelm, than
to husband. Yet, they, who are unfruitfulwonder at
the profusion and munificence of Genius; while he is
wondering
at his own parsimony. Men of the former
character
are, as a million to one, of the latter;and the
consequence is, that the refuse of the imagination; the
lavish expenditure of them that cannot be spendthrifts;
and cannot be exhausted; is treasured, and stamped, and
hoarded, as something inestimablewritten all over
with immortality and dominionwhile, in reality, it is
worthless in general, and often counterfeit.
Sit down and repeat, to an eloquent man, some of the
beautiful thought, that he has uttered before you, in the
inebriety of his spirit; and he will laugh in your face.
He sees nothing remarkable in it. In his common
conversation
,
he will say finer things.
You
may remember;
but he has forgotten them. They cost him no toil. To
him, it is a matter of surprise that men can ever think
so abstractedly, as that one idea alone, unaccompanied
by its associates and resemblances, shall be present to
them.
There!I have now done with Mr. Wirt. Read over
what I have said, and see if you have any definite notion
of what he is, apart from that which you have obtained
from a few plain words. I have sought to be
very
poetical
and
what is the consequence? You are bewildered
in the profusion of imagery. Could I give a better
illustration
of that distempered rhetorick, which is the
fashion
of the day?the disordered and brilliant dreaming
of men, drunk with adulation, like Charles Phillipsor
yielding, like Mr. Wirt, to a fashion that they despise?
But you have inquired particularly about Mr.
Pinkney
.
And no wonder; for we are not at all backward
in our pretensions to national eloquence, on
his
account
alone. Yet Mr. Pinkney is not an eloquent man. He
is convincing, to be sure; and that is to be eloquent in
one way; but he would be moreand fails. What he
may have been at an earlier day, I know not, of my
own knowledge; but, if any faith may be placed in
tradition
,
there has been a time, when your blood would
quake to hear him. That time is past. Nayso
well do I know the natural disposition of mankind to
exaggerate whatever is rare;whatever
they
have seen,
or heard, of the wonderful, when there is nobody to
contradict
them; that I am strongly inclined to believe that
he is now more eloquent than ever. Till I had heard
himpatientlywatchfullyreverentially, again and
again, I could not dispossess myself of the awful belief
that I was listening to the most eloquent man of
America
if
not of all this world. I had heard it said so
often
;
and by men, so well fitted to judge, that I could not
doubt the factuntil I was obliged to break away from
the infatuation that enthralled me, and judge for myself.
Follow me, and you shall know the result. Nothing
can be further from eloquence; if, by eloquence, be
understood
,
any thing that is persuasive, beautiful,
dignified
or natural, than the declamation or reasoning of
William Pinkney. There is no captivation or
beauty
of manner, tone, or gesture about him. His
best speeches are a compound of stupendous strength;
feeble ornament; affected earnestness, and boisterous,
turbulent declamation. His deportment is brutal,
arrogant
,
full of sound and fury;but the fury of no
man ever signified so much, I do believe;unnatural
and vehement; accompanied with the rude and violent
gesture of a vulgar fellow, of uncommon personal
strength, in a violent passion; and transitions of voice,
so sudden, and uncalled for; as to jar your whole
system
:
and action, that you cannot imagine the purpose
of, except it be to prove that he has the use of his arms,
It is never illustrativenever correspondent to the
thought,---never dignifiedand never gentlemanly.
Yetyetmy friendMr. Pinkney is a great man
a truly great man.His mind is adamant, clamped
with iron---a colossal pile of granite, over which the
thunders of heaven might roll; upon which, the lightnings
might exhaust themselves, without shaking, or
harming
it. And were he contented with such a reputation,
as no man that knows the structure of his intellect,
would deny to him, he would have no rival. He knows
that he is, decidedly, the greatest lawyer of America;---
but this would not content his ambition. He would
monopolise the immortality of a kingdom. He would
be not only the greatest lawyer, but the greatest orator
and the greatest statesman.A statesman, he might
have been; and, probably, one of the profoundest that ever
lived:a lawyer he
is;
and one, whose might is
unquestioned
.
ButGod never meant him for an orator.
He has no property of mind or bodyno, not one
calculated to give him dominion in eloquence; and
were it not for the prodigious elevation, solidity, and
amplitude of his mind, which makes the great overlook
his pretension as a speaker; and the mob to echo
their judgment without understanding the reason of
ithe would not be tolerated for an hour. No
God never meant William Pinkney for an orator: but
he meant him for something more; and, but for a
strange perversity common to all men, which sets them
toiling hardest, for that reputation, which they are
supposed
least likely to obtaindissatisfied with
whatever-measure
of fame their fellows may award to them,
unconditionally
as their natural and indisputable right,
and makes them anxious to live, by a tribute
wrenched from the reluctant understanding of men,
but for this, William Pinkney would have been, at this
hour, one of the greatest men of the age. But, it is too
late now.He is going down, with a continually
accelerated
motion, to the chambers of death.I do not
perceive
any decay of his facultiesbut it is not, in the
nature
of things, that he should continue many years long
er, unsubdued by the inroads of age; or unaffected by
the labour of his profession. His industry, even yet,
after the study of nearly half a century, is
unparalleled
.
No young man toils, with a more vehement
anxiety
,
at his first case, than William Pinkney,
[23]
[23]
It is
not true
that Mr. P. studied, or read, diligently while at London. I know that he
did not.
Ed.
even
yet, at every matter of moment in which he is engaged.
From what he
is
now, as a lawyer, you may form some
notion of what he might have been, had he rightly
understood
his own powers, at first; foreborne to dissipate
his strength in experiment;turned his back, in scorn,
upon the reputation of an orator;disdaining to become
a politician; and directed all the stupendous energies
of his nature to the study of jurisprudence. Who then
would have mated him? Who then would have dared
to walk, where the shadow of Pinkney might have
fallen upon him!
He opened his career by studying medicine;and,
soon after, began to read law with the celebrated Judge
Chase, whose attention he afterward awakened, in a
debating society, where he appeared as the champion of
Mary, queen of Scots. From that hour, his destiny
seemed fixed. He desired to be eloquent. He thought
of Demosthenes and Cicero; and his heart swelled with
ambition. He remembered not, that he was to be a
lawyer
;
and
that Demosthenes and Cicerowere
declaimers
.
He forgot that he was to argueand that they
had only harangued. It never occurred to him that
twelve men, are not to be agitated like a multitude:
nor, that it is easier, to put an ocean of human hearts
into an uproar, than the heart of one single,
sober-minded
man. He reflected not, that the world had grown
wiser too, since the days of the Greek and Roman; and
that he, who should look to move a body of Americans,
in a court of justice, now, with the best thundering of
Demosthenes, would only make himself ridiculous.
But he erred yet more widely.He worried his mind
with politicks, when his course was not to be a political
one; and he knew it, or ought to have known it. He
had chosen the temple of justice; and become one of
its priesthood; and yet he had the presumption to
dream of awing and agitating her ministers, while
sitting
in judgment, with the incantations of eloquence.
The thought was absurd; but it grew out of a mighty
ambition. It had been as wise in the Gaul, when he stood
before the old men of Rome, in their Senate Chamber,
to think of terrifying them by the clash of his armour.
Let me give you some notion of his appearance, first;
and then, I will return to the character of his mind.
Imagine a thick, stout man, with a red, fat, English face
remarkable for nothing at allapparently about forty
five years of age; thin, dark, hair cut closeabout five
feet ten inches high---very fashionably dressed---with
a continual appearance of natural superciliousness, and
affected courtesy;---a combination of the English Bully
and the English Dandy.
[24]
[24]
Since this was written, the giant has gone down,
like
a giant, to the household of death.
There let the fire of his great heart; the dust of his mighty brain, sleep undisturbed. I
have looked over all that I have said; but I cannot alter it. Much as I tremble to stir the
ashes of such menunwilling as I am to put out my hand upon the pall that shrouds him,
and all his anointed faults,yet I must do it. What I have written of him, was written in
truth and soberness, while he was lording it over all his cotemporaries; and were I to blot
out
that
, no honest testimony would remain upon record, for men to appeal to, when I am
where he is, abiding their judgment, in silence. His friends, and them that love him, would
make him something more than a great man; his enemies something less. I who have
been neither his friend nor his enemy, have told the truth. No other man has. I never
heard the
truth
spoken of himI never saw the truth written of him. Mr. Walshin his
modesty, had the kindness, to manufacture an inscription, under circumstances, which the
Baltimore bar will not soon forget,wherein he seems to have exhausted his own dictionary,
in words of unmeaning, inappropriate and indiseriminate praise. Paul Allen too, must
take up his characterand what did he?missed almost every distinguishing feature of
William Pinkney's character, and produced a beautiful poeminstead of a biographical
sketch. Twenty others have done the same thing;but instead of copying from
life
they
have copied from each other; and the publick, in their wisdom, because all these pictures
resenible
each other
, take it for granted, that they must resemble
him
.
YesI have told the truthbut I would blot it outI would, at this moment, in tenderness
and compassion to them that tremble, when his name is mentioned irreverently, were it
not, in my opinion the duty of every man that loves the rising spirit of our country, to caution
our young speakers against the
eloquence
of William Pinkney; at the same time that he lifts
up his voice, with that of the wise and deliberate, in praise of his greatness as a
lowyer!
his learninghis industryhis untiring ambition:and calls upon them to remember that,
and prostrate themselves before himbut, to beware of his style of elocution.
You see what he might have beenhad not his
energies
been dissipated and distracted, by the variety of aims.
Yet, walk where he would, he pursued his way, like a
conqueror;and had well nigh established himself as
the high priest of eloquence in America. It is time that
we tear down the
urim and thummim
from his breast.
He is a stupendous reasoner; but, what you would not
readily believe of one, so characterised by solidity and
strength, he is passionately fond of ornament and
deviation
.
He is a great general:but, in the middle of a
campaign
you may entice him from his entrenchments by a
rocket. Bring him in contact with a truly poetical
mind, under much excitement, and his argument
resembles
a battery of coloured fire worksgiving out
incessant
brightness and reverberation. And yet, Mr.
Pinkney
has only a good tastea good memoryand a large
collection of such ready made pictures. They are not
manufactured in the heat and hurry of the blood:the
light that they give out, is not that of spontaneous
combustion
:but
rather that which is formally prepared
kindled by attritionwhen the material is heated to
transparency in a slow heat. He has not the faculty of
coining and impressing beautiful imagery, off hand:
and his profusion is that of one, who, in his extremest
prodigality, keeps an eye at the bottom of his purse. I
have heard him often enough, to anticipate whole classes
of illustrationand ornament; for, they are, often, so
strangely linked together; probably by their arrangement
in the toy-shop of his memorythat one who has been long
familiar with him and his doings, will tremble at the
first glitter, as if he had laid a forbidden hand upon
some key-bayonet of the Tower; and were about to bring
down the whole armoury about his ears.
I have heard Mr. Pinkney begin, by dividing his
subject
into three parts; and the first division exhausted it.
This, he was fully sensibly of; but he is a great lover of
arrangement; and he persisted in giving us the three
parts, neverthelessin the way of recapitulation, &c.
&c. &c.
Mr. Pinkney has the power, if he had the manhood
and self denial, to use it; to make every stepping stone
of his argument, a luminious spotand to storm the
works of his enemy, whenever he would. But he is
eternally diverted from his object. He is thinking of
himselfof the mob. He cannot forget that he is
William
PinkneyMinister Plenipotentiary; and that all
eyes are upon him; and he will turn aside, at any time,
to answer a paltry witticism; or to quote Gil Blas or
Shakspeare;or scuffle with some poetical apparition
of his adversary;or to tell about the Orders in Council,
in the negociation of which matter, he had the honour,
if the court please, of being an humble instrumentor,
what is worse yet, to compliment the court with the
most downright and lubberly adulation:oror
to sneer at some younger man, who may not have the
spirit
to retortto the giant's heartupon the spot. Aye
and say what you will of Mr. Pinkney's argument,
I never saw him yet; no, neverpursue his argument,
steadily, for ten minutes at a time. He is always
dashing
abroadforaging among antiquated doctrinesor
foisting in a kind of learning, which serves no earthly
purpose but to show how well he remembers, what he
has often said before; and what has nothing to do, and
never can be made to have anything to do, with the case.
These interludes and episodes are forgiven in him, in
compassion to his greatness;and because of his
earnestness
and vehemence; but they ought to be put a stop to. It
is a reproach to any court of justice, to permit any man;
even William Pinkney, to rehearse his old arguments, in
forgotten cases, for the astonishment of a rabble; and,
were I a judge, I would as soon permit him to ransack
the literature of Chinaor explode, in a panegyrick upon
steam boats, as to ramble in the way he will sometimes
do, when he has a large auditory.
Let me tell you one or two anecdotes of him. He is
fond of quotationsand scatters latin about, with
particular
emphasis. These are, in general, pretty well
dove-tailed
into the body of the subject; but they sometimes
puzzle me confoundly to discover their applicationor
placetill he has made both, for them.
One day, he was quite in a tempest,to what amount,
I would not undertake to saybut the fee must have
been pretty respectable. While in heat, he used the
words
outer darkness
simple and common words enough,
one would think, without any authority;but Mr.
Pinkney
lets no opportunity escape, of manifesting his
turbulent
familiarity with the classicks. He drew a long
breathand added, with deep emphasis, as
Shakspeare
says!
Who would not have smiled! Mr. Pinkney had
probably
encountered the phrase somewhere;but
where
,
it was not so easy to tell. In such a case, no better
name could possibly occur, for a doubtful progeny, than
vol. ii. W
that of Shakspeare. Trueit was rather unlucky;
for there were some persons, in all probability, that
heard him, who had read the Bible, and remembered the
phrase;and more than one, who
knew
that, whatever
else might be in Shakspeare, the words
outer darkness
were not But Mr. Pinkney was either ashamed to
quote the Bibleor ignorant of the authority.
He wants magnanimity. He is not the friend of the
powerful and ambitious, if they approximate at all, to
the limits of his dominion; and I have known him to
play off a paltry stratagem, to delude his associate
counsel
;
lead him deliberately astray; assist him in
thickening
his errour; and then, as he rose, turn deadly pale
with the sense of his own unworthiness. But let me
leave this anecdote. It was one of treachery and
legerdemain
,
utterly beneath the manhood of William
Pinkney's
natureand one, for which he ought to have been
shot.
The physical powers of Mr. Pinkney are, to my
notion
,
strictly correspondent with his intellectual ones.
Both are solid, strong, and substantial; but without
grace, dignity, or loftiness; and both have a dash of fat
English dandyism. He affects to be courtly and
conciliatory
,
at timesbut nothing can be more ridiculous.
All the training in the world would not make a
gentleman
of him. He neither looks, acts, speaks, sits, nor
talks, like one. He dresses too fashionably; and too
much, as if it were a serious matter with him. Some
years ago, he was a notorious sloven; and I have seen
him, when the extreme gentility of his coat, would not
permit him to carry a pocket handkerchiefon a hot
dayall in a sweatand actually foaming at the mouth;
yes, I, myself, have seen him, at such a time, wiping
his nose and lips on the sleeve of his coat;and the next
moment, it may be, while declaiming as if he would
rupture
all his arteries, stand and pick his nose, with his
finger, in the judge's face. I have heard these things
contradictedbut I have
seen
them; and I hold myself
answerable for what I say.
His manner, as I have already told you, is
exceedingly
arrogant and unpropitiating; his style of eloquence, a
most disagreeable and unnatural compound, of the worst
faults of the worst
speakers
. Mighty men, they that are
his models, may have been, in the way of reasoning; but
they were shamefully deficient in dignity, grace and
bearing. He is said to resemble Lord Erskine, as he
was, in the day of his power. It is a libel on Erskine,
who was himself a libel on the reputation of his country,
as a speaker. He is more after the fashion of your noisy,
parliamentary haranguers, who make it a point to work
themselves into an artificial heat, the moment that they
get possession of the floor, whatever may be the subject.
The language of Mr. Pinkney does resemble that of
Lord Erskine. His reasoning is about as forciblebut
he abounds more, in what the lawyers call
departure
.
You may be able to form some estimate of his
character
from the following anecdote. You have heard of Mr.
Dextera yankee. He was once opposed to Mr.
Pinkney
in the supreme court of the United States, where
each played for life and death.
Mr. Dexter was a plain man; very simple and direct
in his operations; but once in the wake of his enemy,
there was no turning him aside. He never troubled
himself
with manuvring or flourishing;his only object
was to get alongside; when he boarded at once, without
smoke, or noise.
The galleries were crowded. The debate continued
for several days;and Mr. Dexter prevailed. Yet, Mr.
Pinkney was pronounced the greatest orator in the
world! A friend of mine was there, a few days after;
and was induced to ask some young man, whom he met
in company; and who was really eloquent on the subject,
what was the
argument
of Mr. Pinkney. My friend was
a plain spoken, sensible man; who, when he went to call
a man a fool, always enunciated the word, as if he
meant to spell it for him, thusf-o-o-l. He would
permit
nobody to mistake him.
His
argument!
said the young man, whom we will
call Mr. A. if you please,O, it was aabut his
eloquence, sir!by heaven, sir!he thundered and
lightned
,
sir, before us!he shook the house to its
foundations
,
sir!every heart stood still!hehe
But the
argument?
said my friend, quietly.
O, the
argument!
yes, sir, to be surethe
argument
,
sir!it was so clear andah! here is one of
his figures, sir!These plants, said he, sir, have
been watered with blood, sirandandand, sirthe
thunder and smoke of the atlantic
But the
argument?
repeated my friend.
Why, sirI reallyIdon't know how it is. It
was beautiful, I remember; and perfectly convincing
perfectly
yes, sir,
perfectly
.
Perfectly?
Yes,
perfectly
, repeated the young man, resolutely;
rubbing his hands.
I dare say so. We oftentimes remember that we
have been satisfied with the result, without being able to
recal the process.
Precisely, sir
precisely
. That is my case.
Well, perhaps you can tell me something of the
eloquence
of Mr. Dexter. You are a great admirer of
eloquence
,
I perceive, sir.
The
eloquence
of Mr. Dexterha! ha! ha!excuse
me, sir; excuse methe
eloquence
of---ha! ha! ha!---why,
really, sir, Ibut I
can
tell you what
his argument
wasMr. Dexter's eloquence---ha! ha! ha!
Ah! well, I shall be obliged to you.
Well! I don't know anything about the
law
, sir;
but I a m
sure
that these are his very words, his very
words---I shall never forget themeloquence!
---eloquence
of Mr. Dexter!---upon my word, sir, I cannot
help laughing.
Well, then, the
argument?
O, it was after this manner, said Mr. A.---and then
he took up the whole, and went through it; and
repeated
,
step by step, the whole of Mr. Dexter's argument.
It was a chain that could not be broken. Every link
was perfect.
My friend was silent for some minutes. And who
got the case, said he, at last.
Sir!---O, Mr. Dexter, to be sure. He was on the right
side. That was it! Lord, it was all as plain as A. B. C.
Yes, sir, yes!---Mr. Pinkney was on the wrong side.
---Every
body knows that. Ah! if Mr. Pinkney had been on
that sidezounds! what a speech he'd have made of
it.
There, Stafford!---that anecdote will show something
of the state of publick opinion here. A man that was
capable
of writing, upon the very brain of a thoughtless,
and ignorant
youngster
, as in letters of fire, the whole
of a long argument; so that he was able to repeat it,
without knowing why; and a man; a lawyer; who was
capable of making one of the most difficult and
perplexing
questions of our law, appear as plain as the alphabet,
to a boy; and to prevail against a host of lawyers;
precedent
,
authority, usage, and opinion---and much
prejudice---that
man was not known to be
eloquent
.
There are several others, of whom I would speak, but
I am heartily weary of the subject. Yet I ought not to
forget Mr. Webster---Daniel Webster; one of the most
accomplished scholars among us---a great lawyer---and
one of the strong men of the earth. He will have few
rivals, or none, at the end of ten years. He is a savage
looking fellow, with hollow black eyes; and a stern well
built forehead. He is, undoubtedly, a good man; but I
should not sleep very quietly in the same room with such
a face, in Italy or Spain. He has the look of a
murderer
.
There is Emmet, an old man, with a fresh, pleasant
face; Lowndes, and Calhoun, and Sargeant, and---no
matter whom. Not long since, Webster set the whole
bench of our supreme court in tears, upon a dry matter
of law---the Dartmouth college question:---how, they
knew not;---for they sat upright, the bright drops
trickling down their venerable faces, without suspecting
it, till they saw, in each other's eyes, what astonished
themtears! Mr. Clay is an awkward looking man,
with a kind of homespun foppery about him---wide
ruffles
,
and smoothly combed hair---a feeble face, and a
mouth, remarkable for its expression of imbecility; yet a
man of unquestionable talent---light hair---five feet ten---
talks well. Judge Marshall---six feet---dark and hard
---very feeble voice, and great mind. Mr. Sargeant, a
little, dark looking, phlegmatick fellow---face all alive
with solidity, self-possession and keenness.
vol. ii. W 2
Come to this country, dear Stafford; and the first thing
that I will do, will be to lead you into the supreme court
of the United States. But you will be indignant, unless
I first explain the mystery of the trade. America has
produced several men, that would do honour to
Westminster
Hall---but they all talk too much, and so do
your great men. William Pitt was the only exception.
Maryland has been very fruitful in great men---Samuel
Chase, Dulany, Luther Martin, Pinkney, Harper, &c.
[25]
[25]
Eloquence!
The Maryland Bar is emphatically, the
School of Eloquence
. Let me give
you two or three examples. Behold him!see him!look at him, gentlemen of the jury,
said one of them, in a moment of inspirationthere he stands!walking aboutwith the
cloak of hypocrisy in his mouthtrying to wire drawthree oak treesout of my client's
pocket.
Sir, said another, a man who could do that, sir, must have a heart, sira heart, sir
gem'men o' the juryas black, siras blacksir(a bye-stander saw his distress, and
thrust out his hat toward him)as black as your hat, gem'men o' the jury.
She was youthful, said a third, as lovebeautiful as an angel, sir(it was on a
petition
for divorce, on the floor of the assembly)and as virtuous, siras virtuous, sir
asasas could be expected.
Ed.
The mystery is this. Every lawyer knows that his
client will be better satisfied, if his lawyer talked a good
while, with great heat and earnestness, and
lost the case;
than if he got up,
like
a Mansfield; and, after stating the
matter in half a dozen words,
won the case
. If the first
happen, he consoles himself with sayingWell, well,
it was money well laid out. He earned it. He made
the case his own. It was'nt
his
fault, that I lost it. It
was that of the jury, or the judge, or the witnesses, or
any thing but the advocate. But, in the latter case, he
is discontented. What! says he, only half a dozen
words for my money. Why need I employ him?
Anybody
could have done as much. The case was perfectly
simple. The jury only wanted to hear it stated, to give
a verdict. So much money wasted!
You may smile, Stafford, but it is a piteous truth; and
where is the wonder, then, if lawyers, whose profession
it is, to talk at established prices, should mete out their
eloquence, in proportion to their fee, rather than their
subject. Men will have their money's worththat is, just
as much talk as their neighbours, for the same money,
whatever be the subject.
It is just so, throughout all the world. We do not
mind being cheated, if our neighbours are cheated too.
Go to a shopkeeper. Demand his price. He names it
but abates, and abates, till you get it for half the first
price. Yet you go away dissatisfiedyou do not
know
but another may get it cheaper; and you repent that you
did not try it again; and if another should get it
cheaper
,
you are dissatisfied with your bargain. But you go
to another. He asks you a certain price. He won't vary
a penny. You buy it; and find that you have been
cheated
.
But then, you say, all the world that buy it, are
cheated too. Nobody can do better than I. Nay, if you
buy to sell again, it is better to give high prices; if
others
be made to give them too; for you invest your funds
more easily, and save transportation. O, the shop!
Farewell! I shall resume the matter again, soon.

Gracious heaven, Sarah! are you mad?what can
possess you? Is it possible that it was you.Would you
rush upon your own destruction! Whence are you? why
are you here?would you provoke me to destroy you,
in spite of all my better feeling? Tell me your purpose.
The messenger will wait your answer. His orders are
imperative. He will never leave your door, till he have
seen younever!
RANDOLPH.
ANSWER.
Yes, Randolph, it
was
, Sarah Ramsay, that you saw
the abused and wronged, whose spectre will haunt
you, for your unkindness, forever and ever. What! is it
not enough, Randolph, that I am reduced almost to the
grave by an unquiet spirita spirit, that would have
slept, and did sleep, when we parted; but thou must
rush in upon it, again, and awaken it by a menace. Yet,
I do not fear thee, I do not. Thou wouldst not harm me,
Randolph, I am sure, do what I would to thee. I have
seen that in thine eyes;
that
, it may be, which no other ever
saw in them; the dear gentleness of a spirit, that would
be kind, but would not have it known.
No, Randolph I have not pursued thee. I will not. I
am come here, not to see
thee
though that hope was
sweet to me, I confess---but it was a secret and buried
one---no: I came to weep with Juliet---and to preserve
her. I would be that sentinel over her, that I could not
be over myself. I will protect her from a man---a devil.
Be not alarmed. I shall not go abroad; and, painful
as it would be, I will depart immediately; and return, if
my presence be hateful to thee. Naythat is too
strong a word. I ought not to have written it; forgive
me, Randolphand let me know where I shall direct a
note, if you determine that I may remain here, so that it
may meet you, in case of necessity. What shall I do?
I wait your bidding. Be as peremptory as you will.
Randolph, my
friend
I will obey.

I hear that you are in Philadelphia; and I never was
so glad of anything in my life. Frank has just written
that Grenville has ordered me to meet him, with Juliet,
at Charleston
me
, you observe, not Molton. What
does this portend?more discretion I hope. He will
undoubtedly be there first;and, I dare say that Juliet's
health will be improved by it. Cannot you go with us?
I am sure that you can, dear Sarahhow is it? You
have nothing to prevent you,unless that drawing
master
,
of whom you used to speakor the deaf-and-dumb
man be tagging after you. I shall set off tomorrow; and
hope to be with you by Wednesday night; and then!
then
Sarah, we shall all be happy again. Grenville was
altogether
better I hear.
JOHN OMAR.
SARAH TO RANDOLPH.
Meet me at three o'clock, by the Schuylkill Bridge.
I have much to tell you. Juliet has received a letter
from Grenville; and she has sent for Molton, who is to
come this afternoon. I am sorry to see such confidence
between them; and have half a mind to remain and watch
them. What think you----would he dare to meet me?
But, you do not know him? He is a consummate
villain
.
Hitherto, I have been unable to write his name,
such has been my scorn of him. Juliet is determined to
join her husband, at Charleston, notwithstanding her
health; and spend the winter there. He is nearly well,
she says---but why do I trouble
thee
, with this Randolph;
thou canst not understand the delirious joy that agitates
a woman, a wife, when the lord of her heart, is
resuscitated
,
all at once, from the grave. I shall have to return.
I cannot go with her. Why! dear Randolph---Let me
not conceal the truth---though it cover my forehead, as it
does, at this moment, with shame, to confess it. It is
because
I cannot bear to be so far away from you.
Is not this wrong?----It is. Yet I cannot retract. I
must on---on---on!---although I shudder, when I look
back, a few months; and ask myself, what could have
persuaded me
then
, to a clandestine meeting with a man.
O Randolph, Randolph!---
thou
hast brought me to this.

I will meet you, dear woman----but not
there
. That
were madness. Let us arrange a better place. Cannot
I see you, at your house? What is to prevent you?---or,
if you will take a walk up Chesnut street, at four, I will
join you. My advice is, that you should not see that
Mr. Molton. Nay--I should say it somewhat earnestly,
were I not fearful of appearing jealous. Therefore, do
as you please about it. But, if he be a bad man, with
your present feeling toward him, it will give him some
power over you; and if he be not, how will you ever
pardon
yourself, for the outrage.At fourremember.

SAME TO SAME.
Morning
Yes, it is determined upon. Juliet sets off the day
after
tomorrow; and as there is a charming opportunity for
me to return, in a private carriage here, I shall go
tomorrow
.
I will pass you by the post office, at
three
. But
we must not be long together; and our manner must be
that of acquaintances only. You understand me. I
want to tell you about this Molton. I have seen him. I
could'nt resist the impulse; and, before he rang, I placed
myself in the middle of the front parlour, with the
windows
darkened, and the door ajarso that I could see
him, when he entered the hall. His step was firm, and
haughty I thought,but he wore a large blue cloak; and
I could not get a good view of his face or person. He was
with Juliet for about half an hour; and, when I entered,
I found her in tears, I told her that I had seen him.
I am sorry for it, said she, for he knows your opinion of
him; and his countenance looked troubled, while he was
here. Nayhe confessed that he expected you to enter
the room. It was well that you did not, I believe; for, I
thought that I heard you stepand never shall I forget
his countenance. It was terrible. You passed near the
door. You paused. He threw off his cloakand
turned
deliberately toward it, like one that was preparing
for some fearful act of retribution. You have wronged
him, Sarah; but I would not put myself in his way, if I
were
you
.
Yes, RandolphI have made up my mind. I shall
depart
tomorrow; and, if it be possible, I will see Molton,
face to face, before I depart. I have an unaccountable,
burning anxiety to see a man, who is capable of
desolating
such a heart as Juliet's: but then, there is little hope
of it. He will not probably come again, without being
sent for; and I dare not ask Juliet to send for him.
SARAH.
ED: MOLTON TO STAFFORDIN CONTINUATION.
You ask me, if it be possible for a lawyer to be honest.
I answer yesI think it is
possible
. All things are
possiblewith God. But, let me treat the matter
seriously
.
The law is a noble professionone of the
noblest
,
to which a great man can consecrate his faculties;
particularly, in America; where it is the only direct road
to dominion. Let us examine it fairly, for a moment;
and if it be really what your question implies, let us give
it up, with all its professors, to the reprobation of all
good and wise men.
I think that you are wrong, Stafford; and I believe
that I can set you right. You have fallen into the
common
errour; that of thinking a lawyer will sell his
conscience
to the highest bidder. He
may
,I admit it:
be may, and does, now and then; and, when he does, he
is a scoundrel; and would be a scoundrel, in any other
situation. But, this cannot often happen. Take a case.
A man of notoriously bad character, goes to his counsel.
Can he refuse to listen to him? No.His oath binds
him to administer justice to all; without favour, or
partiality
.
Having a prejudice against the man, is no
reason
why he should not protect him, if he be wronged.
The wicked have their rights, as well as the good. And
how can he tell?what right has
he
to pre-judge his
client
?how
dare he, indeed, when he has sworn to
prevent
other men from pre-judging, even the most
atrocious
criminaluntil he have heard his story? Well....
the story once toldwhat is he to do? He is bound, by
his oath, to be faithful to his client. Though he be the
greatest villain on earth he cannot betray him. Nay, he
cannot be made to reveal aught, that his client has told
him, however it may affect society;yet, more:if he
should dare to offer himself before a court of justice, in
testimony against his client, that court would silence
him, upon the spot.
What shall he do then? Shall he take up
against
him,
after having heard his tale? Nothat were
impossible
.
And how can he
know
that his client is a
scoundrel
,
or a criminal? The best story will be told him....
he will be deceived, with all his caution....and he
cannot
,
it is not possible, that he should, know the real truth
of the case, till he have come to trial:till the jury are
sworn, and the witnesses are all examined. What
can
he do then? He could not abandon the case,
till
that
moment
:
but can he abandon it
then? Can
an honest man,
a lawyer, who knows in his conscience, that the jury, or
the court are to decide upon the case....can
he
presume
to decide upon it?....Yet, he would do it, if he were to
withdraw at such a moment. This is a case that can
happen very rarelybut I will suppose, if you please,
that the lawyer does become convinced, in his heart, that
his client
is
a scoundrel, or a
criminal;
nay, I will even
suppose that he
knew
it, from the first moment. I care
not by what meanssuch a thing is barely possible, and
could only happen, from the evidence of the lawyer's
own senses of the factbut I am willing to suppose that
case, as the strongest that can possibly happen, against
my doctrine. Suppose, then, that the lawyer
knew
,
from the moment that his client applied to him, that he
was wrong; nay, that he was the most guilty and terrible
of ruffians. Would he be justified in refusing to defend
him? Reflect, for a moment. I do not ask if he would
be justified in attempting to cheat, and hurry the jury
into
an acquittal of his client, where the evidence was
conclusive
against him? Still less, do I ask, if he would be
justified in lying to themin calling heaven to witness,
that the man was innocent; and that he believed him to
be sono!for such things are an outrage upon the
sanctity of man's nature, and upon his origin. It is
madness
,
and blasphemy. And he who could say it, would
deserve to suffer on the spot, the punishment of Ananias.
But, I ask if he may not be justified, in undertaking his
defence?
Has the greatest criminal no rights to guard?
He may have forfeited his life; but, is every man's hand,
therefore, to be raised against him? May he be slain,
like a wild beast, wherever he may be met, without
further
ceremony?No.It is as much a part of the law,
that, if he be a murderer, he shall die, in a certain way,
as that he shall die at all. And it is the duty of a great
and good man, to see that the
law
is ministered to him,
in severity and strictness;and to protect him, at the
risk of his lifeagainst any irregularity. And this,
not so much the sake of the criminal, as for that of
society
.
And the Judge, if he be an honest man, and a
lawyer, will do the same;nay, he will set the prisoner
free, though he be reeking with blood, from head to foot;
the blood of his own mother and children, if you please,
rather than press against one of the technicalities of the
law. Nay, the prosecutor, himself, the Attorney
General
,
vol.ii. X
if he feel his tremendous obligation to society,
will abandon the cause, if there be a substantial errour in
the indictment, or proceedings, to justify him; rather
than admit a precedent for errour, or carelessness. Nay,
he will stand up, and tell the jury, like a man, that it is
no matter what they may
believe;that
is not the
question
that
they must acquit the prisoner, though they
may
believe
him, in their hearts, to be guiltyunless he
be
proved
to be so; nay, morethough one of their
members
may have seen the deed perpetrated, he will tell
them that
that
makes no difference, unless that juror
come out of the box and be sworn as a witness; and
permit himself to be cross-examined; and that an honest
jury
cannot;
and, if it be known to the court, that they
never
shall
convict a man, on such evidence.
Suppose that no evidence at all appears. Suppose
that the jury believe the criminal to be guilty. No
witness
is sworn; no evidence is given. Can they find him
guilty? Nofor they are sworn to give their verdict
according to law and evidence.
But, suppose that illegal, or irregular evidence, which
is the same thing, be given. Shall that be received?
No!for it is the same, as if none were given. And,
though I have lived to see a bench, forgetting the
attributes
of humanity, again and again, in its appetite for
blood;a judge, hunting out his prey, like a staunch
hound: turning neither to the right nor the leftand a
prosecutor entering the list, forever,
against
the
criminal
;
as if it were a mere trial of skill, between
himself
and the opposite counseldisturbed by passion
vindictive, unforgiving, and precipitate; even in matters
of life and death:and though I have lived to see,
hundreds
and hundreds of criminals, sent off to their places
of punishment, with as little decency, and as little
emotion, as if they were so many cattle;just called up;
arraigned in a hurried mannerasked, what they have
to say for themselvesand their case left to the jury,
under the representation of the prosecutor. Though I
have lived to see all these things; yet, I hope to see
something
better, before I die. I hope to see a court of
criminal
justice, a place of reverential silence....imposing
solemnity
....and
manly, brief eloquence. I hope to hear
the indictment read aloud, and firmly; the oath
administered
to a witness, as if he stood up, in the very presence
of the Everlasting God: and counsel assigned in every
case, as a matter of course;yet, forbidden to declaim;
or to ramble in their argumentand, prohibited from
all rhetorical displays. I would have it a court of justice;
not a school of declamation;a place for lawyers and
men; not for rhetoricians.
Nay, Staffordto recur, for a moment, to the lawyer
and client. I will go further. So haughtily sensitive
should he be; so righteous and steadythat I would have
him state all that appears
against
his client, with the
most scrupulous distinctness and accuracy. I would
have him disdain all mere
legal
advantages. But I
would have him exquisitely sensible, and jealous of
illegal
ones. Thus, if a doctrine were advanced, which
he could not overlook; and could not refute, I would
have him admit it, like a man; on the contrary, though
it went
against
his prisoner, I would have him trample it
in the dust, if it were false. Suppose that he was the
counsel
of a quaker, for felony, at the Old Bailey. He might
complain that the law would not permit quakers to affirm,
in criminal cases. But, he would remember,
immediately
,
that, if quakers cannot be
set free
, by the
oath
of
quakers, they cannot be
convicted
by it; and he would
abandon the point. It would be an especial hardship,
in that particular case; but, as a general regulation of
society, the quakers would have no reason to complain.
Why should they repine, that they cannot be cleared by
evidence, which cannot condemn them. The law is foolish,
to be sure: or rather
was
for, it has been altered. But,
there is no hardship in the case.
Againsuppose that the doctrine of many a writer
on criminal jurisprudence; and, particularly, that of
Beccaria; which is, that the greater the crime, the
greater the proof to be demanded,suppose
that
that
doctrine
were advanced by a lawyer's colleague. I would
have him search into the principleslay them bare
and never shrink from the work, till all was disclosed,
whatever were the consequences. He would show that
the doctrine was not true: or the application false. I
would have him prove what is
true
that, in
proportion
to the magnitude of a charge, is its unfrequency;
and, consequently, the improbability of it; for charges and
crimes too, become probable by becoming common.
Theft is commonparricide very rare. Consequently,
you would demand more proof of parricide than of theft.
The
conclusion
is false.
Proof
is always the same. You
are not, to convict for the slightest offence, unless you are
satisfied
. You must demand the same evidence, of
the particular fact, upon which a criminal is arraigned,
though he may be the lowest and vilest of society, that
you would to convict the greatest and best. If you do
notyou are unwise and wicked. You are not the
ministers
of the law. It is your prejudice; and not justice
that pronounces sentence. Yet no principle of criminal
evidence is so little understood, and so eternally
disregarded
,
as this.
But it is false on another account. One witness,
unimpeached
,
uncontradicted, by the English law, is enough
to prove any fact. Now, says Beccaria, you shall
require
a greater proof of a murder, than of a theft. Why?
Because a man is less likely to commit a murder
than a theft.
And is not a witness less likely, pray, to charge a
man
falsely
, with murder, than with theft? I admit
that we can more readily believe a man guilty of theft,
than of murder;--but I would ask, if it be not more likely
that a witness has perjured himself, when he charges a
man with murder, than with theft: assuredlyif
Beccaria's
principle be right, that the greater the crime, the
more improbable it is. It is, therefore, more
improbable
that a man should swear away another's
life
, falsely;
than, that he should
swear
away his
property
or
liberty
,
falsely. Therefore, we should
as
readily believe the
witness
,
who swears to a murder; as the one that swears to a
theft.
If Beccaria's principle be true, that, in proportion to
the magnitude of the crime, is its improbabilitythen
is his conclusion absurd; and mine established.
Thus, freely, and boldly should an honest man tread
down the nonsense of the books, when it comes fairly
in his wayhowever it may affect his client. He is
the advocate of society, not of an individualof a
priesthood
,
whose office it is, to minister, with clean hands,
even at the sacrifice.
What think you now, dear Stafford, of a lawyer, who
should defend an acknowledged criminal?what, of him,
who defends a doubtful one; which is the true case,
nine hundred and ninety-nine times out of a thousand.
He hears his client's story;and, make what allowance
he may, he will find it false in some particulars; for
there is a strange propensity, in all men, to aggravate
their sorrow, and conceal their danger, even from
themselves. Thus, a patient rarely tells the whole
truth of his casenor a merchant in failing
circumstances
even
to himselfand a client, never. All are
deceived
,
by their own hopes, or their passions; and who
shall determine?
But let me take a strong case. You have not
forgotten
that despot of New OrleansJackson:nor his
murder of your two agents. They deserved death. I
admit it. So, many a criminal deserves deathbut
still it is
murder
, to slay him without the form of trial.
As well, might a judge descend from the tribunal; tuck
up his gown, and let out the prisoner's blood at the bar,
because
he
was satisfied of his guilt.
Nothe basest and wickedest have some right to
guard; rights that are the dearer to them, because of their
fewness;and because they are tugged at, by every
merciless hand in the communitythough the agony
thereof, is like that of the heart-stringsin their
quivering
tenacity.And an honest man will take care to
protect
them.
I told you something of the mail robbers, here. Your
blood curdled. It was pleaded for one, that he was
young
merciful God!a mere boy!yet he had the
strength to drive his knifeslowlyinto the heart of a
man, old enough to be his fatherboundhelpless
and upon his knees. What would he have been, at
maturity
!
vol. ii. X 2
He confessed his guilt. The money was found upon
him. His partner confessed also. But their stories
did not agree.
Here was enough to justify their condemnation, one
would think:and enough to deter any man, in his
senses
,
from defending them.
You
would have thought
him that had attempted it, a madman. Yetput
yourself
on guard, Stafford. Notwithstanding all thisall!
the younger might have been innocent; nay, the
elder
.
And I do believe, to this moment, that an able
man might have saved one of them. Whether it would
have been
right
to do so, is another question. But
follow
me for a moment.
To
doubt
is to
acquit
. It is better that ninety-nine
guilty escape, than that one innocent man suffer. So
says the law. (But I think differentlywhat has the
innocent man to fear from death?)
Is confession enough? Let us see. Men have
confessed
murders, that were never perpetrated. There is a
case of a man executed for the murder of another, on
his own confession, who proved to be alive long
afterward
.
Truehe had been left for dead.
There was an affair too, but the other day, in
Vermont
,
where a father and son confessed a murder, and
all its particulars; even to the destruction of the bones,
by fire,and bones were found in the place described,
reduced to chalk. Yetthe murdered man was alive;
and returned, in season, to prevent their execution.
One of the two, had beaten himhe became delirious
and disappeared.
How is this matter to be explained?
Thus
. Each knew
the deadly hostility of the other, against their victim.
Each had beaten him, at times, and threatened his life.
Each
believed
, therefore, when he disappeared, that the
other
had slain him. Both were taken up on suspicion.
Each believed the other to be guilty. There was one
chance left; and only one, to save
one
of them from death,
by circumstantial evidence. It was to
confess
. Each,
therefore, charged
himself
with a crime, that he never
committed; in the hope of saving his own life, by being
admitted state's evidence. He did not mean to bear
false witness against an
innocent
manbut against a
guilty oneand against himself, for his own
preservation
.
Again---is circumstantial evidence to be conclusive
even when united to confession. It
may
bebut is it
certain
? Is there no room for doubt? In this very case,
the bones were found;the threat, of death by father and
son, was provedtheir mutual reproaches,their
unquiet
and miserable life;and the sudden and total
disappearance
of the man, supposed to be murdered. Yet
they were innocent
.
In a French work,

LES CAUSES CELEBRES
probably
.Ed.
that I have seen, are some cases, of
a most extraordinary nature, where the innocence of
persons that have suffered death, upon circumstantial
evidence, has appeared, years and years afterward.
Our English books, too, are full of them; and every
year some new case is coming to light. Heaven only
knows what a multitude may remain undiscovered,
until
we are all arraigned,the murdered and the
murderers
the
Judge and the criminalthe advocate and
the jury,before one tribunal!
There is a case in Scotlandwhere a man was
executed
for the murder of his daughter. She was heard
to pronounce her father's name;he had treated her
harshly, at timesand she was found with her throat
cutand he in the next room, with his heart beating as
if it would burst its way outand pretending to be
asleep. He was hung. Years afterward, some old
furniture was removed; or some repairs made, and
letters
,
in the hand writing of the girl, were found,
showing
that she had deliberately destroyed herself.
A man, of a cruel disposition, was arraigned for the
murder of his niece. She had disappeared,
unaccountably
,
many months before; immediately after the
shrieking
of a voice, like hers, had been heard in a wood.
Alarmed at his dangerhe produced another child
before
the court. The counterfeit was detected; and he was
hung. Yet the girl was aliveand reappeared. He had
whipped her severely in the wood; and she had run away.
A young man was hung, on the testimony of his own
sister, for the murder of his own father. A hammer was
found, the grey hair sticking to the haft, with which
the skull of the old man had been beaten in. The track
in the snow, corresponded with the son's shoes. Yet the
daughter afterward confessed, that she was the
murderess
that
she had worn her brother's shoes; and placed
the hammer where it was found, on purpose to destroy
him
.
A man departed to receive some money, in company
with another, of an ill name. He was no more heard of.
They had been seen drinking together in the evening;
and the survivor could give no account of his companion.
He was hung. Years afterwards, the body was found,
with the money in the pocket, in a vault, at the house
where they had stopped. The floor had been taken up;
and he had fallen through, while intoxicated.
Another was executed for the murder of his guest.
Two travellers were awakened at night, by the noise of
some one gasping. They saw a man, with a dark
lantern
,
and a bloody knife, standing over a third, who was
expiring. Yet, many years afterward, the truth
appeared
.
He
was not the murderer. His servant
was
; and
had fled. But
he
, too, had probably gone to the bed-side, or
the purpose of murdering his guest.
There is another case. A traveller was robbed of
twenty pieces of gold, all
marked
. He came to a tavern,
and took the landlord aside, and mentioned the mark.
After he had gone to bed, the landlord came to him, and
showed him a guinea, which was immediately
recognised
.
It was returned to me, by my servant, said he,
this evening. I had sent him out for changeand
when he returned, unable to get it changed, he gave me
this. They went to the servant's room, and found him
asleep. In his pocket, were the other nineteen guineas.
He was hung. Yet, the master was the true robber; and
confessed it afterward. The mark alarmed him. He
had passed one of the guineas, without observing it; and
destroyed the poor fellow to save himself. But why
prolong
the enumeration? It is painful to go over the place
where innocent blood hath been shed.
The books are full of such cases. What then are we
to do?
Depend
upon circumstancial evidence. No.
Reject
it entirely? No. But let us exercise a sound
discretion
.
Apply this to Hull. He has confessed. But that is not
conclusive, you see. A part of the money is found upon
himhe is seen in company with Hutton, before and
after
the murder. Are these circumstances sufficient?
Are they not capable of some explanation; consistent
with a less degree of guilt than he stands charged with?
That he is innocent, I cannot pretendbut may he not,
possibly
, be less than a murderer? Let me suppose a case.
Hundreds may be imaginedbut I will content myself
with one or two.
Suppose that Hull had known Hutton; and his desperate
character: that they had consulted together, to murder
the mail-driver; that Hull had refusedor, that he had
gone out; as he had once, and that his heart had failed
him;that, afterward, the murder is perpetrated, by
Hutton alone. The moment that Hull hears of it; he
knows well whose hand it was, that struck the blow. He
goes to Hutton. You are the man, he says. Your life
is in my power. Give me a part of the spoil, or I will
bring
you
to justice. Hutton consents. The money is
found upon Hull.
What can he do? Publick opinion is crying for his
blood. He has no defender. The very judges put him
to the question. No counsel visit him. He feels that
he must die. There is only one chance of escape. It is
thisto
confess
a participation in the crime; in the hope
of being admitted as a witness for the state. What man
would not do the same, in his case! Show me the godlike
nature, that will submit to an ignominious death; go down
to his grave, in blood, accursed and dishonouredwhen
a single word may save himand give him an
opportunity
of
establishing his innocence at some future day
.
Think of this, Stafford. Imagine yourself upon the
juryclothed, even in your infirmities, with the chief
attribute
of Almighty God, the power of life and death.
Remember how many innocents have sufferedhow
abundant that testimony need be, to
satisfy
youhow
terrible are our prejudiceshow sleepless will be your
agony, if you find; or ever imagine hereafter, that you
have been spilling innocent blood. And were you upon
your death bedcrying for mercywould there be no
consolation in the thought, that you had shown mercy,
at such an hour, in the extremity of mortal
apprehension
,
even to the most bloody of criminals. Nayit is
your voiceyours, alone, Staffordthat pronounces
judgment
of death upon this man. Are you satisfied?
Beware
how you are influenced by your companions. If
you yield to them, without being thoroughly
convinced
of his guilt
you
are no better than a murderer. Yet
how often is this done! Men shift off the weight of
obligation
,
as they would that of blood, upon each other.
Suppose that you were alone, upon your judgment seat;
and no one to divide with you, the sacrifice. Would the
evidence, that you have heard, be sufficient to
satisfy
you?
Would
you
venture to pronounce the judgment of death
alone?
You would not. Then, you are a murderer, if you
yield to your companions. What!is this a time for
complaisance
this!when
a fellow creature stands
shivering
and death-struck before you; awaiting, it may be,
his everlasting doom, from his fellow man.
Thus much for lawyers, dear Stafford. What is your
opinion now, of their right and duty, even in cases of
the most atrocious nature?and do you feel as
clearly
,
as you did, that, CONFESSION and circumstantial evidence
are conclusive?
Thursday
.
Our Tragedians
.We have only one; and he is a
countryman of yours.
His name is Cooper, and he is somewhat of the Kemble
School; cold, stately and declamatory;with a noble
person; the stature of a king; and the voice of a hero.
In some characters, he is amazingly great. His Virginius,
for example, is terrible---full of sublimity. And there are
parts in his Bertram, that would awe and shake the
sternest
nature;and other parts that would subdue it, at
times, even to compassion and tears. On two or three
occasions, where he has been alone, unaided; and left,
utterly to his own conception of the part, he has stood,
all at once, before me, like an apparition from another
world; strong with individual, distinct, and vivid
conception
altogether
new and astonishing. At times too,
there is a sort of regal simplicity in his manner
something
like the carriage of a monarch, abandoned of all
the world, and left to his own resources. Thus, I have
known him to play his Virginius, to a full house, every
man of whom, perhaps, went away satisfied;but
he
was
nothis forehead gatheredhe repeated the part; and so
utterly different a being, did the Roman father appear;
that they, who felt familiar with him at first; and thought
that a departure from
that
picture, would be a departure
from truth, were amazed and confounded at their own
blindness, when they saw him again. Virginius was no
longer the same man.
How often this may happen. Take a caseRichard
rushes in; and, with the voice of a trumpet, calls out,
a horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
This is thought fine and natural. It is the
commonest
conception in the worldand, therefore, the most
natural
.
But an ambitious man, will not travel in a
common
road. He staggers in upon you, therefore, like one
overwhelmed with battleexhausted and faint with toil
his fierce spirit shooting out of his eyes:but he
cannot
articulate a cryhe is choked and blinded with
dust and sweatand, if his voice be heard so loudly, what
is it, but to do that which no mortal man could do, at
such a momenthot, hoarse and smokingfrom the
fieldbeside, it is inviting the enemy upon him. And
that is not a very natural imprudence, in the wily
Richard
.
The actor thinks of all thishe reels inhe braces
himselfhe looks about him, like a dethroned monarch,
just struck to the earthand gasping for breathhe
utters
a cry of desolation and bereavement. And the
audience
are thunderstruck with the novelty and beauty of
the conception.
But a third one appears. He disdains to follow
anybody
.
He knows that all men act differently---and kings,
as well as men. And that the greatest men, are full of
contradiction. It is not even necessary therefore, than
he should be consistent.
He leaps upon the stage like a madman---like a lion
baffled of his prey; snorting with passion; his nostrils
distended, and his blood rattling in his chest---a horse!
he cries---
a horse!
my kingdom for a horse!
You wonder at the tonebut the meaning strikes you
like electricity. Richard is no longer a king---he is no
longer battling for the crown.
Blood! blood! blood!
is all
that he covets nowthe blood of Richmondand for
that, he offers up kingdom, crown and allbut not in a
loud voicenothat were folly and cowardicethe
brave man is more of a
devil
than thathe calls for a
horse, as he would call down the thunders of heavenby
a deep, deep voice, of unutterable meaning, like an
incantation
.
But lo! a fourth!Behold him!---he has just entered,
like one, to whom battle is a sporta pastime; blood, a
liquid to dabble inhe looks at his swordhis eye
follows
the stain that trickles down ithe wipes his
foreheadhe takes his garment in his hand, as if it were
saturate with the slaughter, through which he had trailed.
You can fancy that the steam reaches himand is
grateful. But why is he there? He has just slain
another
Richmondand coldly too, without passion, without
noise. Suddenly his eyes flashhis form dilateshe
sees the enemy at hand; and he is on the point of
shouting
when
he recollects that he is unhorsedwhat is he
to do?in the bitterness of his spirithe clenches his
hands, and offers his kingdom to Godnay, to the devil,
for a horsewhile the malignity of hell, itself, is leering
from his eyes.
Another appears, like an evil spiritwho does
not fight himself; but merely looks on the battle
at a distance---sneering and cool. When
he
utters
the cry, he stands like one that sees a horse dashing
athwart the field---within call---masterless.
Thus you see, my dear Stafford, how endlessly a
character; nay, a single sentence may be varied, by a
man of energy.
So with Talma. So with Mrs. Siddons. So, beyond
all other men, is it with Keaneand so, with young Mr.
Booth, whose Lear is one of the greatest pieces of
acting
,
that I ever saw.
Talma's nature, is the nature of the poet, and the
dramatist; sublime, stately and overpowering; but
rarely
,
if ever, that nature, of which all men are able to
judge. It is too grand, too deliberate; and his awful
countenance, in its wrath, is too kingly for reality.
Your Kemble, I can't bear. I hate his vast action, and
pompous nothingness of voice.
Mrs. Siddons, toobut I must not pretend to judge
of her. I never saw her but once; and that was in
lady Randolph. I was prepared to expect too much
and it was some time before I began to feel satified with
either
her
, or myself. At that moment, she electrified me.
Glenalvon quailed before herand throughout the rest
of the piece, there was a distinctness, a dignity, a
beauty
,
and majesty, that brought my spirit of criticism
prostrate before her.

The other is a blockheadif not something much worse.

I was unlucky enough not to see Miss O'Neale.
And you know well my opinion of Mr. Keanea
compound
of madness, folly, and geniusdaring to an
excess
presumptuous
to the same degreeand disdaining
all resemblance. In that, he is rightI like him for
that. But he runs into such alarming extremes.In
avoiding any given mode, he is sure to caricature
the very originality of his own thought. Thus, when
others are distinguishedin any particular passage--his
first question is. Does it depend upon personal
dignity
?grace?beauty?or
a fine, powerful voice? If
yeshe shuffles it over, without ceremony, as something
beneath him. But if nothe enters the temple bravely;
locks his hands; and gives it, in his own manner, and
as much unlike any other actor as possible. Take that
passage in Othellothe farewell, you know. Keane
has been trumpetted te the four winds of heaven for
that. But how unnatural it is,nay, how unsoldierlike.
It is the whine of a field preacher, at his exhortation.
But Othello is his masterpiece. It is really wonderful,
at times, except that his hysterical laughing and crying
vol. ii. Y
are too frequent;and his passion is too vociferous and
inarticulate, in the handkerchief scene.
There
he is
monstrous. But the play, itself, is an accursed thing;
and I won't waste another thought upon itexcept to
say that I never heard the speech before the Senate,
spoken as a soldier
would
speak it, in all my life.
True
I have married her; they all say. But why do they
not saytrueI
have
married her. A soldier, like the
noble Moor would:By that emphasis, he saysyes: I
have
done ithelp yourself.
Another trick of Keane's;and one of his best, is this.
Whenever he comes to an insignificant, worthless
passage
,
which nobody remembers, or cares forhe puts
forth all his power, no matter how preposterously; and
startles us with his manner, articulation, or attitude.
We are amazed. Gracious heaven! exclaim the mob.
What a genius he has! How superior to A. B. C. &c.
How different it appears, now! We never saw that
before
!
And then the simple creatures take it for granted
that, as he
is
astonishingly great, in trifles; he must
therefore
be, although they, may-hap, cannot see it,
astonishingly
great, in matters of moment. But he is not. In
one wordKeane might have been the wonder of the
agewith better training, a better voice, and a better
person. He has talent enough for it:but it is a
perverted
,
abused talent.
But we have a woman here, that must not be
forgotten---a
most extraordinary creature. She is the sister
of Anacreon Moore's wife---the mother of eleven
children
,
seven of whom are yet living:---only twenty-nine
years of age;---and, altogether, the most dignified and
beautiful woman that I ever saw on the stage. She is no
actress
---but she is the express and eloquent image of
human nature. I know not how to describe her; or
what peculiarity to mention, as an attribute, by which
you can get a notion of her. Figure to yourself a noble
looking creature, with large, dark eyes---and black hair
---with a Greek face---above the common
height---apparently
not more than twenty-four---who, in all the
terrible
,
and in all the tender passions, goes
down into
your
very heart at once. No man, I believe, in my con
science can look at her without trembling, in her times
of passionate outcry---or without quaking all over, when
madness and grief are upon her--or--when her sweet voice
is dying away in supplication---orbut I must be
done with this, or you will think me a foolish blockhead.
Yet, believe me, Stafford---
all that I say, is true
. You
have never seen such acting as this in England---by any
woman. Her name is
Duff
---her husband is an actor
---but barely tolerable.
[28]

Where is Mr. Pelby? He is an actor of great promiseand an
American.Ed.
Of Politicks and Religion, I have nothing to say. I
never meddle with either. My notion of the latter are
peculiar; and not especially orthodox. I hold that
every
man is accountable to his Godand to his God
alonefor his thought and opinion;and to society,
only
for his conduct. And, of the former, I am
superlatively
ignorant, and desire to remain so. I have no
fondness for troubled waters,particularly when their
vapour and ebullition are offensive and blinding.
You spoke of the Bibleand you are anxious to
know whether my opinion has changed of it. It has. I
revere it, nowand never permit myself to dispute about
it. Is not
that
a mark of my reverence?There are
few things, you know, about which I do not dispute.
Yet I am not blinded in my reverence. I have the
courage to think, as usual; and to depend upon my own
reason, as I always have; and as I hope that I always
shall, until God sees fit to take it from me. I can see
in the parables, however beautiful, some strange things.
Thus, the parable of the unjust steward teaches, too
plainly, I think, that it is
wisdom
to cheat our
employers
.
Perhaps I have not called it by the right name.
I am a heretick---and not very tenacious of titles. But
I allude to the steward, who discharges the debtors of his
master, by taking obligations for a less amount.
And there is another---a very strong case. Our
Saviour
bids a certain lawyer to love his
neighbour
. The
lawyer,
tempting
him, demands who
is
his neighbour?
----Christ answers, with the parable of the good
Samaritan
;----from
which it follows, that the
neighbour
, of a
man, is he who does him kind offices; pours oil into his
bruised heart,---and that he, who passes by on the other
side, is
not
a neighbour. Such is the doctrine of the
parable. But such is not the doctrine of Christ. He
teaches that
all mankind are neighbours
---our enemies---
they that despitefully use us; that even they are our
neighbours
.
Else, where would be the merit of our loving
them? Where the merit in the man that fell among
thieves, in loving the good Samaritan?---Yet this
answer
was given to a lawyer; and the lawyer did not
reply
.
I am not blinded I say---I can see these things, and
feel sorry that so pure and perfect a system of morals,
should be liable to any such objection.
So too, in the matter of miracles. I cannot say that
I believe in them; for I have never properly examined
the testimony that relates to them, nor the prophecies.
But when I am able to, I shall, though it would require
a sound, critical acquaintance, with the original
languages
in which they were written. And I dare not
say that I disbelieve them---that were, as men think, to
blaspheme. But I can smile at the folly of them that
believe
, whatever they are
taught
. I have no such
accommodating
belief. I trust to my senses---till I have
reason to distrust them; and then I appeal to my reason.
For example. I cannot imagine, at this moment,
how it would be possible to convince me of a miracle.
I say this, honestly; and, I hope, not presumptuously----
for God knows my heart---he knows that I would shrink
from no trial, no peril, no proof---and that I would go
down upon my knees to any man, who would convince
me that I am wrong.
Thus---suppose that I was to see a dead man, this
moment, arise and walk, at the bidding of another.---
Would I believe that he had been dead?
Could
I?---
would you, or any man, in his senses? No. We should
fly to any hypothesis, rather than believe it---delusion,
or deception---intentional or accidental.
But, take some case, where we have the highest
evidence
of our senses, to make us believe it. Suppose that
we see a body, half decayed---festering in putrefaction---
the skeleton, quite bareand the flesh dissolving in
greenness. A being, in the fashion of a man, commands
it to arise, and come forth! It obeys. We see the
process of re-creation---the bones rattle, and are
rejoined---the
sinews knit themselves together; and the flesh
reappears. The body comes forth. We see it. All our
senses are convinced. But is our understanding? No.
We cannot believe. Our reason re-establishes her
dominion
:
and we distrust our very senses, rather than
believe
.
I could more easily believe that my
senses
were
disordered
;
for, such things are commonthat the whole
appearance
was a vivid dream, (for such things are of daily
occurrence)---in short, any thing and every thing
which
was more probable
, than the resurrection of such a body.
I should shut my eyes. I should reflect. I might go
to prayer---weep, perhaps---but I should never believe
that what I had seen, was other than the creature of
delusion
.
Nay, I might wish to believe it. I might try
terrified by the denunciations of manbut
could
I?
that is the question: could I believe it, though I wished
it?
Have you never dreamed so distinctly, that, when you
awoke, the creatures that you had dreamt of, appeared to
be still standing before you? What did you? You strove
to be more
awake
. So would Iand I should be sure
that I never was truly awake, until I had ceased to see
them.
I find, every day, that my senses deceive me. I walk
into the woods; and I hear my name called. I enter a
room, and some odour assails me---whence, I know not.
No such odour is there. I put a straight stick into the
water. It appears crooked. I cross my fingers, and
roll a pea under them---and I could swear that there
were two peas. Thus, I find that there
are
times, when
I cannot depend upon my sight, feeling, smell, or
hearing
.
What, then, am I to do?---reject their evidence,
altogether
?
No. That were absurd; but, I will trust to
them, wherever there is no higher, or better evidence;
and in all the common occasions of life.
Again.---I go to a juggler. I do not say this,
irreverently
.
I am confounded, by the rapidity, and beauty
of his deceptions. My temples throb. I am deceived.
But, do I
believe
that what I see, is
real?
No:---for, if I
vol. ii. Y 2
did, I should believe in a
miracle
. Yet, I have the evidence
of my
senses
. True---but I, like every other man,
appeal
to a higher power,
reason
. My reason tells me, that
my senses are deceived.
It was not long since, there was an exhibition in
Boston
,
called the Androides. There is an inconceivable
mystery in them. They are little figures, that do
many
different things at your bidding. Among them, was
a telegraph, with six letters upon it; to which were
attached
six strings---three of which were held in one hand,
three in the other, of a little figure, upon the table.
Another
telegraph, corresponding with it, and portable,
was placed at a distance. No connexion could be
imagined
between them. There was no place to conceal,
even a clock, in the machinery. You were at liberty to
make any signal, upon
this;
from one, to six letters,
with all their combinations; it was instantly
answered
,
by the figure. Nay, a little dial was given to you,
with an index, pointing to certain signals. You might
take the dial into your own hands; set the pointer where
you pleased---and the figure would give the signal
required
.
What was I to think of this?if I trusted to my senses,
for it was impossible to discover any connexion
between
the two telegraphsnay, even to imagine how
it could be
they
would tell me that this was all magick;
nay, miraculous. But in such a case, who would trust
to his senses? Not an intelligent man, surely. I saw,
that nothing, but some secret intelligence, could effect
this; but, it was quite as inconceivable, how
any
intelligence
could exist, and how operate, without detection;
as that the whole should be only the result of mechanical
combination.
An ignorant man, a North American savage, would
call it magick; a South Sea Islander, the work of the
devil; in which opinion, probably, a Scotchman would
join. But, a man of experience would give himself no
trouble about the matter; sure that there was some
deception
,
though it were impossible for him to imagine
what, in it.
You see, therefore, that I could not believe in a miracle,
were it wrought in my very presence. Would I be
more likely to believe it then, because others testified to
it, centuries agowhen men could be imposed upon,
much more easily than now?
Understand meI do not mean to question the
honesty
of their witnesses; nay, nor of him that is supposed to
have wrought them. I only say that, if they had been
wrought, they would not have been believedand were
not believed; or, why were others, that saw them,
unconverted
?
And where would be the good of such miraculous
labours
?
Give to any man, the power of healing, whom
he will, by a touch; and the gift would be a curse.
Practised
,
indiscriminately, as it was, it would take away
all terrour from criminal indulgence; and tempt men
into
every excess, and every peril.
Beside, do we not find that there were others, that
cast out devils, as well as the followers of Christ? others
that wrought miracles? (but they were
magicians
) in
Egypt, as well as Aaron? Others, that interpreted
dreams, as well as Daniel? Others, that could make
the grave give up the dead, beside Christand many
false prophets?
What, then, are we to believe? Not that the Bible
is an imposition. Nothat were to reason foolishly,
indeed. For, the very fact, that it is recorded in so
many
places that
other
men did deeds, which were
miraculous
,
is an unquestionable proof of honesty
, in the record.
But, were they deceived, they that bear this testimony?
I believe that they
might have been
. And, it is possible
that we have not their testimony, exactly as it was given;
or that, we do not understand the wisdom, and power,
and purpose of Christ.
But, enough. I have entered deeply, more deeply
than I intended, into these mysteries; but, as the Lord
liveth! Stafford, it were better for me to encounter
His
wrath, than that of society, if they suspected me of
entertaining
such opinions. They would think little of
roasting me alive.
We talk a great deal here, about toleration
humanity
and
freedom. But, we know little, or nothing, of
either. A want of power only, prevents the orthodox
from annihilating us. They do all that they can,
toward
it, now. A Jew cannot hold any office of trust or
confidence, military or civil; nay, he cannot be an
attorney
of a paltry court, in several of our states, without
swearing to his belief in the Christian religion! What
an oath! Any man might take it, safely, whatever he
believed. What is the meaning of it?
And of our humanity, you may judge, from the fact,
that, a few weeks ago, there was a negro burnt to death;
thrown, alive, into a bonfire, at the south, and burnt to
death, for murder. This hath set the four corners of
America declaiming. Yet, where is the mighty matter?
Hanging had been tried. It did not succeed. Were
the people to stay their hands then; and let the work of
blood go on, in their planters' habitations? What is
the purpose of punishment? To reform the criminal;
prevent him from repeating the offence; and others from
imitating him. Would not burning be as likely a mode
of reformation, as hanging? And his ashes, one would
think, would be, at least, as unable to repeat the offence,
as his skeleton. And the very uproar that has been
made about this matter, is a
proof
that burning is more
terrifick than hanging, to the minds of men. At least,
the experiment was worth trying. And, they who
understand
the true end of punishment, will never spare,
upon a criminal, any experiment, which
may
promote the
welfare of society.
A word or two now, dear Stafford, upon the politicks
of our country, the government, and opinionand I have
done, probably, till I see you in person; and, perhaps,
foreverfor I am really wearied of lifeworried,
chafed
,
and haunted;yea, Stafford,
haunted
by spectres and
bloodhoundsday after day, night after night. But this
will not last forever. It cannot. Nay, it
shall
not. I
will sooner die, at oncethan pant and pant, forever, in
this way, after that unattainable good; that something
pure and holy, which I was born to believe inonly at
a distance. No, Stafford, I cannot bear it. I have
deserved
a better fateyou never heard me complain. No
mortal man ever heard meand the words sound
strangely to my own earsbut I am, now, almost ready
to give up. My life has been one of sacrifice. Yet, to
whom is it known? I have done that for virtuelove
ambitionthat would have honouredtears!
* * * * * By heaven, Stafford, it
is too bad. Tears from
my
eyes! * * * *
No!let me arise, and go forth in the night air.
That
may quell the spirit within me, and* * * *
I have been abroad, Staffordbut I am far from being
quieted. I have seen it, again; yet, I do not tremble.
Look at my writing. Is there any trace, here, of an
unsteady
hand? If there be, I cannot see it. I have had
a dream, Stafford. You smile. You wonder to hear me
speak of dreams; for I am not of that people, who see
prophecy in them. I have known men and women, whose
dreams always came out. They would dream of
death; or a white horse; or some such trash. They would
live disquieted, till some neighbour, or friend, broke his
neck, or his leg; or their lap-dogs got scalded; or some
china shatteredwhen their hearts would beat
lightly
again. Their dream would
be out
. And so, too,
happen what woulda wedding, or a deatha party, or
a christening; or an unexpected visitcertainly the
dream would be out, then
, because dreams go by
contraries
.
But, I am no such man. You will believe me, therefore,
when I say, in sincerity, that a dream has terrified me;
that, I am weak as an infant, at times, in thinking of it;
and, that I am fully persuaded that my death is near at
handsome terrible death, too. Would that I knew
what, or where it was to be metI would not endure
this feeling another hour. It came to my bed-side;
itFor shamefor shame.Let me return to
the subject. You desire to know something of our
constitution
,
our boasted liberty. Let me tell you what it
is. It is a shadow. Look at our Declaration of
Independence
.
It is there said, that life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness are
unalienable
rights. The devil
they are! Then how comes it, if our right to life and
liberty are
unalienable;
that we have
alienated
it so
far, to our representatives, as to allow them a power over
our life and liberty, to be used at their discretion. What
does it mean? It means nothing; or, it means that we
cannot dispose of our life or liberty---by any compact.
This disgraceful nonsense is to be found in the
declaration
of rights, or the constitution of Virginia, and some
other states;---nay, it was borrowed from that of
Virginia
;
and the new state of Maine has just adopted it, in
her wisdom. What a pity, that men will not think, when
they are disposed to talk. A friend of mine, I
know
,
took care to point out this absurdity, in season, to one
John Holmes, the chairman of a committee, appointed
to report a constitution for the new state---but such men
are not to be stopped in their blundering. It is their
privilege---their
prerogative. What they
should
say, is
utterly
different from what they
have
said. They should
say, that our right to liberty and life are
indestructible
,
but by our
own
compact and agreement. Not that they
are
unalienable;
for, if they
were
, there could be no
society
,
no government, no subordination, no security.
The freedom, of which we boast, dear Stafford, is
exactly
like that of Moscovy under Peter. The minority
are free only, in proportion to their strength. The
majority
are always tyrants, in all ages; and under all
forms of government, exactly in proportion to their
power
.
And that majority may exist in one man, or in one
million. It is a majority, not of population, but of
power
.
Take an example. We boast of our freedom. The
majority resolve upon a war with a nation, whom the
minority love as their own brothers. Yet, war is
declared
.
The minority are driven into the ranks by a
conscription
, called here a militia quota; and, what is
worse, they are not only compelled to bayonet their
friends and brothers; but to pay others for doing it.----
Dare they complain? They are honest
men---republicans---a
faction---or rebels---as they happen to be
weaker
,
and more weak. If, formidable in strength and talent,
they are listened to, respectfully, and reasoned with. If
a little less so, they are denounced, as the enemies of
their country. A degree less makes them traitors, whom
it is lawful to extirpate. Such is our freedom; such our
unalienable right to life and property
.
But descend a step lower---down to the state
governments
.
I have a spot of land that is dear to me;---the
bones of my children sleep in it;---the heart of her, that
I loved, is crumbling under the very tree, where our lips
first met. Money cannot buy it from me. I am looking
to it, as my last place of refuge. I meddle with nobody.
I am a quiet, melancholy man, only waiting for re-union
with my babes and my wife. But the state orders a road
to be opened through my parlour---over the sepulchre of
my family---the hallowed of many generations. And lo!
it is done. The holiest place upon this earth, to a
husband
and a father, is invaded by the pick-axe and the
shovel---the dishonoured relicks of a family are tumbled
about, under the brutal ribaldry of day labourers. God!
it were better that my wife and children had been buried
in the publick highway, with the common malefactor!
Yet this is liberty. This is the
unalienable
right of
property
.
Mine is taken from me, without my consent---and my
family tombs are broken up, with as little ceremony, as
one would dislodge a wild beast.
Go still lower. I dwell in
town
. I own a house. I
can just manage to make both ends of the year meet.
My house is my castle, I am told. Yet the officers of
justice break into it, when they please, if a debtor or a
criminal have escaped to it. My property is my own,
unalienable---yet I am taxed for paving streets; sinking
drains; building party walls; until I am obliged to sell
my little patrimony, to pay it. My liberty is
unalienable
,
too---yet I am sent to prison. I am insulted,
trodden
on, scorned. I smite my adversary to the dust.
My life is
unalienable
, say these statesman---yet my life
follows my property. Take another case of
the state of society here. A man beats another---some
one perhaps, that is half his size; and old enough to be
his father---and
is
the father of a large family. What
is to be done? Shall the father call him to the field; and
put up his own body, with the hearts of half a dozen
blessed creatures, at the same time, to be shot at, by a
ruffian? No---he shall appeal to the laws of his country.
He shall go, proudly, before a jury of men and fathers,
and sayBehold me. I do not take the law into my own
bands. I dare not spill his blood. But I ask you to
discountenance such outrage. What shall be the
measure
of damages? Let each man ask his own heart. Is
it the actual cost of his physician's and tailor's bill? No,
it is that which will deter the overbearing, forever, from
ministering to their own passions, by violence;---it is to
be that, which will make men appeal to you with
confidence
.
All this is very well, the jury will tell you; and,
perhaps, give you, for damages, about half enough to
reimburse you for your counsel fees. It is too good a
joke, a matter of this sort, to be treated seriously. What
is the consequence? The injured man goes away,
smarting
with the reiterated indignity; his blood boiling in
his veinsset upon vengeancedetermined never again
to refer the question from his own right hand, to any
court or jury. And how fares it with the aggressor?
Is he the better, wiser, or safer, for these paltry
damages
?
No!it were better for
him
, that his blood had
been let out upon the spotthat the bruised spirit of the
other had been appeased by
any
damages.
Adieu---forever and ever---adieu!

SPENCER RANDOLPH TO SARAH RAMSAY.
Something has happened to your friend. She has not
gone; and, in passing the house just now, I found the
lower windows shutcrape upon the door, and lights
moving about, hurriedly, in the western chamber, in which
you told me that she slept. Let not this alarm youyou
have a strong mind; and, with this timely notice, may
fortify yourself. I entreat you not to move hand nor foot,
until you hear from me again. Events of a terrible
nature
are at hand; and we know not who may be called
upon, for his part in the drama.
Mr. Omar is here. I have seen him; but I am able to
discover, already, by one half hour's acquaintance, that
he is a hasty, intemperate young man; rash and sudden
in his opinions, and never steadily awaiting their
confirmation
.
He does not know that I am
Randolph
; nor
do I desire that he should; but I leave the matter
entirely
in your hands. And now, Sarah, dear Sarah, prepare
yourself. To-morrow you shall hear from me, again.

SarahSarah!return immediately;in the name of
God, return! Juliet is dying!her babe is dying!
Molton
is at her bed-side, night and day. I know not what
to imagine, what to think; but some tremendous
intelligence
.
I cannot get an opportunity to speak to him.
Some intelligence, I know not what, contained in a
newspaper, has done this. O, return, return, Sarah!
Lose not a moment, as you would preserve all on this
earth that is dear to you. I cannot go for youI cannot
leave Juliet.

Tuesday
.
Grenville is dead! Helen is dead! O God, all the world
is going to wreck and ruin! Juliet is now,
now
, even at
this moment, breathing her last, it may be; and her babe,
the loveliest creature, by heaven, that ever was born of
woman, is shutting its dear little eyes. O, Sarah, how
can I relate it!it cannot liveit cannot; and there is
Molton, there!weeping upon Juliet's hand!I can see
him at this moment. And Helen, righteous heaven!
there is her poor face, discoloured and frightful in its
vol. ii. Z
beauty, just turning deadly pale. I could almost lay
this hand upon her lips, I can see her so distinctly.
A letterno, it was'nt a letter. I know not how the
intelligence came; but Juliet was breakfasting; and had
taken up a newspaper, from many that lay upon the
table, with the letters of the day; when Molton broke
suddenly into the room, pale, frightfully paleit was
too latethe very paper was already in her hand! He
had just time to prevent her falling; when she was borne
off to her room, the whole family in horrour and
consternation
.
Molton was distracted. He burnt the paper
before the eyes of the servant; and sent immediately for
me. I arrived, and found him walking the floor; the
sweat trickling down his cheeks; and his eyes red, as
with a scorching fire. His hands were clenched, and
black with the convulsion of the pressure. He
attempted
to speakhe could notthe blood stood upon his lips
---he offered me his hand---it was the hand of a dead man
---cramped with cold, like iron. What has happened,
cried Itell me, what has happened? He could not
articulate a word; and we were interrupted by the
arrival
of several strangers. I am disturbed. I shall
write again, in a moment; but this must go off as it is.

I have just seen Mr. S. Can it be possible that you
are yet at Amboy? Yet, I am not sorryexcept that
you will not get my letter of yesterday. But I hope this
will reach you in season, to prevent the evil effect of any
reports. Have you seen Monday morning's paper? I
hope not. But, if you have, let it not disturb you. We
hope that the account is exaggerated. Such things
generally
are. You are wanted, here; but do not comedo
not, I entreat you, until you hear, from
me

indispensable. At present, you can be of no use. I am
anxious to hear from you. Why do I not? But,
perhaps
,
you have written; and the letter is now upon the
road. What has happened? How is your health? I
cannot write any more. It is impossible:but, once
more, let me entreat you to be composed. Summon all
your faculties. There is a tremendous scene of trial
before
you; but, heaven will never deny to
you
, the strength
required to support it, if it be rightly sought after.
But, why did you stay at Amboy? The more that I
think of it, the more I am bewildered. So publick a place!
so unprotected!and now, that I call to mind
his
manner
,
it appears to me, that there was something
mysterious
in it. He appeared anxious to avoid me. Tell me
the truth, Sarah. Whatever it bethat man does not
live, who shall trifle with me, beloved, as I am, by such
a woman! I want your answerI am desperate.
SPENCER RANDOLPH.
SARAH TO RANDOLPH.
Amboy
.
I am afraid to think of your countenance, Randolph,
when you shall see this direction. And still more, when
I reflect on the cause. You have courageyou are
resentful
.
Are you great? Are you magnanimous? Tell
me the plain truth. Can you forgive? If yea, I have a
secret to communicate. If no, let me understand it,
distinctly
;
for there has never been a trial for you, like
this.
I am unpleasantly situated, and somewhat anxious to
depart. Several persons, whom I know, from the city,
are continually passing under my window; and it is not
five minutes, since all the passengers of the steam-boat,
crossed the street, just within view; and I saw more than
one, that would have risked blood and breath for meto
avenge an insultand such an insult! Yet, that is not
what I want. All men are quick enough, too quick, upon
the scent of blood. The weak and pusillanimous never
forgive. They dare not. It is only the truly great, the
magnificent, who can forgive. Are you of them; or of the
dastardly? Did I want blood? No. If I had, mine
own hand could have let it out, upon the floor, at my
very
feet. Would I send him, suddenly, before his Maker?
There were twenty arms, within call, ready to do my
bidding. But I am above them all. I want a man that
can forgiveeven an insult to me, when he loves me.---
You love me, Randolph. I know it. It is criminal. I
feel it. Now, then, for the trial. Let us atone for our
weakness. I have been
utterly---deliberately---shamefully
insulted---outraged---and on
thy
account. Forgive
the being, that did this to me---and I shall never repent
that I have loved thee. It will consecrate my passion
for thee; make it something holy, spiritual, as I thought
it was. Canst thou? Canst thou, Randolph? O, if
thou canst, I will continue to love thee, as never woman
loved man, till the last breath that I draw; and trust to
my heavenly Father to forgive me. Thou wilt! I feel it.
I feel as if thou wert by me, and had said it. I am alone.
Yet, do not come to me. I cannot bear to meet thee, yet.
Farewell. I shall wait here for an answer.
SARAH RAMSAY.
P. S.Juliet has sailed, of course. How were her
spirits? Tell me all about it; and unite with me in prayer
for her, and her excellent husband. O, how happy they
will soon be!
JOHN TO SARAH.
Two days have passed; two days of such intolerable
misery, my dear cousin, that I hardly have the
strength to tell you whether I am dead or alive. But
Juliet still lingers. There is no hope left,
none;
and
we have parted, perhaps, for the last time. Molton is
watching by her, like a brother:there he sits, in the
next roommotionlessalonedarkand like one
who hath no heart leftand will not be comforted. Not
a sound escapes him. He has only left us to, to
O Sarahwhat a ruin and desolation are about that
man!to see his own wife laid, at last, in all her
loveliness
,
within the cold earthand the heavy turf heaped
upon a bosom, where he hath so often slept---ah!
Yesit is done. And all the facts, and circumstances
are yet before me, with an inconceivable and burning
distinctness; yet I cannot for my soul, persuade myself
that they are real.I stopI throw down my penI
shut my eyesI endeavor to recollect all that has
passed
I
feel the wind upon my forehead,and am half
persuaded that the terrible creatures, before me, are
only
the phantoms of a disordered brain;but I open my
eyes. And they are still therethere!---forever there.
God! how beautiful she wasand yet the frightful
lustre of her eyesher streaming black hairher
passionate
voiceO, what horrible mystery was there,
that so fettered her faculties, when I rushed in.She
would have told it.I saw
that
---I was sure of it
again and again, she tried it, as Molton knelt by her
bed side; and she clung about his neck, and wept and
wept, as the hour drew nearer. His
side!
said she,
twiceHis
side!
Omarthere are serpents feeding
thereII and twice he put his hand upon her
mouth, and shook from head to foot. But may I tell,
said she?
No
, said Molton---
No
, love; let it die with
thee, thou cruel woman!
Cruel! cruel! she echoed,
cruel
, Edward, when I
am dying to make thee happy,O Juliet, Juliet, be
thou but as true to himas
vol. ii. Z 2
Hush! hush! for mercy's sake, love,whispered
Molton.
I was deeply embarrassed. What was I to do? I had
been sent for; and it was as much as my life was worth
to leave Juliet.
Shall I remain? said IWhat have I to do?
what has happened? Helen,---madam,
dear
madam, what
has happened?
Come hither, Mr. Omar, said she, reaching me
her cold thin hand. You have been the friend, almost
the only friend of an injured manI
Molton would have stopped her, but she was
resolute
.
Molton! she said. In a few hoursa very few
I am in the world of spirits. My mind is now free.
A wonderful light is upon it. For four years, thine
has been a life of martyrdom. I would have it known.
Nayit is impossible now, for that to be prevented. I
have already taken care that they, who are most
interested
in it, shall know the whole, as it is.
O Helen!Helen! What hast thou done!shaken
down to dust and ashes---Helen---all that I have been
building up, so long, with my blood. What hast thou
done?tell me. Let us not part ungently, love?
Would'st thou have me accompany thee?
Thee?---
thee
, Molton a self murderer!O, nono
no!much as I love thee, dear, I would rather
welter
in flame and darkness
alone
, through all eternity,
than thou should'st share my peril. No, Edward, no!
But it is time that thy abused nature, love, should
know it all. Mr. Omar, bear witness for me. I have
written a letter to my father. God forgive him! He
was a good man, buthe hath done that evil, to my
husband, which God only can repair.
Molton, himself, looked upon her, wondering. So
calm, Helenyet so near the tomb.What is the
meaning
of this? Is it really true? What are your
intentions
?
To reveal one fact to a man, Molton, who will do
thee justice, when I am where Edward, I
tremble
put
thy arm under my head, lovehigher, a
little
higherit is awful to die, dear,let me lean upon
thy shoulderthere, there!that will do. I have
written
several letters. Nay, do not look darkly upon me,
do
not; EdwardI cannot bear itour time, together, is
counted to us; and it were a pity to let it go by
unkindly
.
They are all on their way. The last favour that
I ask, is thisthat I may tell one thing, before thee;
before
him
, before my God, while I have life enough
left.
No! said Molton firmlyputting his hand to his
sideShe saw him put it there; and it seemed to
pain herfor she shut her eyes; and there was a
tremulous
movement of his forehead---a dark tumult over it,
that alarmed me---
No!
Helen, I command thee to
silence
,
by our love---our passionate love. Why should
it be told?---Is
Why?
---she cried, eagerly interrupting him---
why?---to prove that thou art a god, Edward! But
it is too late now. It cannot be prevented.
It is told
---
(his head fell upon her bosom) O, do not groan so
heavily---tears too!---Edward Molton! tears from thee!
---lift up my head-- let me look at them.
No --it is only sweat, said Molton, faintly---wiping
his forehead, I am very weak, and my hair is wringing
wet. Thou wilt not tell it, Helen.
That
is already told, she answered, laying her hand
so tenderly upon his bosom, that the tears gushed, all at
once, from his eyes. No---it is something mightier---
a secret that concerns
thee
. I must tell it. May I?
I cannot answer, Helen---but, O, in mercy, spare
thyself.
Here the Doctor entered---but the sentence of death
was written upon his features. Helen saw it; but she was
not disturbed. I am sorry that you have come again,
said she;---really sorry; for this taking leave is a sad
affair, with women, like me. There is no hope, doctor--
I know it---I am glad of it. Farewell!
The doctor left us---but lingered---went on---lingered
again---and put his handkerchief to his eyes---and shut
the door.
The truth burst upon me in thunder. I trembled in
every joint.
Helen had poisoned herself
. Her face
altered
to the hue of death, even while she was yet speaking.
I sunk into a chair---and all that I remember, of the rest
that passed, is this. She asked if I knew the
circumstances
,
under which she had married Molton,---I told her
that I did not; and then she related them.
Edward, said she, as she concluded---and her
voice was so sweet and melodious, coming, it did seem,
from the very innermost place of her whole heart, that I
feel it yet, like the sound of a blessing in my ears---
Edward---those gashes---the places where the iron bad
worn into my wrist---the blood---all---all---look at me
prepare thyselfbrace up all thy noble nature, love
It will try thee, Edwardloins and brainmore than
deathart thou prepared?
I am
. Was the answer.
Hold me nearertighter love, tighter to thy heart
and let me whisper it.Said she.
They embracedshe whisperedshe repeated itthe
very hair of his flesh roseand he fainted in her lap.
It was long before he recovered. Her tears fell, like a
rain in a high wind, upon him; but she had not the
strength to raise his head; and when I attempted it, for
her voice had altered; and her beautiful forehead
wrought, as if Death were at his work, indeedshe
forbade
meforbear, said she. Listen. I have only
a few moments moreah!that pang. I was a
mad
woman
, when this man married me. I knew it not. My
father did. But he concealed it from me; and from my
first husband. I knew it not till, long and long
afterward
and
then I dared not tell it. II am well now,
quite well---but here lies a man---heaven in its mercy
bless, and sustain him! and give him the wounded heart
that has been dying for love of him.
I attempted to raise Molton's head.
Naylet him sleepdo not move his handslet him
lie as he is, and he will be spared the pain of parting
with meO, how he hath loved that woman!Heaven
sustain her and bless her, now!if she love him as I
have loved him,he will be to
her
, what he has been to
me
all that woman may love; all that she ought to love.
Hush! he movescome nearerhe is dyinghe
cannot
live long. Would that the poison which is burning
here
now, were doubled, trebled, so that what this hand
once ministered to him, in its madness; the madness of
jealousy, were withdrawn from his vitalsO, how
gladly
would I die, over and over again. Farewell!
--farewell
!---my
friend! Forgive me! plead for me!---Be
his
friend---
his
defender in the cold world---and tell---tell
---tell Juliet that I
forgive
her---that---that---but for me,
she would have been happy with him,---but I
forgive
her.--
I---and am now dying in expiation of it. Her husband---
O,---it is well for her---for him---for Molton---that
he---went as he did---farewell!---O, God!---God!
---receive
myEdward, dear----thy lipsEd
I was aloneI know not how long. It was dark, and
I knew it not; and when I awoke, there were people
passing about me on tiptoe;and I was in a strange
apartment;and there was the noise, I thought, of
nailing
a coffin, in the next room. I strove to awake. I
succeeded. A bed was before me. I opened the curtain
they were there yetjust as I had seen them lastGod
only knows how long beforeher lips to hisher naked
arms about his neck---and his hands buried and locked
in her torn tresses.----Was he dead? I had not the
heart to disturb him. I sat by him---hour after hour.
His chest heaved---he breathed---but he spoke not---he
moved not. His lips had grown to hers. At lastI
was in a trance, I believe---it appeared to me that he
arose---took her hands gently---crossed them upon her
bosom---kissed
her, once more, while the bed shook
under
the pressure---and turned---calmly-- very calmly,
to depart.---Come, said he.
I started upon my feet. Whither?said I.
Come!
he repeated, It is no place for us.
I shuddered at his voice. It was preternaturally calm.
Whither? said I. It is dark---very dark.
Whither?--to the ocean, the mad house---sepulchre--
whither thou wilt.
To
Juliet's
, then---said I.
He started as if the lightning had struck him.---
True!---said he---true!---I had forgot. Yes, we must
not leave her. All---
all
must be buried. Let us go.---
But who shall bury
me
?---
thee
---I will take care of
thee
, Omar?---it matters not---in this populous city---it
were well---Omar---yes---thou art Omar---I believe---
let us goart thou not?
Nothing had torn me like this. I wrung his hand---
but he heeded it not. I knelt to him---but he went by
me. I wept upon his feet; but he stood like one that had
no life left in him.
Helen, said I.
Ah---what musick is that? he cried---Helen, love
---where art thou?
I led him to her again---he reeled---and staggered---
and the tears gushed out again, as he held her poor dead
hand to his mouth.
We departed. We are at Juliet's, now. Helen isI
dare not tell thee where---so beautiful!so desperate
Owhat were these mysterious meanings? Can it be
that she was mad?
mad
all this time; and that I knew
it notand Molton?---Did he? It may be that he did.
And can it be true, that she had poisoned him for
jealousy---of
whom---of Juliet herself?---this, then, was the
secret, the tremendous secret, that fed upon the life of
Molton. How like a dream it all appears---the pain in
his side---the mortal terrour---are all clear now. Mad
---O, if he knew it,
he
, who was capable of concealing
that he carried a perpetual death at his heart,
administered
by Helen;
he
who could love her still, watch over
her, and cheer her still;
he
would never have betrayed
it, though he had known that she was mad. And have I not
seen symptoms of it, too?---I have. But her death---what
could possess her? the same spirit of madness---jealousy
---Hearing, as she did of Grenville's death, she has
chosen
to set Molton free!merciful heaven! what a woman
she was!
Omar
.
RANDOLPH TO SARAH.
Philadelphia
.
Yes--I do forgive him. Now tell me his name, and where
I can find him. It were a pity that he should not
know
,
that I forgive him. We might meet else, by chance; and
he might think it a secret for me; or that I were a
dastard
.
I wait your answer.
Mr. Molton's wife is suddenly dead; at a very critical
moment, too; and the story is, by poison, administered
by herself. This, say others, is incredible. The town
is greatly agitated---for Mr. Grenville's death,
happening
just beforeand Mr. Molton's reputed love for Mrs.
Grenville, have given rise to no very pleasant
conjectures
.
His death was cruel---horrible. May some of our
vessels encounter the pirates, and send
them
to the
bottom
,
as they sent this unhappy man---limb by limb. He
appears to have been much respected;---and his wife is
spoken of in the most exalted terms, except for one thing.
She is blamed for her intimacy with this Molton; and
yet, it is said, and believed, that Mr. Grenville expressly
put her into his hands; when he departed. Strange
infatuation
,
indeed, if he or she, be like the men and women
of the earth.
RANDOLPH.
Your healthtell me how it is, I must try to see you,
erelong. Will you permit it? Something of moment has
happened to me. I will explain it, when we meet.
R.
JOHN TO SARAH.
Philadelphia
.
Where are you, Sarah? Why are you not here? Are
all my apprehensions to be verified. Am I to lose all
my friends,
all;
one after the other!either by death or
no I will not say itperhaps you are sick, Sarah
perhaps my letters have not reached younay, it may be
that you are not in New-York. Yes, I must believe it;
I will believe anything, rather than that Sarah Ramsay
has forgotten Juliet, at such a moment. She is constantly
asking for youand some times, when her brain turns,
and the wintry blue of her touched eyes will seem
dissolving
over her dear little boyshe raves of Sarah, and
Edward, and her husbandtill we are obliged to obey
Molton, and all of us abandon her to the women. She
is stronger to-day; more collected; and the physician, I
can perceive, begins to entertain some little hope. His
voice trembles less, when he leaves the directions; and
his eyes are not so dim. O, join with me, Sarah, join with
me, in prayer to Him, in whose hands are life and death,
to spare her yet a little longer, to her babe, if not to us!
Her voice was strangely sweet and gentle last
evening
:
and her rapt eyes, and parted lips, as her delicate
murmuring passed me; had something, I know not what,
that soothed the heart, even while they made it
melancholy
.
She is anticipating deathI am sure of it; she has sent
for medesiring to see me, aloneand I have promised
to be with her, early tomorrowthe doctor forbids this,
but her manner, though faint, is peremptory. I shall
obey her. Molton toono, I cannot bring myself to
speak of himI love himwonder at him, but there is,
I know not what, of awe and terrour about my thought,
of late, as if he were something supernatural, which
prevents
me from approaching him, as I used to. Sorrow
like his, too, is holy:a little indiscretion may be
pardoned
to such a manbut to be the
only
friend, the
only
assured and trusted one, of a woman, upon her death
bed, whose husband has just been hewed, limb from limb,
upon the waterO, SarahI cannot proceed.
He stands up too, so proudly, so immoveably, against
the storm, though it rain fire upon his naked heart. I
know not what to think of him. But Julietmay she
recover. If she shouldwhat then? I dare not think of
it. Strange thoughts are abroad?who sent Grenville,
away?Molton. Who furnished the crew? Molton.
What become of the wreck?ask Molton. It is
found drifting, upon the high seassmoking to
the centreand strewed over with blood and
brains. The thought is horrible. He is innocent, no
doubtbut will Juliet dare to marry him, where there
is such room for calumny? What think you? It were
better to die---aye, ten thousand deaths---than live to be
the wife of a man---by whose instrumentality, whether
evil or good, her husband had perished; a man too, whose
own wife is dead by poison, no matter by whose hand
administered, just at the critical moment. Molton!
Molton! Let me not wrong thee!---I cannot.---There is
much that is inexplicable about thee---but thou art
innocent
.
I would wager blood and breath upon it. But
should a woman, such a woman, marry thee, though thou
be
innocent---what would be the inheritance of her
children
?
Hostility and bitterness for one another---shame
and horrour, forever and ever.The blood of
Grenville
and Molton, would war together to fratricide.
J. O.
SAME TO SAME.
Philadelphia
.
I write again. The mail is not yet closed---but we
have further intelligence. The pirates are captured;
and their story, with all its horrible distinctness, is
before
me. It is impossible to imagine any conspiracy now---
for the pirates were cut up to an unparalleled degree--their
vessel riddled with shot---all their spars disabled, and
more than half their crew killed and wounded. No---
there could have been no conspiracy. It is
impossible
.
Beside, it is found, that not one of the four men
that Molton furnished Grenville with, is alive; they
were made minced meat of. The pirates complain that,
but for them, they never should have been exasperated as
they were;---nor so disabled, that they could neither fight
nor run, when the Ontario hove in sight. I pray God
vol. ii. A a
that this may be true!---I believe it---for I would not
imagine
for a moment, that Molton had put a guard
upon Grenville---to. No, I am glad that not one
of the four is left alive. That speaks loudly, indeed, of
their fidelity. Poor fellows! I knew them well. They
had just begun to understand a few words of English;
but their strength and appearance were so terrible, that
they scarcely ever ventured abroad. Molton knew their
temper, and told me himself, that, though they would die
for
him
, at a word---nay, cut each others throats, at his
bidding,---yet, that they would whip a knife into the heart
of any human being but himself, who happened to thwart
them, for a moment, in the publick highway. He was
careful to keep them unarmed---and at home---till he let
Grenville have them. The seas are dangerous, said
he.---He then gave his orders to the slaves in their own
language. They turned round; prostrated themselves;
raised poor Grenville's foot, and placed it upon their
heads, one after the other. But trust to these fellows,
whatever may happen. They will understand you.---
Signs are sufficient. Just touch the handle of that
dagger---if
you want yourself defended, or avenged---and the
business is done. You might sleep quietly in hell, with
such a guard about you.
Adieu, dear Sarah. I still continue to write you,
without knowing where to address my letters---but in
the hope that some may find you, at last. Juliet is much
the same, I hear, and the babe finely.
Once more, Adieu
.
JOHN OMAR.
RANDOLPH TO SARAH.
Mrs. Grenville is no more.You have a stout heart,
woman; or this blow will crush itO, Sarah, Sarah!
I have heard such things, seen such things. I know not
what to thinkI am half distractedfarewell!
If it may be, I shall see you, erelong. I have still one
affair upon my handsone, and then, we may meet
again.
MR. STEWART TO MISS RAMSAY.
I hasten to offer you an apology, Miss Ramsay, for
the outrage that I offered you. I am sorry for it. Will
that satisfy you? I am ashamed of it. Is not that
enough for a man to say? My family are grieved, and
distressed, and mortified. Will you forgive
them?
Do
not believe that this is voluntary. It is notit is wrung
from me, with tears. Yes, Miss Ramsay, with
tears;
but, in a manner; and by one, that I am forbidden to
speak of;nay, I am not even at liberty to tell you,
how;
not even in justification of myself. I can only say that,
I have been twice in the field; received more than one
apology; and never made one, before, in my whole life;
and that.NoI have said enough. I am penitent
you know my situation, character.Is there any
atonement
?
any? Name it. I cannot do any thing, by halves.
I love you.You do not love meperhaps it is
impossible that you should; but, it may be,
nevertheless
,
when you reflect on your delicate and unprotected
situation. Will you accept my hand, heart and fortune?
They are yours, whenever you please. A word will be
sufficient. Appoint me to any probation; and try my
constancy and manhood, as you will. I have nothing
more to say. I never wrote so long a letter, in my life.
P. R. STEWART.
JOHN TO SARAH.
Juliet is gonegone, for ever. I began, day before
yesterday, to tell you of itnay, yesterday; but, I could
not get on with it! My brain rocks, and reels yet, with
the agitation, into which it was thrown. All that I can
recollect distinctly, however, is this. You know that
I had promised to see her, in the morning. I went,
earlier
,
I believe, than I was expectedI trod on tip-toe,
over the carpet, in the hall;and had entered the room;
for the door stood open, without being perceivedJuliet
was reaching a folded paper to Molton, who sat by her,
speechless, and silent as death; with his hands covering
his faceand grasping his temples.
Is that true, Edward?
said she, faintly, laying her
hand upon his.
He trembledhe turned toward herrelinquished
her hand, gently, and answered, in a deep voice.
It is true
.
She fell back upon the pillow, and shut her eyesand
the tears trickled, like dew, through her lashes. I
attempted
to retreatbut, he saw me, and his eyes flashed
fire.
Omar, is it you? He was rising; when Juliet,
startled by my name, just moved her head, and
uttered
some words of reproof.
There was a dead silence, of some minutes, while we
waited for her to regain composure.
I am glad that you are come; said she, to meI
am very feeblebut, I hope that I have life enough left
to me, for the purpose. Edward, let us be together,
a while....only for a moment....go, Edward.
She reached him her handjust lifted it; and he put
his lips to it, as if she were his own wife, or child.
As soon as we were alone, she requested me to draw
up the writing table to her bed side; and reach her the
letter, which Molton had left on the bed. She read it
again; and again the tears flowed.
There is no time to be lost, said she; I want you
to write a few lines to Sarah; they are confidential. I
would do it myself, but I cannot. I shall not recover;
I am sure of it; this is the bed of death to me, my friend,
and I am not sorry that it is. Circumstances, which I
have not the time, nor the heart, to explain, have ruptured
every tie, that binds me to the world, except that---(her
voice trembled here, and her lip worked; but, it was very
soon over---) my babe---I cannot bear
that
, well---but,
God will watch over his innocence!---and oh, Mr. Omar,
it
is
hard for a mother to part with her new born babe;
just when the pretty eyes, the dear little mouth, are
getting
familiar to her lips. But, Heaven's will be done!
Are you ready? A little nearer, if you please; for, my
voice is very weak. You weep, Mr. Omar. I am sorry
for it. It is painful to me, to see the sorrow of any
human
being; but, to know that it is I, who cause it;
that
is
not well to be borne. There are some thoughts in
your
heart, that I could remove, if I had the strength; some
infirmities of your character, that the advice of a friend,
a woman; one whom you have felt a tenderness for,
upon
her death-bed; nay, nay, these gushes of passion are
unmanly. I expected better things, my dear friend; my
brother
. But, time is precious. Please to follow me---
I do not mean the words---but the thought. Tell Sarah
how I am; and, that I cannot live many days. I wanted to
see her.--I expected it;---and, had I not known her well,
I should have thought it a little unkind in her, to let me
die alone. But perhaps she is ill, herself; or---I was
alarmed at the appearance of her eyes; and she added,
while the colour shot over her forehead, in streaks, do
you know any thing of a Mr. Randolph? I told her
that I had heard of such a person, recently, I thought;
but where, or when, I knew not; nay, that I had some
loose notion of having once seen a man of that name.
She did not explain herself; but, after a few moments of
silence, she added. Has your brother returned? Not
yet; but, I expect him every hour; said I.
Let me see him, the moment that he arrives. He
has a noble heart; and we owe him much. Few people
know him. I want to see him. I
must
. Now, if you
please, to Sarah.
She then dictated a letter to you, which she signed, with
her own hand. I am not at liberty, I believe, to tell
you what it is; for, I have heard nothing of it, since. But
she enclosed a large bundle of other letters in it; and,
among them, I perceived that, which Molton and she had
been reading, as I entered. It was the very one, which
Grenville had left for her, to be opened, in case of a
certain
event. What was that event? His death, I
suppose
.
vol. ii. A a 2
After that was done, she gave me her hand; requested
to be told, when my brother arrived; and slept quietly,
like an infant, for two or three hours. Our hopes
revived
her
beautiful eyes were lighted up; and her voice
was more cheerful. But, all my terrour returned, as I
saw her exchange a look with Molton; when the
physician
,
reproving us sharply for our folly and rashness,
told her that we had hazarded her life, but thathe saw
much, nevertheless, to encourage him. She turned her
eyes to Molton, with a smile, and just moved her head.
He understood itfor his lips were, instantly, as pale as
ashes. My arteries thrilled with it, too. I felt then,
then
, for the first time, that there was no hope.
Just then, a woman broke furiously into the room, and
rushed to the bed. It was like an apparition. I thought
her madbut Molton's arm was quicker than my
thought; for, the next moment, she was dashed against
the wall, and a knife wrenched from her handthough
she grasped it, like a wild beast, by the blade; and I
heard the sinews grit, as he plucked it through the
fingers
,
severing tendon and bone.
It was Matilda. She had broken loose from her
confinement
,
about a week before; and, now, gained
admittance
,
by finding the door open, from which she had been
repeatedly sent, as an importunate, disordered wretch.
Molton carried her away, by main force, amid her
curses, screams, and the most horrible blasphemy.
This was too much for Juliet. She faintedand so long
was it, ere she showed any symptom of returning life,
that we began to fear it was all over with
her
. But the
sound of Molton's voice, revived the spark, for a moment.
She held his hand to her mouth. She wept upon it. Her
beautiful hair, disordered and loose, covered the whole
pillow. I shall not live to see your brother, said she,
to mebut, I pray you, to tell him, that I remember,
and bless him, with my dying breath. Mary, take my
scissors, dear, andI must not forget him,
now
.
Nay, said Molton, awaking all at onceeven in
death, Juliet, art thou so
kind to all?
What! leave thy
tresses to
him!
What, then, wilt thou leave to
me?
My heart, Edward.
He bowed upon her hand. No, love, said he, that
must never bethe only infirmity of thy nature
that
,
Juliet, which has cost us all our suffering, is thy too
great gentleness to
all
thy too little passionate devotion
to one. Do not leave thy hair among men. Thy
blessing
is enough. Even II never asked thee for a lock.
I would not; for that was what many wantedand more
than one, it may be,
obtained
. Nay, JulietO, pardon
meI cannot bear thy tears.
Thou art right, very right, Edward, said she. I
will not leave even the hair of a dead woman, to disturb
thee. But one thing I would have thee know. No man
ever hadnone!had ever a lock of it, with my consent
or approbation, except my husband; and to him, it was
given without my knowledge. I am very faintvery,
dear Edward. Come nearersit down, love, where I
can place my head upon thy shoulder. Bear witness, all
of you, that I forgive, and bless, and weep for my
husband
.
I
have
loved him. I might have loved him yet; or,
have lived and died in the belief that I did; but it cannot
be, now. The heart will find its lord, at last, ere it be
utterly dead. Behold mine! The laws of society are
no longer for me. Yet a little while, and I shall be
kneeling, in the presence of our indulgent and
compassionate
Fatherof one, who will not charge me with
sin; nor punish me with sorrow or banishment, for telling
the truth upon my death-bed. It
is
my death-bed. I
believe
it. And, therefore, do I tell Edward, as I do, with
the voice of a dying woman, that my heart has always
been faithful to him; even while I was most faithful to
my poor husband; and even while I believed that
he
was
a bad man:---but, that you may all understand the truth,
and remember it, at this eventful moment, I would tell
you, further, that,
if I should recover
---it is impossible---
I feel that within me, which makes death certain---his
could hand is not to be misunderstood---it is real, now---
I feel it approaching my heart, while I speak---but, even
if I should recover,
we should never be married
. Both of
us have reasons for it---have we not, Edward?
He bowed, and covered his face.
But I would never set so bad an example to women;
to mothers; or to wives, she continued.
The hour is nearer, Edward---very near, now.
Where is my babe.
The child was brought to her. She desired to be raised.
She bowed her head upon its little face; and, it would
seem, that the child knew its mother, and would not part
with her, again---for its little fingers were so tangled in
her glittering hair, that they were fain to cut it away, to
release
her
.
Baptized in tears, my babe! said she, faintly---in
tears, sweet. Let his name be thine, Edward. And now,
farewell---a mother's blessing upon thee, thou great
heart! Take my babe, Edward---be a father to it!
Molton fell upon his knees; and, for the first time, the
tears rolled out of his eyes, quietly, as from any
fountain
,
without that convulsion and labouring of the heart,
which was so frightful before.
Her eyes were lifted---a sweet smile played upon her
mouth as she saw it---the melody of her voice died away
---she laid one hand upon the dear babe that lay
sprawling
in her lap---another upon Molton's---as his face was
buried in its swaddling clotheshe caught itand the
last words that she uttered, were
I do not leave a lock
of hair to the man that I love; but, I leave to thee, my heart
and soul, Edward---my babe!
Molton actually sobbedand there was no voice
heard, but the voice of lamentation and wailing, till the
bed shookand Molton fell backward upon the floor.
The dying Juliet saw itturned her gentle eyes to
heaven
locked
her hands upon her bosom, meekly,
fervently
and
died. So quietly had her sweet spirit
abandoned
its chamber, that, from her countenance, her parted
lips, her half-shut eyes, we were yet waiting for her last
prayer, when her hands parted, and fell.
Molton saw this. He stood upon his feet---he tore
open his bosom---he threw himself upon the bed---he
held her cheek to his heart---her hands...
God bless me! Art thou really dead; really, love?
How cold thy hand is! He shuddered. Take it away!
away!---I cannot move it!---my veins are ice!---it has
frozen to my heart!---cold! cold!
very
cold! Juliet!---ah!---
no more sprouting, no more flowering, no more greenness
here!---no more summer-time, Juliet!---ashes!ashes!
A long insensibility followed. But he is calm, now;
terribly calm;---as if the worst had now happened, that
could happen, to a desolate man.
Poor Juliet!---her funeral will be to-morrow.
Farewell
.
JOHN OMAR.
P. S.---I have just heard that Molton, and the child,
and the nurse, have all disappeared. Will he be at the
funeral? I tremble for him.
RANDOLPH TO SARAH.
It is all over, dear Sarah. Thy friend is at rest. The
funeral just went by my window. I shall try to see thee,
soon, now. A strange event has happened to me; and
we can, at least, be friends---whatever may happen
hereafter
.
My marriage, I have good reason to believe, is
illegal. I mention this that there may be no future
disquietude
at thy heart, if I should approach thee as a
friend.
Is it true, that the gentleman of whom you lately
spoke, (Mr. Stewart,) is an old admirer of yours. If it
be, I would have you very cautious. Trust to me. I can
do that, which none but a brother could do for you,
Sarah
.
I could, and will, hunt up the whole history of his
life. I have made some inquiries; and the result is
exceedingly
satisfactory. Trust to me, Sarahbelieve me.
My only wish, now, is to make one human being happy.
Let me speak, plainly. I love thee, Sarah; have loved
thee, when it was a sin, and a shame. I have abused
thy great nature. And I would offer such an atonement,
as such a woman might worthily accept. But I cannot
offer thee,
myself
. For many reasons,
that
were not a
worthy offering. I love thee, and shall always love thee;
and, though I be set free from my unfortunate marriage,
I have yet, at my heart, another, and an unconquerable
reason, for not obtruding myself upon thy love, as a
husband. Thy friend, I shall be, through life and death,
dear; for reasons, too, that will soon be all before thee.
Thou wilt not wonder, then. Now, what shall I do for
thee? Here is a man that does love theeyoung,
handsome
,
rich, and wise. Can I promote thy happiness?
Believe meit is
thy
happiness alone, Sarah, that I
think of. My own might have been dear to me; but that
time is passed. And were I young; unincumbered;
unwedded
;
with a heart as innocent as thine own, Sarah, I
would say to thee, as I say now. Thou art free, love
free, as the winds of heaven! Go where thou wilt, with
whom thou wilt; but, when thou art weary of all the
world; turn thou to me, and thou wilt find consolation.
Nay, Sarah, though the hour had comethough we stood
up to receive the nuptial benediction, togetherdid I see
a man, that I thought better able to make thee happy
nay, one that so appeared to
thee
I would, with my own
right handupon the spotnot without one tearone
spasm, it may be, of the heartgive thee away, loveand
travel, the remainder of my pilgrimage, alone. One only
thought might disquiet me. Sarah might have been
deceived
.
I might have been. He who supplanted me,
though he might have had virtues that I had not; though
he were handsomer, better tempered, kinder, than I
andno, I will not imagine
that
no man could ever
love
,
as I have loved the woman of my heartit would be
possible
that he would
not
be so indulgent, so devoted, or so
truly her husband, as I would have been. This would
break my heart. If I could do that,
then
, Sarah, judge
what I could do for thee, now. Thou art desolate and
alone. Permit me to lead a man to thee, who will love
and cherish thee, for ever and ever; one, whom the sick
chamber shall not wearywhose affection and
tenderness
will augment with all that renders them endearing.
Marry him, and I shall be happy. One tear, one
farewell
,
Sarah; and Randolph will never darken thy path,
again. He might watch over thee, and thine; nay, he
would
, but thou wouldst never know it. It would be a
secret and invisible guardianship. May I hope this?
Farewell. You are better. The single line that I
received
,
assures me of it. Never were words more precious
to me. I hope soon to see youvery soon.
RANDOLPH.
EDWARD MOLTON TO SARAH RAMSAY.
By the command of a woman, who loved Miss
Ramsay
;
and spoke of her, with deep affection, upon her
death-bed, as a good, and great, but mistaken woman, I
have been intluced to address her. Mrs. Grenville,
within
one hour of her dissolution, extorted from me a promise
to put into your hands, the enclosed paper. It contains
some of her hair; a picture, I believe; and some letters.
What they are, I do not know; but, from the solicitude
that she manifested on the subject, I am led to believe,
that they were very dear to her, or to you. For that
reason
,
I have kept them a whole week, in the hope of
finding
a private conveyance; and, were it not for one
circumstance
,
I would keep them, until I could deliver
them into your own hands. But, her command is
peremptory
;
and I cannot disguise that I have some
unwillingness
to obtrude myself upon a woman, to whom
my very name is hateful. Mrs. Grenville has described
your character to me; so that I am persuaded, that it is
better for us not to meet, until your prejudices are
somewhat
softened. I respect you, Miss Ramsay; and I
would do much to convince you of it; but I respect
myself
,
too much, to enter into a defence of my conduct, even
at the request of Juliet herself, before any human being
that knew
her
sentiments for me; and yet believed me to
be a villain.
Your knowledge of
her
character, Miss Ramsay, should
have taught you some indulgence; some charity, for
mine. We might have met. If we had, I do not doubt
but you would have suffered, for your precipitation and
rashness. But why address you in this manner. You
have cruelly and continually wronged a man, whom you
knew not; whom you had never seen, merely because,
like every other man's,
his
conduct was
capable
of a
wicked interpretation. I forgive you, nevertheless; and
if we should ever meet upon this earth, or another, I
shall be the first to repeat, again and again, that
I
forgive
you
.

Juliet

JULIET TO SARAH, IN THE HAND WRITING OF MR. OMAR.
A few hours more, at furthest, dear Sarah; and I shall
be beyond the reach of sorrow or temptation. I have
been a good deal disturbed, and terrified at the thought;
but, more recent meditation; and two or three strange
events, which these letters will explain, have prepared
me to meet death with cheerfulness. I have no hope
left in life; not one. At first, there was an agony, but it
was soon over, for the loss of my husband. It was that,
which first penetrated my heart---but his own letters,
will show to thee, that, I have reason for consolation.---
Then came the thought of my babe, Sarah---for I am now
a mother---a mother, for a few hours only---and, theO,
I cannot describe the bitterness of that thought;but there
was a consolation even for that. My mind is now
tranquil
,
comparatively, I mean; and more truly resigned,
I am sure, to the bereavement of my life, than it was in
my terrible sickness, summer before last:---one only thing
remained to trouble me. It was that Sarah was not
near me. Had she been---and, had I been blessed with a
daughter, instead of a son, Sarah should have been her
mother. As it is, I can only pray, that, during the
peril
of his infancy, she will be near my babe, and bless it.
Canst thou do this, Sarah?---Canst thou, when all is
known? Thou mayest have to share the sweet
guardianship
,
with one,---I will not name him---thy mortal
hatred for him, that unnatural scorn and bitterness with
which thou hast pursued that man, Sarah, is upon my
breast at this moment, like a malediction. What had
he done to thee, Sarah? What hadst thou known of him,
which was not capable of a charitable interpretation. I
urged him to see thee---to deliver these letters to
thee:he knows not what they are---and it is well that
he does not---to tell thee, in his deliberate, firm way,
the simple truth of our history, and love----nay, of all
that concerned me. He would have evaded my prayer
---he would have put it off; but, I pressed it upon him,
until he consented, if you ever met, to vindicate
himself
,
as he would another;---with this reservation alone,
insisted upon, by himself, that, in defending himself, he
should not be called upon to produce any proofs; or to
impeach, in any way, the character of any other person.
This is his nature, Sarah; he will be believed, on his
bare word, or not at all; and he will sooner perish, in
the hatred and scorn of all the world; than protect
himself
by the destruction of others; of them that he loves,
I mean; for, had he the power, he would lay the world
in ashes,---even
now
,---I know that he would have
done it,
once;
---if them, that he did
not
love, should step
with their shadow between him, and his ambition.---
Helen, his wife, my husband, and myself seem to be all
concerned, in the engagement. It is for the purpose of
counteracting the effect, which I anticipate from this
proud, high spirit in him; and bringing my dear Sarah, to
a sense of her injustice, that I have collected, and
preserved
these letters; and that I now bequeath them to
her, as my dearest deposite. Read them; and do him
justice---as speedily, I would say, as possible; for the
quiet of thine own spirit; for, it may be, that he, himself,
hath not long to live:---it may be, that, ere that
atonement
shall be offered, he will have joined the three
beings
,
whose very ashes he would keep from dishononr,
vol. ii. Bb
and irreverence, at the peril of his own reputation. Two
of them; nay, three, are already where such sentiments
can have little weight or influence with them;---yet a

death-bed vision---and my soul wept and prayed to avert
it; but it might not bea

Your husband is dead, madamtorn to pieces, by wild
beasts. I am glad of it. He deserved it. I could tell
you a tale of him, that would make you hate his memory,
like death; plausible as he waskind as he was; but I have
not the
proof
within my reachand, though I know that
the conspiracy existed, yet I have not the heart, utterly
to destroy a woman, whose lord hath played so falsely
with her. All that I would do, is
this
arouse her to a
sense of her own excellence. What!a creature that

Before you have finished this letter, I shall be dead.

O,
how I should have loved thee, woman, wast
thou my sister; yea, anybody,
anybody
of all this earth,
except the
first
love of Edward
that
I cannot forgive
will notand yet, I cannot hate theefor, I have
wronged
thee. Who married thee?who drove thee with a
thong of serpents into the toil?was it Jane?ay.
But who spirited Jane up to the work?who furnished
her
with facts that maddened thee;--facts, that Molton had
told me in his sleep. It was I!I, alone! But for that,
thy indignation at his baseness and treacheryit was
that
which drove thee into Grenville's arms. I knew
it. I knew then. The artifices of Jane were paltry.
She was an ordinary woman. They would have failed,
but for meeven theyand thou hadst never been the
husband of Grenville. But she was rewarded. The
fooland that other woman of darkness, that Matilda
the Lord, God Omnipotent, hath been upon them both.
The one is madand the other destroyed herself. How?
let her be careful, if she come to life again, how she
send her letters of guilt
unsealed
. She was a
murderess
.
I knew it. I kept the secret, like a charged
thunderbolt
,
to launch at her brain, whenever I was weary
of her. The hand of him, that she loved, sent it.It
went. She became, on the spot, a heap of blood and
ashes
.
And Grenville too, I could have slain himhe was in
my power; but I forbore, lest the mighty reward of all
my labour; thy separation, for ever and ever, from
Edward
,
should be nought. Yethe was weakand he
had rifled,visited
that
were enough to deserve his
fatea heart, where the image of Molton was
concealed
.
The pirates were upon him;and his bones were
splintered; and his flesh hacked, tilleven I wept
to hear of it.
Then came the thought of retribution. I knelt down.
I prayed not to be mad, for a little while. I owed some
terrible atonement, for all that I had made him suffer
Molton, I meanah!if I do not hurry, I shall never
live to finish the tale. I owed him some reward for
his love and constancy.
Your
husband was out of the
way.Let
his
wife follow, and he would be rewarded, I
thought. Should I let out my heart's blood at his feet?
No!for though I was determined to die;and let
them that would, roll my corpse away, from the road to
thy bed, Julietyet, it was unsightly to die in blood;
and Jane too,--she was an ordinary woman---she died so.
True, it was a fit of passion in
her
but I scorn that
what I have done, evil or good, has been deliberately
done. I wanted to
talk
with Molton too, after I should feel
my heart on fire; when it was too late for the aid of
man to help me.I could not do this, if I slew myself,
as she did;and then he might suspect my purpose, if
I reasoned of it; and withhold me. Should it be
poison
?My
hand was somewhat familiar with that. I
had given it to him once. So---I took poison. It is at
work now---I feel it---here,
here!
---the tissue tightens
about my heart; and my breathing, scorches my own lips.
But let me tell thee, how that was It was in her arms--
our cheeks touched, and thrilled---I was sleeping upon
his shoulder; and, as I loved to sleep, even in that
haunted
room---with my eyes just open---and a voluptuous,
rich drowsiness, all about me. He whispered; and put
his hand upon my forehead.---I turned, trembling,
toward
him, and our arms were interlaced,---just then---
aye, just
then
--hell and furies!--he whispered thy name--
it was not
Helen
, that he uttered---no, no!---it was
Juliet
.
The curtain shivered, and swam before my
eyes---I dashed away his hands---and I knew not
what followed---but I had a dream---and when I
awoke, he was there, standing over me.---It was broad
day light---I looked at my hands, expecting to find thy
blood, or
his
, upon them---for such was my dream.---I
thought that I had left my bed, and entered thine; and
left thee, with the blood gushing out of thy sidenay,
Juliet---hast thou forgotten the alarm, when somebody
came to thy window at night. That was I!---Two
miles had I wandered, with the instinct of a blood hound
to his prey---but I was baffled. How, I know not---I
heard voices---and a shot was fired. All this past
through my mind; but my hands were clean---no blood
upon them. I looked at them. I felt strangely
bewildered
;
and yet---there was a burning distinctness in
one apparition, that I had seen. It stood upon the blue
water---and its eyes were like the stars in winter, all
the brighter for their coldness---I approached---meaning
to strangle it---but the water shivered, and broke, and
sparkled, like glass in the star light, wherever I set my
foot.---It was thee!---I was awake now,---I
remembered
a goblet.---I turned to where I had seen it in my
delirium. There it was---there---with the blood-red
sediment at the bottom, yet---the infernal drug. I
was broad awake, in an instant---I caught Edward's
hand---I wrung it---O, my God!---my God! it would
not vanish.---I caught at it, I dashed into dust. He
was terrified---and I---I dared not ask him, what he knew
of the goblet. A whole hour passed; and then, I sat
me down calmly; took his two hands into mine, and
asked him, steadily, what had been in it.
I know not, love, said he. It is the cup that thy hand
offered me this morning, as I awoke early, and found
thee, thy hair wet and dripping---and thy limbs all
trembling, Did you,
did
you swallow it? said I,
gasping for breath.
I did
?---was the replyand he
put his lips upon my eye lids.
It was death
, Edward, said I.
He did not appear to heed me.---But I proceeded---I
told him all---where the poison had been hid; why I had
prepared it---and that there was no hope for him.
He took my hand---his countenance darkened; and,
for a moment, he looked as he were about to crush me
vol. ii. B b 2
under his feet---the next, it was a terrible struggle,he
fell upon my bosom,Mistaken woman, he cried,
what could possess thee! Thou hast drugged with
death, the truest heartthat
O, I know not what prevented me, from dashing my
brains out, upon the spot. To be so met; so rewarded; for
a deed like mine, when I had only prepared myself to
be scattered by a whirlwind---for I knew him---and I
knew that nothing mortal could withstand him, in his
wrath---when I expected him to tear off the poisoned
reptile that enfolded him, and tread it to death;-- O,
God,---to be caressed, more warmly, more tenderly,
than ever!
I fell at his feet---but just then, a thought---O, it was
devilish---shot over my brain. By what name, said I,
did I adjure thee to drink it?---I began to have a faint,
yet burning recollection of the whole.
He looked me steadily in the face.---By a name,
proud woman---that,
mad
as thou act, (O, Juliet; he
knew not how true were his words, at that moment!---
I
was
mad;---I had been---) by a name, said he, at the
sound of which, even in my grave, I would arise, and
exhaust
;
drain, to the very dregs---the chalice of hell,
itself
.
By the name of
Juliet
.
I started at the soundthe blood frothed in my
arteries
.---I
burst from his arms---my heart felt suddenly
distended, as if a torrent had discharged itself, all at
once, into it.
It was many days, before I recovered. But Edward
was alive---and only alive. The operation of the poison,
was slow, but never the less fatal. It hath burnt
within
him, from that hour to this---and will, to his dying
day.
It was the knowledge of this, that withheld him from
thee
, Juliet. He loved thee, to death and distraction.
He never loved me, never!---It was pity only, and
compassion
,
that led him, in a moment, of romantick
delirium
,
to marry me. Bid him tell thee, the tale. From
that hour, he never knew one of tranquillity. He wept
of thee---talked of thee, continually; of thy innocence
and helplessness;---but never, when awake;---and never
had I permitted him to know that I was informed of it.
He was silent on the subject; and so was I; he, from
tenderness; and I, from wounded pride. What could he
do? He could have set himself free, at any hour he
pleased
,
from me; for our marriage was illegal:---but he
would not, for he knew that my life was bound up in his
love. The temptation was terrible. He had only to
speak the word---a single word; and my
husband
,---my
first husband, stood ready to take me to his bosom; nay,
a single word would have sent me, back, alone, over the
wide Atlantick. He loved thee, yet,might not that
love tempt him to wander?---Could it be expected, that
he would always remain so devoted to
me
, while he so
loved another,merely, because it was
my
happiness;
my
only happiness, in a land of strangers. But the
poison
wrought. Then was it,
then!
for the first time, that I
felt sure of him! I knew his nature too well;---I knew
that, were I dead at his feet, he would never marry thee;
never tell his love,---while that death was eating into
his vitals. I was right. He avoided thee. He told
thee of his marriage. It was false. We were married,
it is true---but illegally. I was the wife of
another
man, at the same moment; and a
lunatick!
---He could
have separated me, from him, for ever, at a word.
Do you shudder? It is true, so help me, God! I did
not know it, myself. It was long, and long after, that
I learnt it; and then, I dared not tell the truth. He had
married me, because he saw my flesh lacerated, my lips
torn, and my wrists stained with the iron that bound
me. I knew not the reason; and I told the tale as it
appeared
to me. Gracious heaven! will it be believed, that
my father had concealed the tremendous disorder from
my first husband; and that I, a lunatick, was married,
in the holy church, to a man that loved me!---O, I
cannot
tell thee, how fervently. It was our hereditary
disorder
;
but my father was ambitious.
I had discovered this---might not Molton? And, if he
did, would he not avail himself of it, to part with me,
foreverand fly to thee? The thought haunted me,
night and day, before the poison had been given. At
last, a plot was matured. Jane and Matilda, and I,
prepared
the infernal ingredientsand thy husband stood
by, holding thy hand over themwhile a priest muttered
his incantation. Juliet, there were faces, other than of this
earth, seen in the smoke of the church, that morning!
And there were living creatures near thee, as the
benediction
was pronounced; and when that faint sickness of
the heart, came over thee. I was thereeven I. Then,
I was secure. But where, when can the guilty say this.
Cold sweats were upon me, night and day. Edward
waxed thinner and thinner, every hour; and, every hour,
I felt as if my heart had been thrown into a coil of
tangled
serpentshungryand I could fancy that the blood
dripped from their jaws, continually, like fire, upon the
wound.
Many times, I was ready to throw myself at the feet
of Edward; and confess the whole. O, I knew not that
he was already master of it; and that he forgave me---the
cruellest thing of all!only from discovering, by an
interview
with Mr. Grenville, that, weak as he had been
in this affair; nay, wicked as he had been, he was
naturally
a good man, and well fitted to make thee happy.
I know that he meditated terrible thingsI know it; for
he sat up all one night; and his face was tremendously
stern and pale. That was the crisis. He forgave me
it was after he had seen your husband.
But your husband died. I am revengeful, but I am
generous. My mother was a Spanish woman. I
inherited
her hot blood. But my father was an Englishman,
an honour to his country. I inherited his lordly nature.
It was time for
me
, now, to do
my
part. I thought of it,
long and long, before the news of your husband's death,
came to me. But that determined me
that!
---I took the
remainder of that very poison, which I had given to
Edward
,
three years before. That done, I sent for him, and
told him
all
. He was frightfully agitated, at first; but,
in a little whileaccursed thoughtit appeared to me,
that he was thinking, already, of his reward. I could
read
Juliet
, in his very eyes. But, witnesses were near;
and I told him, in vengeance, as much as in honesty, that
he had been the husband of a mad woman. He affected not
to believe me. But, the blow went home---home! I felt
his heart staggerand heard the blood rush out of it, as
I whispered the truth in his ear. Pity me, Juliet; pity
me. I was born for something better than I am. Pity
me!
But I had written thisall but the few last lines.---
Them, I have now added, while he and your cousin, are
now whispering in the next room; and my girl is at the
door. All is now overthey are returningone
moment
,
Juliet! I could have loved thee, dear; nay, I
do
love
thee, even at this moment. Farewell!farewell!
Remember, that my guilt is one of madness, and of love.
Canst thou understand it? Thou canst! O, how he
used to talk of thee in his sleepit was hard to bear,
JulietbutbutI forgive theeand bless thee!
HELEN.
GRENVILLE TO HIS WIFE.
No. IIIEnclosed.
This will be given to you, my dear Juliet, only in the
event of my death; an event, which, I am sure, is much
nearer than either has been dreaming of. Read it,
therefore, as the last confession of a dying man; a
husband
,
too, to his wife; the father, it may be, of a babe
already born to thee;and, if thou canst, dear, forgive
him.
To obtain thee, Juliet, I permitted a system of cruelty
and perfidy to continue, long and long after I came to
the knowledge of it. For this, my love, my reverence,
my passionate tenderness for thee, are no excuse. But,
I had not the heart to break up a conspiracy; and betray
the plotters of thy ruin into thy hands, while I saw so
much probable advantage to myself, in permitting it to
continue. Nor is this all, Juliet. I participated, not
only by my silence; but, actually, with my countenance
and behaviour. For this I do repent me, bitterly, in
dust and ashes. This it is, Juliet, that has troubled my
sleep, even at thy side;this, that has fevered and
parched
my lips, and sunk my temples; dimmed my eyes;
and turned my black hair gray, within one little year.
What has it not cost me to conceal my own villany!
Much that thou believest real, of the perfidy, cruelty and
baseness of Molton, is false;more of it is so
discoloured
and distorted, that it is no longer the same; and many
times, dear, when thy tears have fallen upon my arm;
and thy bosom hath heaved, unsteadily, all the live long
night, when both were pretending to be asleep, have I
heard or fancied, that the movement of thy sweet lips,
had the sound of Molton in itand then, I have been,
more than once, on the point of throwing myself upon
my knees, and avowing it alljust as I did to
him
,
immediately
after our marriage. From that hour, the
secret
hath been in his keeping. While I lived, it would
have remained there, unless in some moment of
confidence
,
when thou wast sleeping, to thy thought, in the
bosom of an honourable manmy heart had burst with
itand let it out, together with its blood, upon the spot.
How I have borne it, God only knows:to feel thy
caresses; thy tears; thy affectionate touch; and see thy
gentle eyes lighting up at my approach; and to know
that I was unworthy of theeO, it has, many and many a
time, driven me to treat thee capriciouslyas if I had no
heart for such luxury:to rebuke thee, by my coldness;
and even to hurry away from whatwas death to me
caresses, that I felt, were meant to be lavished, upon what
I was
not
an honest man.
It may be, dearest Juliet, my wife! my beloved! that, in
time I should have had the courage to tell thee all;
and it may be, that thou would'st have loved me still.
The father of thy children; thy companion for many years;
a penitentI could not have been utterly contemptible
in thy eyes. But.
But heaven hath ordered it wisely. I am at death's
door. One stepand I enter. And when I am gone,
Molton, that inexplicable man, whose worst fault is a
bold, hazardous frankness; and disdain of prejudice,
he
will bear this to thee. Nayhe will put it into thy
hands to remain, when we part; with permission to open
it, in case of my deathand under no other condition.
My last advicedearest of womenis this:forget
meforgive meand give thyself up, when it may be,
if heaven, shall so order it, to
him
who hath so long, and
so devotedly, loved thee. The event is distant;
impossible
perhaps; but I cannot help dreaming of it, as one
that must happen, eventually, for the reward of such
sublime affection, as that of your two hearts hath been.
Farewell! Juliet---Farewell! The property that I leave
to thee, is altogether thine. The proper steps have
already
been taken to secure to thee, an honourable
independence
.
If the babe should livethere is only one
man to whom I would entrust its education, if it be a
boy
thy heart will tell thee who that is. I have heard him
reason much upon the subject; and I know that he has
thought much upon it. If a
girl
to thee, Juliet; and to thee
alone, do I commit her. Heaven bless thee, my wife;
my dear one!
Farewell!
GRENVILLE.
P. S. I have read it over again. It does'nt express
a single thought, of the hundred that agitate me. I
have no talent for writing, nor for conversation;but
I can
feel
, Juliet; I can feel that I have been a scoundrel;
that I have cheated thee; conspired against thee; and
wronged an honest man, beyond the reach of reparation.
Let me do him the last justice in my power. The fact
which I communicated to thee, the very evening before
our marriage
that
, which so shook and terrified thee
was never told by him. I made thee believe
then
, that it was.
That was worse than lying. It was full as baseand more
dastardly. I know not how it was betrayed; and
Molton
stood like one thunderstruck, when I mentioned it.
By my hopes of salvation, he said, I never breathed
that secret, into the ears of mortal mannor woman,
nor child. I never committed it to paperand I know
not, by what supernatural intelligence, it can ever have
been known. She must have told it herself! But no
that were impossible! Enough, JulietI can say no
more. How these things were known; I cannot imagine;
Molton, himself, cannot imagine; but, I would risk my
life; or the little that remains of it, while I am writing
this, that Molton never spoke of thee, in his life, but with
the most devout tenderness. Judge then, if he could
ever have ridiculed thy gentleness; profaned the secret
of thy heart; told when and where you had met; and how
you hadno, it is impossible!
FarewellFarewell!
SARAH TO RANDOLPH.
The man, Molton, has had the presumption to write to
me; and that too, proudly; as if I were a woman, to be
wrought upon, like the infatuated Juliet. I shall reply
to him, merely for the purpose of advancing my suit
with him. It was more than two weeks ago; and, weak
as I am, I cannot delay it longer. O, Randolph, had
you known that woman! so gentle, so uniform, so gifted!
with such lofty and heroick principle; and yet, so
blinded
,
and carried away, by the fascination, of that man.
I have received some letterssome, that, were it any
man but Edward Molton, whom they concern, would
almost tempt me to believe him innocent. But, how can
I? Come to me, Randolph. I cannot answer your last
letterI shall not. The storm has changed my nature.
I feel a growing sullenness, and darkness, and
collectedness
,
that I never had before. My own transgressions
wane, before those of the most perfectly virtuous woman,
that I ever knew. I look in upon my own heart, and I
wonder
at it. The plague spots, there, are fiery and
sanguine
;
but, even
her
heart is not sound. What, Juliet!
dear Julietlook down upon me! let thy tears fall
upon them!Even thy heart was not utterly pure!
Death weakened it. Thou didst take counsel of thy
weakness, and thy womanhood; and admit a man to thy
husband's sanctuaryand such a man!Enough!My
errand is now, of another nature. I would have you
find out Molton, if he be on the face of this earth; and
give him this letter; and pray him; entreat of him, to
yield up the babe to me. I will be a mother to it. It shall
bear
his
name. I will even consent to
that
. Nay, I
will permit him to see it, when he pleasesto share, if
he will, in the expenses of its educationand, when old
enough, if it must be, I will relinquish its guardianship,
entirely to him. Bring me the boy, Randolphnever
leave him, till he consentsnever see me, without him.---
I care not, at what sacrifice. Juliet shall find, that there
is
one, upon the earth, that truly loved her.Let me see
you
, too, as soon as possible. Nay, there are.But,
no matter. This commission executed, I have then,
another for you. Take the babe and nurse, into your
own hands. I have been too long asleepI begin to
awake. I have duties to perform; and I am determined
to perform them.
SARAH RAMSAY.
SARAH RAMSAY TO EDWARD MOLTON.
The tone of your letter, sir, would deserve reproof;
but, sorrow and humiliation have taken down the pride
of my heart; and taught me to
hope
, where I cannot
believe
in the honour and uprightness of another. I have
little
to say to you; but you have, at least, one virtue; and
to that, alone, I address myself. You are
frank
, and
direct; heaven knows for what purpose; but such, I
believe
,
is the fact. Let me be so, too. I do not think
well of you. I never shall. Nothing that can ever
happen, during the lapse of many years, can change my
opinion of you.
You loved my friend, Juliet. I cannot understand
howbut, the fact appears to be certain. I loved her,
too. She has entrusted you with her babe. I am
legitimately
entitled to it. It was blindness and delusion in
her, alone, that led her to confide a charge, so precious,
to one; of whom, she, poor innocent, knew so little that
was unequivocally good. You may be an injured man,
sir. I would fain believe that you are. But, until that
vol. ii. C c
appears; and I cannot see how it
should
appear, until all
hearts are laid open for judgment, before God, I cannot
consent to hold any correspondence with you. You see
that I am very plain. I would save trouble. I would
have this letter effectual; and the last, that I shall ever
have occasion to address you. I wrote to you, once before.
Have you forgotten it? My opinion is unaltered; and,
though you may be an innocent and abused man; yet, it
is certain, that you have an evil reputation.
That
alone,
should disqualify you for the important, the sacred
charge of education. Would you taint the babe, from
its very birth? Mr. Molton, I address you as a
man
good or bad, I care not, at this moment; but, as a
man
I ask you, if you would not yield up that child, if
you were visited by pestilence, or contagion?It might
not be your faultit would be merely your misfortune;
but, would you breathe into that child the poison?
Your
reputation
would be as fatal to thewill
you give up the child?You will. I am rejoiced, for
once, to
believe
well of you. You
will!
I am very humble
very;
but, the occasion demands
it. Else, I could not sue to one, that, to this moment, I
feel a strange, deep antipathy toward. I use no disguise.
The conditions, you will name. Let them be as easy as
you can. But, whatever they are, they will be
religiously
observed by
me
.
The gentleman, who hands you this, is named
Randolph
.
He is a particular, and dear friend of mine.
You will be perfectly safe, in making any arrangement
with him, respecting the maintenance of the nurse and
babe; but, if you will, I should be particularly gratified,
if you would leave the matter entirely to me.
Sincerely praying for your reformation,
I remain,
Sir, &c.
SARAH RAMSAY.
RANDOLPH TO SARAH.
I have obtained the child. It is now in my house,
together
with its nurse. The enclosed note is directed to
you: and, I have just received some remarks upon the
education
of children; which, at some future day, are to be
submitted to you. He thinks of leaving the country: and
if so, these regulations, if there be any good in them,
may be of value. He is in very bad health: and,
has the appearance of one, kept alive, and in motion, by
a continual effort. If he rest, for a moment, he becomes
immovable. A settled melancholy is upon him; and, he
appears sufficiently conscious of his danger, to make
considerable exertion, for the re-establishment of his
health;and yet, as if it were a matter of duty, rather to
others, than to himself; for, there is a cold, continual,
phlegmatick indifference about him, in every movement.
He read your letterwas silent, for some moments; and
then wrote, with a pencil, the following billet; adding,
at the same time, that the child and nurse should be
ready
for me, in two hours, if they were
well
. In two
hours, precisely, a carriage stopped at my door; and
they appeared. To-morrow, or next day, I shall set
out for New York, when I hope to show you the
loveliest
little creature, that you ever set your eyes upon.
SPENCER RANDOLPH.
(NOTE ENCLOSED.)
I love frankness. I make no conditions. The child
is yours. Had you flattered me, you would not have
prevailed. As it is, you had well nigh
lost
, by one
sentence
,
that resembled flattery.

FRANK TO JOHN.
Baltimore
.
How are you?my dear brother, how are you?
Surely
you have expected me; and, as this was about as likely a
port, as any, to bring me up, I had a right, I think, to
look for a letter from you. Yet I find none. I am in
rather extravagant spirits, I confess. The idea of
seeing
you, and Sarah, and JulietStay, the servant
appears
at the doorhe tells me, that, if I wish to send
my letter by to-day's mail, I have not a moment to lose.
So farewell, awhile. To-morrow, I shall write to you,
again; and, perhaps, the next day, follow my letter, in
person. I have a good deal to do for Sarah, here.
FRANK.
P. S.Remember me to Mrs. Grenville, with all my
heart and soul. She did not go to meet her husband,
after
all, then?
SAME TO SAME.
I wrote to you, yesterday. I shall be detained, I fear,
for a whole week. The thought is painful to me; and I
have half a mind, to jump into the stage at once; gallop
on to you, and shake hands all round; andthen come
back again, with my teeth chattering. But I cannot
this business must be done now, or never. I can give
you some idea of it; but you will keep it close from every
body, and particularly from Sarahnay, you may as
well tell it to JulietMrs. Grenville, I meanit may
make her happier, a few hours in advance of the rest;
and who could forbear such a temptation?thatthat
faith, I hardly know where I am; but the amount of it
is, that Sarah is a fortune. after all. But what is to
become of her? Will she do for you, John? What a pity
that so much wealth, and spirit, and
beauty
, (
she
may
happen to see this letter, you know, John, one day or
other
,)
should go out of the family. I can't bear to think
of it; particularly, after all the trouble that I have had;
as all the four winds of heaven can testify. You see that
my old nature has returned to me. How could it be
otherwise, John? Nature will not be changed; and,
though she may get, now and then, confoundedly
frightened
;
and become serious and good, in consequence, yet
she will
laugh
, at last; and sin anew, after the cloud
hath gone over. By the way, that reminds me of
Molton
.
Where is he now? What is he? I shall ask you
a good many questions, now, though you will have no
opportunity to answer them; and I
know
thatmerely
to kill timejust as people laugh out, when they are
just ready to cryor whistle, for want of thoughtor
sing when they are frightenedorBut let us return
to Molton. I heard a pleasant thing of him the other
day. He has made poetry, I am told; and he affects to
resemble Byron. Yes, it is very true!---and he really
has the vanity to imagine, that he has a Greek face!---
Can you imagine anything more ridiculous? He had
been confoundedly frightened by a sudden illness. A
lady
that I know, was speaking to him of it. Yes, said
he, I began to think of a reformation---and, had the fit
continued, there is no knowing how good I might have
been. That would have destroyed your
resemblance
to Byron, said she. Was'nt it severe, brother?home,
home, was'nt it? But he never suspected the sarcasm.
He took it for a compliment, and bowed. What a fool!
Yet he has a strange influence over me. At the very
sound of his name, my veins beat and swell; and I feel a
sense of suffocation and tightness about the heart, quite
distressing to a heretick.
O, you have heard of the
Delphian Club
. I was
there, last nightit was a sort of gala with them; and
never was it my misfortune, to see such a heap of
intellectual
rubbish and glitter, in all my life. There were
ten or a dozen of them; and the chief entertainment of
the societynay, their chief wit, appeared to consist in
calling each other by hard names. I can remember some
of them, I believe; for I whipped out my memorandum
book, and wrote a few of them down, slilybut they are
vol. ii. C c 2
partly defaced now. There was a Mr. Opechanganough
Oligostikiss; Precipitate Parquin; Bocgin Jokcullus;
Hebti Glott; Pertinax Foncrambogroff, the president,
andO, it is impossibleI cannot make out their
names; but I can give you some notion of their
characters
,
and the spirituality of their entertainment. There
are about a dozen of them, though their number is
limited
to nine. They call themselves the
he
-muses. And
each one has a companion allotted him, from among the
nine
she
-ones. Each man has a
clubicular
name, as
they call it. The members read essays; chase puns,
through fire and smoke, so long as they can perceive a
scintilla juris;
wrangle vehemently, and noisily, about
nothing; talk all together; and eat, when they do eat,
which, I should judge, could not be oftener than once a
week, with inconceivable effect; and drink after the
same manner.
First, there was an essay read, by one of the members;
a very substantial, good thing; over which, the best
natured
gentleman that ever I clapped eyes on, went fairly
to sleep, with the happiest countenance in the world. I
set him down for a stupid fellow, at once; but I was
bitterly
mistaken. He was really witty and prompt; he
did'nt say muchand, what he did say, was in epigram;
one, out of three, that he gave that evening, and they all
arose from events that occurred in the room, while we
were talking, was about as neat and piquant a thing,
as can be found in our language. Then a light haired
fellowa
light headed
one, I should sayby heaven, his
voice is ringing in my ears yetthe noisiest, most
vociferous
devil, that ever I met withtold a storyfor
which he was fined;this produced a quarrelsome
ribaldry
some
debating---a reference to the records---the
constitution---and a motion to clear the galleries;---that
is, as I took it, to throw the visiters out of the window.
The hot little fellow was, at length, appeased. Some
poetry was offered---pretty good, I thought---then there
was a dash at politicksa knock from the president's
hammerwhen the theme was changed, with a laugh,
to religiona louder knockand a general uproar, as
if it was grog-time with the builders of Babelthen,
some indications of boxing. It was proposed to fight a
duel. Done, said one. I acceptchoose my weapons.
Very wellwhat are they? Two
fore
pounders, he
replied
,
showing his
two
pounders.
Then there was an essay read upon some Babylonish
bricksthen a story about Dr. Mitchell; which, I am
sure, is trueand it is really too good a thing to be lost.
Rememberit is a literary club; and they affect to
make such men as Alexander, and Napoleon, and Julius
Csar, honorary members!and have actually sent
diplomas
to some of the throned banditti of Europe.
Another of their regulations, that pleased me not a
little, was this. When a member rose to speak, the
president
pulled out his watch, and limited the time, at
which he
must
stopand
to
which he
must
go, under a
penalty. The effect was irresistibly ludicrous. One fine
fellow, full of fire and heartwith a good deal of the
devil in him, I should think(an eminent advocate
here)was the first victim. His eyes were on the watch
[29]
[29]
A pun quite
unintentional
, I am sure. He would have been fined among the
DELPAIANS
.
Ed.
---and his sentences were so pleasantly tagged together---
spun outrepeated, and dove-tailedtill the three
minutes
were out, that---thatno matter. Then we had
some
poetry
---one stanza of which, I remember. It was
deliberately recited, as Pindarick, by the Secretary; a
Dutchman, that wears spectacles; talks through his nose;
but writes better blackguard, in reality, than Coleman
himself. Judge of the effect from a solemn annunciation of
such stuff as this!
Brief let me be;
For brevity
Is the
Soul of
Wit.
And then there followed a story. Stay---I'd like to
have forgotten Dr. Mitchell. There was a boy here,
about twelve or fourteen years old, the son of the fat
sleepy gentleman, before mentioned; or, of the president,
as I was told; who, of his own head, wrote a letter to
Dr. Mitchell, last summer, announcing that a society
was just established in Baltimore, called the
Newtonian
Society
; and that they had, unanimously, elected
him
an honorary member; and added, that any
communication
,
from him, would be acceptable to the society, &c.
It was signed by some outlandish name, as secretary.
The boy forgot the name; and did not know for whom
to inquire; until he saw the letter advertised. It was from
the credulous old gentleman. I saw it. It was in his
own hand-writing; and was, really, a speculation on
matters
and things, in generalalluvion; organick remains;
and secondary formations, etc. etc.; with the Doctor's
compliments to the Newtonian Society; and information
that he was going, that very night, to a confederacy of
a like character, in New-Yorkto which he should
communicate
the rapturous intelligence, &c. &c.
But the best of the joke was to come. This piece of
childish pleasantry, soon took a new shape. It was
only
known to the boy, (for he was afraid to tell his father;)
to the
light headed
man; and to Dr. Mitchell. The first
kept it a secret, for his own sake; the second, out of
compassion to Dr. Mitchell. But lo! the Doctor was not
so discreetfor it was soon after announced, in the
Washington Gazette, that Dr. M. was appointed
honorary
member of the Newtonian Society of Baltimore!
And this very evening, a book is abroad, containing the
remarkable events in Dr. M's. life, under his own hand;
in which, the hoax, date and all, are distinctly recorded.
Upon my word, it is a shame.
To this, then succeeded a story, thatthough you never
smiled before, John, I am sure you will smile at, if you
have never heard it. It is about the neatest thing that I
remember
;
and it cost the teller twenty-five cents for
telling
itit having been seen in print, by some other
member
.
A Frenchman was travelling, on a close sultry
day, with a newly married lady. The curtains were
down. She complained of the heat. The curtains were
raised. Some passenger spoke to her; and warned her
against the sun, that was beating down upon her head.
O, I suppose, said the Frenchman, dat de ladi would
radder ave a leetel
son
, as no
heir
at all! Did you ever
see more effectual punning upon the words
air
and
sun
?
I ask this question, you know, to avoid the mortification
of explaining the joke. It will make you look at it,
again.
To this succeeded some tolerable punning, for which,
to my notion, the whole company deserved to be
intolerably
ahem!I
dont say what, but I was provoked to
see such men so employed.
Then there was a dispute about poetry, and wit;and a
furious altercation followed, in which the president swore
positively, that, he'd be damned, if there were a man
in all Philadelphia, that knew the difference between the
sound of the
w
and
v!
nay, that, when the people
heard
it there, they could not distinguish the difference. It was
said very seriously. Another gave some illustrations,
that amused me, from the Spanish, in their confusion of
the
b
and
v: d
and
t;
and also in the German. But a
tall man, in black, took it up; and, quoting chapter and
verse at him, amused me a good deal, with his soberness
and phlegm, and closeness.
Then there was another squabble, in another quarter,
into which I popped my head.
Stop John, let me look at my watchhalf past ten
yes,I'll finish with the Delphians.
That was about some new poema law booka
popular
preacherand the pronunciation of
in
in the
French words
inutile
, intrigue. The president, off hand,
decided that it was sounded
alike;
and, I confess, that
his arguments were
unanswerable
. But the practice is
settled. I am sorry for itfor it is a mighty pity where
one is very positive, to have the
fact
contradicting him
flatly. But thenso much the worse for the fact,
you know.
It was then maintained, that the neatest repartee in
our language;and the truest specimen of wit, on
account
of its simplicity, and its capability of being
rendered
into all languages, was this. A gentleman
encountered
a blackguard fellow. The latter took the wall,
saying, as he did so, I don't permit every dd
scoundrel
to take the wall o' me!
But I do!
said the gentleman, and gave it to him.
Here was a general hourra Joe! Joe! Joe! They all
shouted at oncefine him! fine him! fine him! Another
debate followed; more argument; some wit; some
pleasantry
and
a great deal of noise and nonsenseand
then, there was a volunteer essay from the white headed
man, in which he took up Mr. Taylor's
unanswerable
demonstration
, and proved, from the author's own
showing
that
Sir Philip Frances
could not have been Junius
.
I was amazed at the effect produced by
his
arrangement
of the same facts. The cluball shook their heads, but
whether in contradictionor drowsiness, I wont say.
[30]

That essay ought to be preserved; for, when it was written, there was no sort of doubt
in the publick mind, about the identity of Junius, and Sir Philip Frances.
Ed.
And so passed the evening. We had a good supper,
and some rational conversationbut God preserve me,
dear John, from the company of professed witsand
anybody, and everybody, indeed, where people meet
together
to say smart things.
Do you remember Harriet?I saw her last evening.
Poor creature! my heart bled for her. I knew that she
was here; but there was much difficulty in seeing her.
She was ashamed and afraid to meet me; and, when she
came to me, she fell upon my bosom and sobbed, as if her
heart would break. Is there any way to save her? Let
us think of it. I had a long conversation with herbut
I dared not remind her of our childhood. It would have
broken her heart. She is very beautiful; more so, than
ever, I think; but perhaps her shame, and her streaming
eyes---can it be, John, that such a womanO, heaven
and earth!a woman that might have been
my
wife
---I wept with her. Yes, John, we must save her. Do you
know how she was corrupted?
It is a strange taleher visit was one of piety
mistaken
to be sure, but the holiest and purest in nature.
She was one of a religious society, who had been put up
to a most perilous charity, no less than that of
penetrating
into the haunts of profligacy, lewdness and death, and
purifying them. Gracious God! that the young and
innocent
should venture amid the pestilence. Would they
hope to reanimate, and cleanse them that are sore all over
with disease and rottenness; by putting their own naked
hearts to them? Yet
that
were as rational. Would they
reach out a hand, where their own footing was slipperyor
less steadfast than the everlasting oak, to preserve, one
who was heavier than themselves?unaided and alone?
Would they take into their innocent companionship,
one that carried a mortal contagion in her breath---nay,
in the very sound of her voice, and the movement of her
eyes and limbs---in the hope of purging it away, and
diluting
the poison, by their tears, when the atmosphere of
heaven, itself---had only quickened it?
The effect was natural. She was pursued---watched
---and fell. How could it be otherwise? That woman
is in peril, who looks upon a picture that is lewd, even
when alone; but her peril is inconceivably heightened, if
a man
know
that she is looking upon it; and if she
know that
he
knows it. But she is lost---for ever and
ever, if they look upon it,
together
. And what picture
would so madden and drug the heart, as the living
creatures
thatno matter---she fell.
We walked together. Such an evening! It was just
about sunset---and there was a surging lustre about all
the horizon, as if all the riches of heaven had been
washed
up against it. It reminded me of our childhood---
of that eveningbut no, I must forget all my past
life---
all
ah John! John!
By the way: I am somewhat anxious about Sarah.---
Are there any suitors?She must have some. You
may as well answer me; for, who knows but I may be
here long enough to get your letter; and it will be such
a comfort to me---beside if I go away, it will follow me
---and I may get it in Philadelphia.
Do
write; will you?
And Juliet too---faith John, I can trifle no longer---
how is
she?
ha!---a drop of blood falls upon the paper!
But so, it has always been, ever since we parted. At
first, I had spasms of the heart, whenever I thought of
her; but that is past. Now my nostrils only drop
with bloodHow is she? Does she ever speak of me?
Is she happy?any family?remember me to her;---I
revere that woman, brother---would thatbut no
matter; I shall soon see her, and be happy. What
prevented
her from going with Mr. Grenville? Her
situation
,
I suppose.
There is another thing. What has become of the old
house? Is it yours? And what is that foolish story about
its being abandoned,
seriously
, because it is
haunted
?
By Jupiter! I should like to sleep in it, awhile. They
tell some pleasant stories, about ghosts that fight there,
after a terrible fashion. I have one, at only the third
hand; but, it is said and
believed
, that, two or three winters
ago, when the house had been shut up, for a long
time; there was a confounded noise of fire and smoke
and wind and thunder;---and that the flames roared, and
the walls shook---andoh, curse such nonsense. Yet
it makes an impression upon the people here. Why is it
not inhabited now? I have half a mind to ride out, and
blow it upif it be only to keep the chambers of my
boyhood
,
free from the pollution of Molton's foot.
Hang it, brotherthere is a feeling here, just hereas
if there were people playing chess in my headthat
infernal
noise last night,
that
is the causeso, I won't
make any calls, this morningI'll spend it in writing to
you. Did you ever observe how much better you
remember
anything, that you have heard questioned, than you
do, what you ought, naturally, to know? Thus I
remember
more of my mathematicks, where I have been
confoundedly
puzzled, and provoked, or floggedthan where
I have gone on smoothlyand thus too, that Molton
haunts me, with a vividness and distraction, at times,
that won't let me sleep.
Is he not a fearful compound? I have thought,
sometimes
,
that he must have some heroick qualities:but
your preposterous admiration and enthusiasm; that blind
and drunken infatuation of yours, have always prevented
me from acknowledging it. There is no shadow,
without
a correspondent light:that, of the sun, is of one sort;
of the moon, another---and the shadow that the stars,
from their littleness, throw out, is hardly perceptible.
One substance may throw many shadows, tooif there
be bright virtues behind it? May we not
hope
, from the
blackness and colossal stature! and depth of the spectre,
that his heart advancesthat he must have a great heart;
and a great light behind it? I do. I never confessed it
before; but I have often
thought
it. I
do
believe it.
I cannot get that girl out of my headthat evening
tooby heaven, the room is full of suffocating fragrance,
at this moment, just as the garden was, when we met.
I have thought of going, seriously, about a profession.
It is really high time, and your indolence and
procrastination
are an admirable lesson for me. What are you
doing
?what
shall I do?--- Stop---that won't answer.---
That is not my way. I'll consult nobody. It is
like calling a council of war. If you conquer, every
one remembers, and tells every word, that he used, to
persuade you to the battle; the glory is shared by all.---
But if you are conquered---
tush
it is quite another affair,
then. They hold their tongues; and the blame is all
your own.
What think you of death, brother? I have been
thinking
a good deal of it, lately. It is no such mighty
matter
,
after all. The
pain
is nothing---I am sure of
that:
the resuscitation however, is not so pleasant, even in
this world---the air rushes into your lungs, like a storm
of powdered glass. But---is it not wise, brother, to
accustom
ourselves, night and day, to the contemplation of
mortality? To die---O, it is a trifle. How quiet and
sweet, the dead sometimes look! I saw a man fall the
other day, on ship-board. A handful of bullets were
thrown into his heart. He never moved again. I
wished
,
in my soul, that it had been my case. I am not fit
to die, John---I know that, well---but a man that is not
fit to die, is not fit to
live
. And it is a dull life that I
am looking to---but not a long one, I hope.
I go out, sometimes, in the open air. I did, last
evening
.
I forgot that Harriet was with me. I felt my
heart at her worship. I looked up---the footsteps of
Jehovah
were all along the sky. I wept---I trembled---and,
if I had been alone, I should have knelt. There was a
blue glimmering all above me, like cold water in the star
light---like the shine of blue waves, away off at sea,
broken
,
shivered, and sparkling, in the wind. It began to
rain and lighten; and we were driven into a house for
shelter. I stood at the window; and it was like a shower
of fire abroad, the big drops of rain, in the lightning.
I felt a gentle pressure upon the arm. I leaned upon
the shoulder of a woman, ere I knew it---heaven! I
might as well have leaned upon hot iron, for all the
support
vol. ii. D d
that there was in it. It was not the bosom of innocence
---no---but it was the smoking and blackened, desolate
place; where the natural fire of the hearth had been
trodden
out; and the flame of destruction kindled in its place.
I shuddered---Harriet spoke of returning. What was
I to do?---I could not talk now of
our
carriage; no, I was
heartily sick of that; and have been, ever since I was at
Washington, where all
our
carriages are hacks; and,
where, after listening, for half an hour, to a fine woman, all
her ostentation, results in thisthat she has been paying
some visits, and treated herself with a quarter of a
dollar's
worth of
our carriage
, in her prodigality. I

not why. It appears to me that the spirits, with which,
I arose this morning, are unnatural, wicked---and, if I

Brother!---I know the whole---the

your letters overtook me this morning---about three hours
ago. I have no more to say---I shall never return to

REV. MR. CARTER, TO MR. JOHN OMAR.
Baltimore
.
Dear Sir
,---A melancholy and distressing duty
devolves
upon me. A stranger, of a genteel appearance,
and youthful, who, I have reason to believe, is a
relation
;
and perhaps, a brother of yours, arrived in this
city, a few days ago. His deportment was dignified;
but there was a strangeness in his vivacity, which, we
were apprehensive, at the first sight, was either
artificial
;
or, in consequence of a temporary alienation of
mind. On Saturday evening, last, I met with him at a
literary society in this town; and felt an uncommon
interest
in him, before we separated, on account of a
certain
nobleness, and manliness in his air; but, before long
on another, and a more solemn account. He was
unhappy
.
I perceived that there was some mysterious
agony, at his heart. He was absent; for his manner,
and his eyes were mute and immoveable, at the very
time, while he appeared to be participating, with all his
soul, in the boisterous merriment of the evening. I
observed
,
too, that he was agitated frequently, as with an
agueand that the sweat came out upon the back of
his hand,---as it rested upon my chair. He affected to
enter into the conversation, with great spirit and zest;
but, I could perceive, that it was painful to him; and his
friend that introduced him, seemed to understand little
of his situation; and I have since found that he has no
other acquaintance with the unfortunate man, than such
as a little business, between them, has given rise to.
I observed, too, that, into whatever position his arms,
or hands fell; in that, they
remained
, until by great, and
even painful exertion, like that which a man may use,
to remove a limb that is asleep, or dead---they were
thrown into a new one. My duties, have led me among
the unfortunate of every class; but I have never
witnessed
a case of more affecting melancholy, than this.
Whether it was one of derangement, or not, I cannot
pretend to say; for that is a visitation which may befall
the wisest, at times,---and this unhappy gentleman,
when deeply engaged, manifested a great collectedness
of thought, and a strong, but undisciplined mind. The
most alarming symptom, that I saw, was the perpetual
flashes of levity, which he threw in, upon whatever
subject
we entered upon. We spoke of death---he was calm,
and grand, for a while---and I felt no common respect
for him---he amazed me, by the awful steadiness of his
mannerit was somewhat preternatural, in one so
young, and, I thought, so given to frivolity. It was
rather
the manner of one, who has made himself familiar with
death; as a philosopher, at least, if not as a christian.
We parted; and, the next day, I took the liberty to
call on him, with the intention of inviting him to spend
the day with my family. I found him somewhat
altered
,
like one that was approaching, every moment, a
place of trial.---I was unaccountably affected. It might
be imagination in me; but it did appear that the ravages
had been carried on, even in the night time;---his lips
were cracking and bloody, with fever; his eyes were
intensely
bright, and full of tears, whenever I permitted
him to be thoughtful for a moment. I feared to intrude
and, it was with a feeling of real distress, that I
mentioned
the object of my visit. Whether he saw my
compassion
,
or not, it would be impossible to say; but, his
manner altered, immediately; and there was a cold, and
haughty positiveness in it, that froze me. He was
writing, he said, and could not, possibly, accept my
invitation.Yesterday morning, about nine, I was
sent for, by the family, and informed, that he had been
found, lying upon the floor, and insensible, with an
open letter in his hand, about an hour before. How
long he had been there, they knew not, with any degree
of certainty; but the servant supposed that, about fifteen
minutes had passed, since he gave him a large letter from
the post office. He was bled; and, after two or three
hours, sat up in his bed, and began writing; but, unable
to continue it, fainted; and lay in a torpor or trance, until
last evening. I had been with him for a moment; but
he would communicate nothing to me. He appeared
grateful for my attention; but signified, peremptorily,
that he must be left alone. Had I thought him so very
ill, as he was, I should have watched with him to the
last hour. But I left him; and, last night, I was called
out of my bed, to visit the family, who were
exceedingly
terrified. There had been no sound in the room for
several hours---and no light. The bell had not rung;
and, though expressly forbidden, the servant,
apprehensive
of some accident, like that of the morning, had, at
last, entered the room with candles. The gentleman
appeared to be asleephe was lying on his side, with
his hands covering his face. But the truth was soon
evident
.
He was dead. The pillow was bloody, and his
hands, too, where they covered his mouth; and, at first,
vol. ii. D d 2
we were apprehensive of some violence to himself; but a
little examination satisfied us, that it was, probably,
a bleeding of the breast, or the rupture of some blood
vessel
.
He had, evidently, died very quietly; for his face
was calmand there was a Bible under his head, with
the leaves folded down, showing that he was prepared for
what happened to him; or, in a
measure
, prepared for
it. It is much consolation, my dear sir, under these
bereavements
,
to know that death did not come
unexpectedly
.
I entreat you to regard this visit of mine, as no
officious
interference. He was a stranger; and it was my
duty to minister to him.
His trunks are in the possession of a gentleman here,
to whom I am indebted for his name. The letter alluded
to, and found in his room, is signed
John;
and the
servant
says, that he put two or three, lately, into the office,
directed to
Mr. John Omar, New York
. I have taken
the liberty to address this to the same person; assuring
him, that his friend, or relation, whose name I find, by
his trunks, and this letter, to be
F. Omar
, has wanted
for nothing; and that the interment will be delayed, for
three or four days longer, that any of his friends, at
Philadelphia, or New-York, may have an opportunity
to be present.
Enclosed is a note, without an address, which I took
the liberty to read, that I might the better understand
where to direct it; together with that which is signed
John. Nobody but myself has read either.
We know not what has been the cause of this
melancholy
affair; but, it is conjectured by the family, that a
very lovely young woman, who was seen here, sobbing and
holding up her hands, two or three nights ago, as she
parted with him, is, in some way or other, connected
with it. We have made some inquiry; but we cannot
hear who, or whence, or what she is.
My duties are now at an end. But I have too much
reverence for sorrow, to obtrude upon a brother, as I am
persuaded that you
are
, my consolation, at such a
moment
.
I can only sayGo to the Biblethe bruised in
heart, and broken in spiritlet them go therewhen
there is no earthly consolation for them.
I am, sir, respectfully, &c. yours
,
THEOPHILUS CARTER.
JOHN TO FRANK.
O, my poor brother!God be merciful to thee!
Before
this, it may be, that thy heart is already shattered into
a thousand pieces. My brother, my brother! how poignant
will be thy suffering! So much pains too, as I had taken
so many lettersall to prepare thee for itand then, to
find thee almost at the doorcheerful and festive
gracious
God!
Yet, it is possible that you have not received any of
my letters; that you do not yet know; not even at this
moment, of the desolation that is encompassing you.
May it be so? Prepare yourselfawaken all your
faculties
go
down upon your kneesimagine the most
tremendous blow that could fall upon youno matter
what it isand thenno, no, my brother; I cannot
tell thee what it
is
, yet. I pity thee. Do not leave
Baltimore
do
not, I charge thee. I have just received thy
little note; and, to-morrow, I shall expect to know
exactly
the truth. If no letter come to-morrow, I shall set
off, myself, for Baltimore. Farewell, my dear,
dear
brother.
Harriot
, too!no, I cannot speak of her,
now
.
JOHN.
P. S.Be prepared for the
worst
the worst that
can
happen to thee, my poor brother. Nothing else
can
save
thee.
JOHN TO FRANK.
I tremble at thy levity, brother. It is unnatural. I
am not much used to weeping; but the pleasantry of thy
long letter, frightens me. I could bear to see thee
sorrowful
,
sternthough I know well, that thy heart was
never made for sorrow or sternness; but this exuberant
festivity is frightful. I know not what to write. That
letter is before me, with the blood upon her name, yet
hers!
O, would that I knew the truth! Does
he
know
it yet?Father of mercies! does he know it? O, if not,
I would pray thee, to seal up his senses for awhile,
until
his brother be near to comfort and sustain him!
To-morrow, I shall certainly set off; nay, I would,
to-day
,
but I know not how I canfor I have an
engagement
of the utmost moment, to the happiness of Sarah.
Let me tell thee what it is. It will enable my brother
to judge of the distraction, under which I labour. Two
human beings; two, that are infinitely dear to me, are
tugging at my heart, at the same moment, upon
opposite
sides. Would that I could divide it between them!
Sarah is imprudent. I cannot stop, to detail the
particulars
;
but she is infatuated with an adventurer, who
has been pursuing her for years, in one shape and
another
.
His name is Randolph. I am to meet him this
evening. Every thing depends upon it. I have some
suspicion that he is the blackest of villains; and, I very
much fear, that Sarah is distractedly fond of him.
Molton
,
I think, knows something of him; and, if it be true,
I would not be in Randolph's shoes for the whole world.
It is about fortnight, since I saw Molton. He is arrived
here, with the intention of going to Liverpool, in the
next packet. He means to see Sarah, before he goes, in
spite of all her prejudices; which, he says, are unnatural
and wicked. Nay, he probably meditates a lesson for
her; and I know no man so likely to give it effect. I have
made him promise to meet me, this evening, at Sarah's.
I want to confront him with Randolph. He does not
know that Randolph is to be there; and I shall take care
to apprise Sarah, only in season for some little
preparation
of mind.
There is now only one thing, in Molton's character,
that troubles me. He is still haunted, night and day, by
some childish apprehension. It will destroy him, at
lastI am sure it will. I reason with himbut he is
so tremendously calm. I ask him if he
can
believe in
apparitions
.
He only smiles. I repeat the questionand
ask if he be
afraid
of them. His eyes flash fire. No! he
saysno!though all the buried population, of the earth,
came crowding around me, at midnight, I would not
avoid them, if I could. But do you
believe
in them? I
say again.
I do
, is always the reply. I believe him;
and I wonder at it. Yet, why should I wonder? Have
I, myself, not heard inexplicable sounds; and will not
my blood thrill, even now, at the recollection of that
room? Why is this? I feel assured, that it was a
delusion
;
yetno, brother, I cannot go on. To see such a
man; at whose touch, systems crumble into dust, and
pass away, like smoke in a high wind; before whose arm,
and stride, the tenantry of the tombs should fall
prostrate
;
to see him quaking all over with shadows;a man,
before whom go a reasoning army, that lay waste and
scatter the best settled doctrines of men;to see
him
yielding to the doubtful and dismaying ones; him, at whose
touch, flowers will spring up, and blow upon the
charnel
houseand the awful features of death, take an
expression
of benignity; from whose tears, as if the colour
of his very eyes went with them, and impregnated the
earththe young violets gush up, about the grave and
turfmaking both of them dear to the heart, and
welcome
to the thought;that
he
should cower and quail
before the
shadow
of death
he
, who fears not the
substance
;
that
he
should lie down and die, with terrour,
before an
unreal
summoner, who would stand erect, to
the blast of a visible Archangel, summoning the world
to judgment. O, to see this, to hear it continually; is it
not enough to unsettle the understandings of menand
take away their very longing after immortality.
Farewell!farewell! Bear up bravely, my brother,
against the trial. The season of trial is the time for the
stout-hearted. There is a child lefta
child
of Juliet.
Let that move thee, brother. Be thou a father to it!
Farewell!
JOHN.
P. S.In two days, I shall be with you. To-morrow
I set outat three o'clock in the morning.
NOTEJOHN TO SARAH.
I have a favour to ask of you, cousin. I have never
asked one, before; and, to-morrow morning, I shall leave
the cityperhaps it will be the
last
that I shall ever ask.
You are in peril. Your prejudices, I say nothing about.
They were always violent; and, though your temper
has grown gentler, and more indulgent, of late; yet,
they were never more violent or unworthy of you, than
at this moment.
Edward Molton is in town. He will sail for England
on the fifteenth; and, if we may trust to appearances, I
do believe that he will never return. He has been an
injured
mana man, more sinned against, than sinning.
I would venture to appeal to your generosity, Sarah
for there is not a more generous creature upon this earth;
but I would not do it, after making that speechI would
not even be suspected of flattery. Nor would I so wrong
my friend, Sarah, as to appeal to your
generosity
, when
all, that we require, is
justice
. What do you
know
of
Edward
Molton, cousin, that is wicked, or mean? What,
at least, that is not repented of? And shall he not be
forgiven?
he
, in whose frame the altercation of his heart
and spirit hath been carried on, till he is ready to give
up the ghost? Let
us
be merciful, if we would expect
mercy. Recall all that he has done. Discharge your
heart of all bitterness toward him; and consent to shake
hands with Edward Molton, once, before his departure,
as you would, even with your mortal enemy, upon his
death-bed. We all have our infirmities, Sarah. You
have yours;at this moment, you are in the most
imminent
peril. I do not name it. I will not so shock you;
but, it is possible that you may yet owe all, that should be
dear to a woman, in this life, to Edward Molton.
Mark me, Sarah. I know my extravagance. I know
my propensity to run from one extreme to another;
through good report, and evil report. I am aware, too,
how often I have called that man accursedand then,
wept upon his bosom; but all these things are no excuse
for you. An hostility so unamiable; so inveterate; nay,
so unnatural, as yours, cousin, is impious. How dare
you entertain it? I speak plainly, dear Sarah, because
I love you; and, because, it is possible that we may not
meet again, till all my solicitude may be useless. Frank
is still in Baltimoreand I shall go on, to-morrow
morning, to meet him; after which, we shall set sail for
some country, where both can be happier. Before I go,
I would be satisfied of one thing. I have reason to
believe
that Molton is the only man, who can satisfy me.
I believe that he knows something more of Randolph
than you do; for his forehead darkens, when I mention
his name. Let them meet,
if you dare
.
My first intention was to surprise you, by leading
Molton upon you, this evening, unexpectedly; and
setting
him, face to face, with Randolph:my next, to give
you a moment for preparation. But that were unworthy
of all. It is neither a reconciliation, nor an atonement,
that is done without deliberation. What say you? He
has a
right
to
demand
an interview; for you have
wronged
him. He has a right to
demand
it, as the constituted
guardian of Juliet's babe; for he ought never to leave
this country, till he have seen it. He loves the little
creature
,
as if it were born of him; nay, with more than a
father's tenderness; and he swears that his last look
shall be upon it, when he embarks, that the image may
be carried with him, nestling in his heart, wherever he
may wander, forever and ever. He has a right, too to take
the child away. But all these things are disdained, by
him. If he meet thee, it must be of thy own free will.
What sayest thou, Sarah?
Sarah, I have only one word more to say. It is worth
your consideration. If you do not permit me to confront
Randolph with Molton, nothing shall ever convince me
that it was not because you were
afraid
. It is hard to
say so, dear Sarah; but it is the truth.
Yours, dear cousin
.
JOHN.
REPLY.
Cousin John
,
At first, I had a great mind to return your letter; and
then, I had almost resolved, when I looked at the
conclusion
,
to send it back, reduced to ashes; with a denial
of your request; and a farewell, that you should
remember
to your dying day. But I put it by, for an hour, till
the tears were dry in my eyesand the blisters upon the
paperand the heat had escaped from my heart. It
was very cruel, Johnbut I forgive you.
I have been interruptedbut you have my consent to
bring Mr. Molton to me,
this evening
. I hope that I
have
wronged him. I sincerely hope it. Convince me
that I have, and I will embrace his knees. But, how
am I to be convinced? There is no power on earth to
do it. Still I shall submit to his presence, hateful as the
thought is, rather thanJohn, my forehead crimsons.
What should I be
afraid
of? What should Randolph be
afraid of? I would not have a quarrel herenay, I
will
not. I have taken care to provide for that. But, be not
too sanguine of the result. Something has happened,
which, if you knew it, would make you a little less
anxious
for the meeting, I apprehend, even on
his
account,
than you are, now. Yes, sirbring this redoubtable
Molton forward. I am ready for the trialanother is
as ready as myself. Let us see who quails in it.
One word more, cousin. You would have me a
hypocrite
a
changeling. I cannot be one. My temper is
constancy. I am not prone to take impressions,
indentures
,
or curvatures, either toward or against my kind,
easily; but, once taken, they are not
easily
obliterated.
What are his crimes?
Can
you ask me? An
uninterrupted
course of profligacy and blood. No more.
How a man, and still less a womana woman, too,
like the blessed Julietshould be so infatuated with the
stern, unrelenting character of such a man, is
inconceivable
to me. But, bring him, cousin;bring him
alongthe sooner the betterand we shall then see who
skulks away from the trial; when the lists are opened,
and the judgment seat unveiled; with the look of
greatest
horrour and affright.
SARAH.
CONCLUSION.
The drama is at an end. The curtain has already
fallen; and, of them that were the actors, only three are
now living. The catastrophelet me relate itI was
present at a part; and the remainder, I have from an eye
witnessa party.
Randolph spent the whole afternoon with Sarah, in
deep and earnest conversation. As the hour of trial
approached
,
his countenance grew darker and darker: and
a deeper intensity of the eye; a steadier, greater
self-collectedness
grew upon him. Seven was the hour
appointed
;
and it was already half past six. There had
been a dead silence for many minutes. Randolph held
Sarah's hand, almost as if he knew it not; and supported
his forehead with the other. His face was in the shade;
but there was a mournful unquiet movement in it, at
times. Was it guilt? And then, there was a death-like
paleness. Was it the flash of the candle?or could it
bepoor Sarah's heart contracted at the thoughtit
might be apprehension. The more that she tried to repel
the cruel visitor; the more obstinately did it returnher
blood felt colda little sweat stood upon her lipsshe
trembledand yet, there was unspeakable tenderness in
her eyes.
E E
Randolph, said she, in a faint voice, ifif
He took her hand. No, love, said he, I
understand
thy thought. I am not
afraid
to meet this man.
She pressed his hand to her lipsand the tears
gushed
out, all at once, like a heavy dew, from her eyes;
and she would have fallen upon his neckbut the bell rang.
Randolph immediately arosefolded his armsand
stood, fronting the door.
It was only a servant from Mr. Omar, saying that he
was detained for a few moments; but would be with
Miss Ramsay, in less than an hour.
Sarah was very thankful for the reprieve. It was as
if all the fountains of her heart had been broken up, all
at oncethey gushed out at her eyes and lips, with all
their hidden tenderness!and she almost fainted upon
his bosom in the tumult of her feeling.
Be composed, love; said Randolph, leading her to
the sofabe prepared. I do not tremble for
myself,
but I do for thee
. Perhaps. He faltered a little;
but she put her hand upon his; and it appeared to
re-assure
him.
Sarah, said he, at last, there was a deaf-and-dumb
mananay, dear, give me both of thy hands, if
thou hast yet, so little command of them
Hast thou thought of
him
lately?
What is the meaning of this?
No matter---please to answer me.
I
have
, many times---but unwillingly---and I know
not why.
Was he very terrible, to thee, Sarah?
Very
.
And very hateful?
said he, in an altered voice.
Gracious God! cried Sarah, starting from the seat---
who are you!---what!
The deaf-and-dumb man!
was the reply.
Thou!---O heavenly father!---She was very faint---
but a sweet smile followed;---with a slight expression
of terrour in her eyes;---and she parted the rich hair
upon his temples---gently, affectionately---and said,
almost
in a whisper.---So long, Randolph---so long hast
thou pursued me---and I knew it not---well! well!---it
was unkind; but I forgive thee. Strange, that I should
never have thought of such a possibility.---More than
once hath my blood thrilled, at some movement of thy
strange eyes---some attitude of thy body---or some sound
of thy voice---but I never asked myself the reason---I
thought t
common
, with them that lovebut let us talk
of that, hereafter.
There was another silence.--She was leaning yet, upon
his bosom, with her beautiful arms locked about his neck
---her dishevelled tresses floating backward, from her
passionate eyes---and revealing her haughty forehead,
invincible yet, but partially subdued, and pale with the
giving out of her spirit.
Sarah, said Randolph, mournfullyis there
nothing
that could shake thy confidence in me?
Nothing!
Then, why is the man Molton summoned hither?---
How knowest thou but he may bear the
proof
, that I am
an unworthy adventurer---a villain?
Randolph! answered Sarah, in amazement. What
ails thee? Thy voice is frightful. Is there any more
mystery?
There is.
Be a man, then; and lay it all, nakedly, before me.
Wilt thou believe Molton, if he should say, that I am
a scoundrel?
Not if he
say
so.
But if he
prove
it---what then? You know nothing
of me---nothing, but what I have chosen to tell of myself.
How know you that I am not all, that?
Spencer Randolph---stop. I will not even permit this;
---he cannot
prove
thee base---my senses will be shut to
all proof. I could say---she smiled---and a tear or two
fell upon his hand, as she held it to her heart---if it were
lawful to quote poetry at such moment, that
I know notI ask not,
If guilt's in thy heart;
I but know that I love thee,
Whatever thou art.
Randolph locked his hands; and elevated them to
heaven. God be thanked; he cried---the hour is now
at hand---all my suffering---all my sorrow are wiped
away. This from
thee
, Sarah---is it wise?is it natural?
is it righteous.
I know not, answered Sarah, meekly---it is
something
,
that I would not have believed once---nay, that I
could
not---but I feel it now, like a religion.---I cannot
doubt thee.---No proof could dishonour thee, or displace
thee, dear Randolph.
Randolph had well nigh fallen at her feet---but he
upheld
himself awhile longer.
What mockery is it, then, to confront me with this
Molton! Is it fair, Sarah?---wilt thou believe that
he
is
a villain, though I give thee the proof.
Will I---!---will I---yes. Randolph, upon
thy
bare
word, unsupported and alone---against
his
oath---but
why does thy countenance change?---why dost thou
cover thy face with thy hands?and what are these
sounds, that I hear?
Gracious God!---such is the judgment of
woman!
---
O Sarah!
What do I hear, Randolph? What am I to understand?
Nothing at present---
nothing
a few minutes, and all
will be revealed.
His voice grew sad and hollowhe impressed a kiss
upon her foreheadPrepare thyself; he said,
that
may be the last impress of my lips upon thy front, love!
the very
last
a few moments more, and thou wilt
awake. Stand up, for a momentlook at these papers
is the hand writing familiar to thee?
She looked at themshriekedand they fell from her
handas if they had been a nest of serpentsshe fainted
Randolph knelt by her, and supported her. She
recovered
Arise,
love, said he, in a whisper,
arise
,
I hear footsteps,they are at hand, and these
disordered
tressesthese looks of wildnessthis
O, speak to me! she cried, kneeling to himtell
me, O, Randolph, art
thou
the author of those letters?
Anonymous, too! I am thunderstruck. Didst thou
know Molton so well?That picture, too!O, it
was
thyself! Juliet, too! She knew thee. I am bewildered.
I know not where I am. Help me up, Randolph. I am
very weak. My head swims. Tell me. Hast thou
known him so long, too?
I have. (The door opened.)
Who
art thou, Randolph? In mercy, tell me.
Who
art thou! and
what?
She stood, pale as a statueher hands locked; and her
form benther wild eyes established, upon his face, as
if the first movement of his lip, was to be life or death
to her.
Mr. Omar entered
alone
.He pausedhe appeared
astonished.Why, how is this? How long have
you
been here? said he. I have been waiting for you. It
is unaccountable. Sarah, where?Gracious God!
What is the matter?
Edward Molton
, speak.
What! What!
cried Sarah, gasping for breath.
Speak! speak! Who is that man? Speak!
That man!It is
Edward Molton!
