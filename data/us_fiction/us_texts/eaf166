PART I.
Virtue belongeth nor to rank nor name
As sacred in cottage held as in the hall'
There
was a rude but pleasant farm-house
situated on the green banks of one of the
pleasant inlets that go meandering from the
Sound far into the verdant bosom of
West-chester
County. It was one story high, with
a broad, steep, moss-covered roof, over which
an old oak spreads its wide branches,
shielding
it the whole day from the summer sun.
An old `stoope' protected the door, and its
rude columns were thickly clad with the
entwiaing
honey-suckle. Each end of the old
black farm-house was also nearly covered,
save where openings had been cut for the
windows, with woodbine and other creeping
plants. There was a neat vegetable garden
at one end of the dwelling and a small
orchard
at the other, with the thatched roof of a
long, low barn, seen in the distance. Before
the door was a sort of lawn, on which the
sheep, geese, turkies, and an old domestic
cow, fed all day. This lawn was between the
house and the pleasant creek, where stood a
gate sheltered by a sycamore tree, through
which the cattle were driven to water. All
around was a scene of pleasant vale and
wood-land
,
with elms and oaks bending low over
the clear deep stream. On the opposite side
were seen several farm-houses with shady
walks along the banks between them, and a
little ways below, on an eminence, was
visible
the white columns of a handsome
country-seat
,
the summer residence of a wealthy New
York merchant, who spent his winters only
in the city, which was twenty miles distant.
The inmates of the old farm-house whose
humble exterior we have described, consisted
of Mr. David Woodhull, a plain farmer, his
wife, and their three daughters, of the respec
tive ages of seventeen, twenty, and
twenty-four
.
David was a hard working man, and
with great industry just managed, as he said,
`to make both ends meet at the year's end.'
He was very good natured, and being always
too tired when he came in at night to dispute
any points with his good wife, she in ensibly
got to have sole authority in his household.
When David had been married twenty-five
years he found that he was a cypher in his
own family. Mrs. Woodhull managed every
thing as if she were in reality a widow.
David
only did the farm's worka sort of
wage-less
slave, whom Mrs. Woodhull allowed
lodging
and food for his support. Such
undisputed
power lodged in the hands of a wife soon
exercised its peculiar influence over her habits
and temper. From a pretty, pleasant young
country bride, as she was when David first
took her to wife, she gradually, with the
possession
of power, became imperative and
absolute
.
Contradiction from David or from
the three dear pledges of their `mutual love,'
she could not endure with patience.
By-and-by
Mrs. Woodhull grew old and plain and
this affected her temper. She was now cross
from morning 'till night, and poor David
found no peace save in the field or barn. At
the time of our story the character of the lady
was established through the whole country as
a shrew of the first water. `Poor David
Woodhulldon't he lead a life of it!' were
the ejaculatory expressions of sympathy he
received when the subject was spoken of by
his sympathizing neighbors.
If David, the rightful lord and master, `led
such a life of it,' what kind of a life led the
three daughters over whom the mother had a
legitimate right to rule! And Mrs.
Woodhull
did not shrink from availing herself of
this right. She ruled her children with a rod
of iron. Never were poor girls kept under
such strict severity. They were waked each
morning, winter and summer, with the dawn
by her scolding uproar, and all day long
worked
beneath her eye to the music of her tongue.
The eldest daughter, Euphrosia, was
twenty-four
and unmarried. It is true nature had not
bestowed on her thin person many of those
charms that attract the other sex. Her hair
was not red but sorrel colored; her face not
dimpled but freckled; her eyes a greyish blue
with pink edges; her neck skinny and her
bust flat and bony; her waist, to be sure, was
very, very small, not one inch larger round
than her neck; her hands would have been
admired doubtless in a collection of
anatomical
specimens, and her feet were excellent
matches for her hands. Her nose was turned
up and the corners of her mouth down. She
spoke always to beaux with a simper and a
pucker and a general sympathizing
movement
of her whole body. She thought
herself
very beautifulfor fat people were her
aversion, it was so vulgar to be fat! Of course
thin people were her delight, and she
delighted
in herself particularly. One quality she
had however, respecting which all who knew
Miss Euphrosia had but one opinion. This
was her temper. It was her mother's
double-distilled
the
concentrated essence, as the
quack's advertisements have it when they
would forcibly express the strength of their
nostrums. If Mrs. Woodhull was cross,
Euphrosia
was crosser. She did not, however,
begin to manifest her peculiar disposition,
(save, us will be seen, to her youngest sister,)
'till she found that she was waning an
unwedded
maid.
Sally, the second daughter, was, in her
elder
sister's opinion, very homely, inasmuch as
she was very fat. In person she was the very
antipode of Miss Euphrosia. She was a short,
thick, fleshy, good-natured creature, whom her
mother's scolding or her sister's malice could
never put out of temper. She had her
fathers
disposition, and like him received a
shower
of both their ill will. Though not
handsome
,
Sally was very good-looking with her
black hair, red round cheeks, and pleasant
smile, which displayed fine white teeth. But
her bare arms were brown and brawny, and
her foot was like that of an ox.
Biddy or Bridget the third daughter, was as
unlike either of her two sisters as a ripe,
luscious
peach is like a squash or a red pepper.
She was just seventeen and a perfect rustic
beauty. Her hair was a dark brown, and
curled
beautifully all about her brows and adown
her rounded neck. Her eyes were black and
piercing, in the depths of which love
unfledged
,
lay covert. Her lips were pliant coral,
richly contrasting the beautiful setting of her
pearly teeth which were displayed by the
brightest and most beaming smile in the world
a smile that emanated from a glad pure heart
and bold browand bright was the sun of the
soul within to shine forth so radiantly upon
the face. She was just seventeen, and all the
charms of womanhood were ripening in her
personthe eloquent eye, the modest walk,
the subdued smile, with the sweetly full bust,
and rounded waist, and symmetrical foot, all
betrayed that the spring of womanhood was
just deepening into the warm and glowing
summer. There was also a quiet dignity and
a firmness of manner in her, rarely found with
one so young and naturally and wholly
ignorant
of the world. She was a girl of good
sense, but of a high spirit. From the time her
personal charms had attracted the notice of
the farmer's lads around and at church and
gathering drew on her eyes of all the rustic
beaux, which was about a year before our
story commenced, she had brought upon
herself
the envious ill-will of her eldest sister,
who from that moment became her
persevering
tormentor, annoying her in a thousand
ways and making life itself miserable to her.
Biddy had penetration enough to know the
cause, and bore her ill-humor and overbearing
tyranny with extraordinary patience,
illustrating
twenty times a day the truth of the
beautiful
adage, `a soft answer turneth away
wrath'that is, in her case, by turning it aside
from affecting her own temper and spirit
She could have born this and also her
mother's
unnatural treatment which grew severer
as Biddy grew handsomer, and which at las
reached so far that she forbade her attending
church or even leaving the house for several
weeks previous to the time with which we
have to do. But she had unfortunately
chanced
to make an enemy of her sister Sally, who
charged her with having tempted her stout
and honest sweetheart, John Burn, from his
allegiance and making him fall in love with
her instead. It is true that John's heart was
one Sunday set on fire by the blaze of an
accidental
glance of Biddy's bright eyes, and
from that day he could think of nothing and
talk of nothing but Biddy, quite forgetting
that such a person as Sally Woodhull was in
existence. He finished his madness by
sending
Biddy a boquet composed of scarlet
poppies
,
water-lilies, mari-gold and pea-blossoms.
Sally discovered this act of treachery to her,
and instead of visiting with her vengeance the
culprit himself, she poured the fury of her
fleshly indignation upon the unoffending
Bridget. This was the first time Sally was
ever known to show temper. But a sage
philosopher
very sensibly has asked, `what will
not an aggrieved woman do, especially when
injured in her devout affections?'
Thus Biddy's domestic relations became far
from agreeable. Euphrosia disliked her from
envy, Sally from jealousy, and her mother
because it was her cross nature to do so. It
was, therefore, very unpleasant for her to
remain
in doors and be the foot-ball of their
several
humors. Every disagreeable duty was
put upon her, and she could perform nothing
that could please either of the three.
`Here, you trollop,' cries the mother, in a
shrill octave, `that cat's got into the cupboard
and spilt the cream. If I catch you to let the
cat get in there again I'll trounce you within
an inch of your life, if you was a grown
married
woman, as you never shall be so long
as I have any work for you to do at home.'
`Come, you Biddy,' bawls Miss Euphrosia,
in a cross, spiteful tone, `and wash up this
water I've slopped, if your lady-like hands
an't too fine to touch the floor-cloth. When
you've done it go out and bring in some wood.
Tramp, quick, minx!'
`What are you looking out o' the windur
there for,' cries Sally from the churn, seeing
Biddy pause in carryin a bucket of water to
glance at a boat rowing on the creek; `you
needn't think it's that fool, John Burn, coming
to bring you any more yaller and red flowers.
I gave John a lesson that day, 'ill keep him in
his senses a while I guess Yes, you may
laugh, but I guess John Burn knows who's
substantial pretty and who isn't, if he
was
beguiled
one time from his true duty. Come
along and take this churn and scour it out
clean.'
Thus passed the wearisome days of slavish
toil to poor Bridget. She sighed and
patiently
endured her servitude. But she had a
secret
solace in her lot. It chanced, that one
sultry afternoon in July, two months before
the time of our tale, that David was in a hur
ry to get his hay in, before a storm, which was
swiftly rising from the south-west, should
overtake it in the field. He sent to the house
for Sally to come and help him.
`Humph,' said Sally, tossing her head;
`let Miss Bridget go; she'll may-be find
some flowers in the field to send John Burn.'
`Yes, let her go,' chimed in Miss Euphrosia;
`and don't let her wear her sun hata little
tanning won't do her delicate complexion any
harm.'
So Biddy was sent to the hay-field and
bare-head
,
Euphrosia withholding her broad straw
hat. But what more beautiful covering than
her brown tresses could be desired? She,
however, had some care for her complexion,
and when she reached the field she playfully
removed the straw hat from her father's head
to her own, and tying his handkerchief about
his brows, joined him in his labors. How
beautiful she looked in her father's old torn
straw. What a world of beauty, all
unconsciously
,
it shaded. With what grace she
handles
that rake, and how pliant and buoyant
the motions of her body as she turns over the
masses of fragrant hay. Hark! she is
singin
a jocund, careless voice
`Every lassie has her laddie
None, they say, have I,
Yet a' the lads they smile on me,
When coming thro' the rye.'
The sun at length set, seen in a celestial sea
of roseate light, for the shower had rolled
southward, where the columns of rain were at
a distance falling from the cloud to the earth,
and sweeping with vast and majestic motion
over the Sound. Biddy leaned on her rake and
gazed on the setting sun with pleasing
interest
,
for, to youth and intelligent beauty, like
hers, is ever united pure, though
uncultivated
,
taste.
`Come, my girl,' said her father, `let us
go homeward;' and taking his rakes and forks
upon his shoulder, he proceeded in the
direction
of his house, without looking back to see
if she followed.
She did not follow, nor did she hear him
call to her; for her attention had been a
moment
before drawn from the gorgeous
clouded
sunset, by the appearance of a boat upon
the creek, which formed a graceful bend at
the foot of the meadow, its dark limpid breast
half hidden by the trees that lined its banks.
She was standing beneath an old apple-tree
that grew within a few paces of a wall and
hedge that separated the meadow from the
creek. The boat contained two young
gentlemen
,
and from their costume and the
appearance
of the fishing tackle in the boat, with
a goodly number of fish, they had been on a
fishing excursion to the old bridge half a mile
above. They had discovered her some
minutes
before she saw them, and had purposely
checked their boat to gaze upon her as she
gracefully leaned on her rake with her father's
old straw thrown back from her brow and her
fine eyes full of thought, dwelling upon the
sunset sky.
Biddy lingered a moment to gaze with
surprise
and curiosity, as all pretty maidens
would do, on beholding the apparition of two
handsome young men at such a time and place.
The bold glances of one of them who wore an
incipient mustache and was very fashionably
and finically attired, recalled her to a sense of
her impropriety of her delay, and at the same
time to the fact of her father's old hat being
on her head. Half laughing, half blushing at
the appearance, she took off the hat,
loosening
in the act a cloud of glorious brown hair,
and turned to make her escape after her father
who had now got quite to the bars at the other
end of the meadow. Before she had taken
half a dozen steps she heard a footstep behind
her, and the sound told her one of the young
men had bounded over the wall. Alarmed,
she nevertheldss did not increase her pace,
and the next moment she felt a hand laid with
slight force upon her wrist. She turned with
some misgiving at her heart, though she felt
no fear, and beheld beside her the young man
with the mustache.
`Sweet creatshure,' he said in that
fashionable
chewed
tone, so much in vogue with
certain
people, `deue not fly me! Boye `Eaven!
what rustic loveliness.'
`Let me go, sir,' cried the young girl,
struggling
to disengage herself.
`Go! incomparable rurality! exquisite
rusticity
!
no, I will not let thee go.'
`But I
will
go sir,' said Biddy with
emphasis
.
`Nay, do not struggle, my pretty one, I
must have a kiss first.'
As he spoke he caught her in his arms and
would have ravished a kiss from her bright
indignant lips, if the other, who on seeing him
leap ashore and followed him, had not at the
instant came up.
`What do you mean, Barton?' he cried in
an indignant voice, at the same time
releasing
the maiden from his rude embrace.
`Poh, Morris,' he answered with a laugh,
`she's but a pretty tit-bit of a ruralI was
doing her an honor, boye `Eaven, to kiss her.'
`An honor I have no desire of receiving, I
assure you at
your
lips, sir,' said Biddy with a
smile of contempt, which she instantly
changed
to one of gratitude as she turned to the
other and warmly thanked him for his
interference
.
`I have done but my duty,' he answered,
fixing his fine eyes upon her with undisguised
yet respectfully subdued admiration. `I hope
you will parkon my friend here, who I trust
will not offend again.'
`Offend! demme! you are very green,
Morris
,'
said the other, as Biddy, after bowing
slightly to Edward Morris and bestowing
upon
him a radiant smile and a glance that made
his blood leap, tripped away with her old straw
hat in one hand and her rake balanced over
her shoulder; `she's but a farmer's daughter
and unprotected.' And the sensual yet
foppish
Fitz Henry Barton stuck his glass in his
eye and looked after her as she lightly crossed
the meadow. Nor could Morris refrain from
following her retreat with an admiring eye,
as he contemplated her pretty round figure
and graceful movements, into which she had
insensibly, from the innate consciousness of
being observed, thrown a spice of rustic
coquetry
.
Coquetry of manner is instinctive in
womaneven in the most natural and
unsophisticated
.
`True, she is unprotected,' said Morris, as
Biddy disappeared amid the trees of her
father's
orchard, `but helplessness is in itself a
sacred shield to protect innocence. I am
pained
,
Barton, at your licentious notions with
regard
to woman.'
`It is not woman in general that I think
lightly of,' said Barton arranging his cravat
with an affected air, `but of girls of her class
pretty girls I mean. Do you suppose I
would have gone up to a respectable young
lady in this way, eh?'
`I don't know what you mean by
respectable
,'
said Morris, with some severity.
`Why, respectable isdemme! is
respectable
,
eh?'
`Why, I will not affect to be ignorant of
what your notions of
respectable
are! They
are on a par with those who move in what is
called `fashionable life.' But `respectable'
is, in my idea, based on integrity, honesty,
and virtue. This farmer, whoever he is that
is the father of this young girl, is, if he
possesses
these qualities, as
respectable
as John
Jacob A'
`Pah, Morris!' said Barton, fingering his
mustache, `you're getting develish low of
late in your ideas! Do you mean to say that
I did as wrong in offering to kiss this pretty
wench as if she had beenhad beenhad
been for instance Miss  of Broadway?'
`Yes, higher wrongbecause in this
instance
the party was wholly unknown to you.'
`But, still, you don't say I insulted her?'
`I do.'
`She certainly can't
feel
so sensitively on
such a point, as a respectable girl would do!
Being brought up in the country she cannot
have that delicacy which is so easily wounded
in cultivated females.
`If anything their naturalness of character
and retired mode of life render them more so
than our city females. By heaven! Barton
I could have struck youshe was so very
modest and pretty.'
`Ha, ha! devilish good! Edward Morris,
the high descended and rich, doing battle for
a hay-making wench! 'Pon honor, Ned, I
must cut your acquaintance! ha, ha, hah!'
Morris looked slightly displeased, and they
crossed the hedge and entered their boat in
silence. They floated with the current some
distance, when Barton said, in a light
manner
`By-the-by, Morris, I think I shall follow
up this adventure! It is'nt every day a pretty
thing like this jumps into a man's arms!'
`I do believe, Barton,' said Morris, with
quickness, `that you feel yourself at liberty
to attempt the seduction of every unprotected
girl.'
`No, not if she is respectable! Oh! no! It
is the pretty poor girlsthefarmer's
daughters
the
millinersthe poor widow's
daughters
thethe'
`The poor, friendless and unprotected, in
fine,' continued Morris, with a look of
virtuous
indignation; `those whom Providence,
by denying them natural protectors, has
tacitly
and eloquently thrown upon the protection
of the strong and able. If you were not my
relative, Barton, I should despise you.'
`Parbleu, Ned! you are too philanthropic!
You have too high notions of the virtue of
this class of girls. There is'nt one of them
but would be glad to bestow their chary
favors
upon an elegant young fellow who has
money and can buy them playthings. If we
don't gather such rips peaches as that rosy
one we but now saw growing in yonder
meadow, some country poor will for us!'
`Tell me truly, Fitz Henry Barton,' cried
Morris, rising in the boat and looking him
full in the face; `do you really believe that
every young woman in humble life less
regards
her virtue, that priceless gem of all
female
honor, than those young ladies with
whom we daily associate in town on terms of
equality? Answer me, truly.
`Whoy,' answered Barton, coolly, trailing
his hand over the side of the boat in the water,
`I am surprised you can think otherwise.'
`I do think otherwise and I know
otherwise
!
Such girls feel an insult as deeply as
yes, as your own sister would, Barton!
They think as much of their personal honor,
too, as the females of our own condition! You
are in a great error when you assert the
opposite
to be the truth.'
`What fills our theatre galleries, and our
streets at night with courtezans, my dear boy?
They are mostly of this class,' said Barton,
scornfully.
`Not innate love of vice in thembut
treachery, false treachery in man! In nine
cases out of ten the poor creatures are victims
of broken vowsyouthful wives, degraded
through intemperate and worthless husbands,
or worse still, poor and unprotected maidens
tempted and tempted by the glitter of the gold
and the fascinations and art of libertines!
Nor are they all of this classmany of them
have fallen from the sphere in which the
highest
and best now move! It is, alas! too
common
an opinion you entertain, and one that
needs correcting.'
`Fudge, Ned! all this indignant sentiment
because I offered to kiss a pretty country lass,'
said Barton, affecting to wear an air of
indifference
which he was far from feeling
beneath
his friend's severe language; `for all
this I shall follow up my rustic
amour
.'
`If you do, Barton, and wrong come of it to
the young creature, I shall shake you off
from my heart and hand as I would a
serpent
.'
`Oh, you are too warm, Morris! Well, I
will let her drop! But she is too fair to lose.
Did you see what an inviting waist! what
tournure
and ease! Heigho? well, let her go;
Here we are at the foot of your father's
garden
.
Let us land.'
The two young men possessing such
opposite
characters, landed at the stairs of a
summer-house that projected over the water,
and taking their lines and fish, proceeded in
silence, by a winding gravelled avenue,
towards
the country house before mentioned as
visible from David Woodhull's.
Fitz Henry Barton was descended from an
old Dutch family on his mother's side, and
therefore belonged to the true aristocracy of
New York; for, in the eyes of this class,
Hendrick
Hudson and William, the Conqueror,
had the same relative rank. He was an
exquisite
in mind and manners. Nature had
given him common sense, but art had
perverted
it. He was a gentleman by education and
position and circumstances, in every thing
except principles. In this he was sadly
wanting
.
He was sensual, and therefore when he
found it was a fashionable vice, very easily
became a
roue
. His libertinism, however,
had its limits. He was one of that species of
hawk that will pounce only where its game
flies low and is crippled. He never saw a
pretty girl of what Mrs. Trollope aptly called
`the second quality class,' without licentious
emotions and regarding her as `fair game;'
while in the presence of the young and
lovely
of his own condition, he never harbored
thoughts unworthy them or his own relative
social positionwhich is to say, that Fitz
Henry Barton was a gentleman among his
own condition, and a low, unprincipled
debauche
out of this sphere.
Edward Morris, on the other hand, was a
high-minded honorable man. He loved honor
for itself and virtue for its own reward. He
was a physician by profession, though his
inherited
wealth precluded the necessity of his
pursuing it. He loved reading and the arts,
and mingled freely in society, which he
adorned
and in which he was beloved. His elder
and only sister had married the elder brother
of Barton, and hence the intimacy of the two
thus relatedan intimacy of circumstances
rather than of sympathy of minds. They
were now in the country at the seat of
Morris'
father, it being the first time for five years
he had passed any time there, college and
European
travel having kept him that period
from his native city. He now made his
father's house, both in town and country, his
home. Barton lived in town in his own
private
rooms, which he had fitted up and
furnished
in the most sumptuous manner.
Such was the character and condition of
these two sportsmen whom Biddy so
unexpectedly
encountered. As she tripped
lightly
homeward, she could not help thinking to
himself how rude and unpleasant one of them
was and how handsome and generous the
other. Fitz Henry, exquisite as he was,
plainly suffered much by the comparison
which she was busily instituting in her little
head. At length the scales preponderated so
decidedly in favor of her preserver, that she
gave her thoughts from that moment wholly
to him, quite forgetting the other.
`How indignant he was!' thought she,
`how his black eyes lighted up! How
handsome
his face is, and how gentle his voice
was when he spoke to me. I am sure I shall
never forget him in this world!'
She said this as she reached the gate to the
house, from which she now heard her name
pronounced in every key in anger's gamut.
She hastened forward, but caring less for her
cross mother and sisters than she ever did
before. She had something now in her heart
pleasant to dwell upon. So she went in and
received the usual three-fold scolding for her
delay, after her father had got in, with great
patience and went cheerfully about the tasks
imposed upon her singing
`I'm o'er young to marry yet,
I'm o'er young to marry.'
The next day she was sent into the field by
Euphrosia, who spitefully determined that she
should be exposed to the sun, `Till,' as she
said to Sally, `the pert minx who thinks
herself
so much better looking than other folks,
is tanned black.'
It was about noon of the next day that she
was raking her swathe of hay, shaded beneath
her good-natured father's old straw hat, and
when she had got in her rake a heavy mass
which she had made three several efforts to
throw upon the hay-cock, that a hand was laid
upon the rake, and a kind voice said to her
`I fear this is too heavy for you to lift, miss
allow me to assist you.'
The voice thrilled her heart with strange
emotionsbut they were those of undefined
and subdued joy. It was the voice that she
had heard in her dreams all the last night?
She looked timidly up and saw also the face
that had mingled in those dreams. She
smiled
,
and tremblingly resigned the rake.
Morris
looked his thanks and soon completed her
task.
`This is very warm work in the noon-day
sun, for a young girl,' he said drying the
perspiration
on his forehead with his cambric
kerchief.
`No, sir, not quite so warm as in the house,'
she said, archly; but, he being ignorant of
how her domestic affairs stood in the family,
this was lost upon him at the time, though
remembered afterwards.
David Woodhull lay beneath an apple-tree
sleeping away the noon, in its cool shade.
Morris cast a glance towards him, and then
taking Biddy's hand playfully, yet
respectfully
,
led her to the same tree and sat
beside
her upon a grass grown root. Why
submitted
she to be led so passively? The
power
was not in the slight touch of his hand, but
in his eye, his smile, the sweet inviting
expression
of his whole face. Love had her in
leading-strings, all invisibly to her.
An hour elasped, and David Woodhull
awoke, and so did Edward and Biddy from
their happy waking dream! An hour had
passed and Biddy was taught that she had a
heart, and Morris also, found that he had lost
his! An hour had passed! and in one hour a
young couple can say a great deal and make
wonderful progress towards friendship. It is
useless to say all Morris said or all Biddy
replied
,
with downcast eyes and tell-tale cheek.
Suffice it that Edward Morris had been struck
with the pretty hay-maker at first sight, and
not having ceased thinking or dreaming of her,
had resolved to pay a visit to the meadow to
see her once more
just
to get acquainted
with her, and if she were worthy, devise some
means to protect her from Barton's annoying
libertinism. One hour in her society proved
to him her worthiness; and when David
awoke he had an impassioned declaration of
his passion trembling on his lips. He hastily
instead, pressed them to her hand and
hastened
away before her father was aware of his
presence.
`How fortunate that I did not commit
myself
,
he said on cool reflection, as he
regained
the boat; `if I had done so I could never
have unbound my honor from my passed
word! What would my friends have said?
Well, 'tis passed now! She is very lovelyso
ingenuous, so unsophisticated! So sweet in
manner yet withal charmingly
brusque
. I
am certainly in love with her and I am glad
it has gone no fartherthat I have not
interested
her in me so that she will not speedily
forget me! Yes, I will see her no more!
Honor
,
principle, duty forbid it, for I can never
marry her. Oh, this confounded opinion of
caste
, that will not let a man marry where his
heart would! If, now, she were in my
condition
of life, I should not hesitate to cast
myself
at her feet and declare my passion and
offer her my heart. Because she is a poor
farmer's daughter I can, (if I am only a
fashionable
man,) but honorably seduce her, if I
pursue her acquaintance. Out upon the
hollow
falsities of life! I must cease to think of
her! Honor forbids all else! Yet I will watch
over her lest this libertine, Barton, should
meditate her ruin. The maiden, however
low she be, who has interested the feelings of
Edward Morris, shall be entitled to his
honorable
protection! If then she should be
so
honored, why not carry it further and honor
her as my wife with an undisputed right to
protect her? Nay, I can think of the subject
no longer.'
In half an hour afterwards during every
moment of which he was thinking of this
subject
,
he arrived at his landing-place at the
foot of the lawn at his father's seat.
Whether
Edward Morris would have sought to see
Biddy again or not, cannot be said, as he was
the next morning unexpectedly called to
accompany
an aunt to Charleston, where he
was absent, even at the time our story opens.
In a subsequent part, we shall carry out
more fully the fortunes of our characters,
than the limits of a single chapter of this
`work' will enable us to do, and show
the effect of Morris' hay-making visit upon
Biddy's heart and life. The remembrance of
it was, as we have said, the only solace that
enabled her to endure the tyranny of her
mother and sisters, without a murmur.
PART II.
`Love laughs at locksmiths.'
The
memory of the hour's tete-a-tete with
the handsome young angler beneath the
shadow
of the old apple-tree, was all that
sweetened
,
after his departure for Charleston, the
bitter cup of Biddy's domestic servitude.
At length, her amiable sister, Euphrosia,
heard of this interview, through a rustic
called
Mike Moore; who witnessed it and told it
in petty jealousy. It was during a visit to a
neighbor's that the intelligence was whispered
into her ear. That Biddy should have a bean
first, and a
city
bean, that was not to be en
dured by a young lady of her temperament.
She made no delay in hastening home to vent
her rage upon the lovely victim of household
ill-humor. Biddy was sitting in the door
pearing apples for a dumpling, and was
singing
,
as her sister approached
`Some love to roam,
Away, from home'
`Yes, you little jade,' cried Miss Euphrosia,
untying the strings of her bonnet and
removing
it from her head with a flushed
countenance
;
`yes, some love to roam, miss! in
hay-fields, under apple trees, miss! with
strangers, miss! I'll put a stop to this kind of
pretty business very quick miss!'
`What's the matter, Throsia?' cried the
mother, coming out of the dairy with a roll of
butter in her hand which she was working;
`what's the jade done now?' and she cast an
angry and suspicious maternal glance towards
the silent, conscious Biddy.
`Done, mother! she has been flirting and
fooling with a young city gentleman she's got
acquainted with some how. Yes, when she
should have been making hay she was
making
love! I wish,' she added, spitefully, on
reflecting how much she had herself missed,
`I wish I had never let her go to the meadow!
But who'd have thought it?'
By degrees Biddy's mother got the whole
tale from the mortified and indignant Miss
Euphrosia; when she turned full upon the
culprit, who with her blushing face half had
in the dark curls that fell around it, bent her
head over the pan of apples to hide her
confusion
.
She was rather angry than
intimidated
,
and while she feared her mother's wrath
she could not but secretly smile at her sister's
vexation and her own triumph.
`So, Jade!' cried the mother stepping up
to her and stooping so as to bring her face
upon a level with her's; `so, you have been
encouraging beaux! Pretty hay-making this;
I'll teach you how to make hay! I'll give you
beaux to be sure! What right have you to
speak to a man? What right have you to let
a man speak to you? A whole hour under the
apple tree and that old fool, my husband,
snoring
away all the time, I'll wager! Oh, you
little deception piece! Oh, you trollop! Who
was the man?'
`I don't know mother,' said Biddy.
`Don't know! You shall tell! You'll get
to be no better than you should be, yet! But
I'll take care o'that! I'll make you tell who
the villian is you keep company with! Won't
tell!
We'll see!
Put down that apple-pan
put it down I say and come with me to the
attic!'
Biddy obeyed and silently followed the
cross old woman to a little dark room opening
upon the roof of the old farm house.
`Now, miss!' said her mother, taking
breath, `here you shall stay shut up just one
week on bread and water! I'll cure your love
and flirts! One week shall you stay, and then
a week more if you don't let me know who it
was Mike Moore saw you billing and cooing
with under the apple-tree! Will you tell,
jade?'
`I don't know, mother,' said Biddy vexed
and weeping.
`Don't know, mother,' mocked Miss
Euphrosia
,
from the bottom of the stairs; `lock
her up, mamma, and let's see if it's `don't
know mother at the end of the week! There
is nothing like lock and key and bread and
water for love and obstinacy.
Finding she could get no confession from
Biddy, her mother locked her in, though not
without leaving her a large quantity of wool
for her to card before night, saying she should
have enough work to do, `if she was locked
up.'
Left alone, the youthful prisoner sat for a
long time upon the edge of the low bedstead
that nearly filled the room, and the tears
trickled
silently down her bright cheek. But
Biddy's
spirit was not such as readily bows to
grief. It was keenly alive to injustice and could
not endure insult or wrong. She reflected
upon
her situation, and felt that she was the
victim
of a species of domestic tyranny that
might last until life itself ended. She felt
she had done nothing to deserve all she daily
suffered at the hands of her mother and sisters;
and that in the present instance she was
blameless
.
She knew not the name of her admirer.
She had, therefore, told no falsehood. She
felt she was unjustly and wrongfully punished.
`Am I to endure this for life?' she said, her
darkeyes flashing and her cheek burning;
`no, I will be a slave no longer! I will quit
this hateful house this very night! I will go
to the city and seek employment. Other
young girls have gone there and are doing
well! Why may not I? I have to work and
slave here at home, a common drudgeI can
be placed in no worse condition in the city;
and I may, at least, find people that will be
kind to me! Oh, dear! this way I live at home
will break my spirit! I tremble now at my
mother's or sisters' step, or the sound of their
voices. I will tremble no longer! I will
run-away
and take care of myself. The day may
come when they will be glad to have the
privelege
of speaking to me, much as they despise
me now! The West-Cheater stage passes the
gate at five o'clock to-morrow morning. If I
can possibly escape from this room I will be at
the gate before any one is up and take it! I
have five shillings of my own, and the fare is
only half a dollar.'
Having formed this resolution in her mind
Biddy looked round her little chamber and
collected all the scanty apparel that she could
call her own into a bundle which she hid
heneath
the bed. She arranged more neatly a
pretty artificial in her Sunday hat, smoothed
out the ribbons and prepared all her travelling
costume, as it should be. Soon as she had
got all things ready for her elopement, she
sat down and began diligently to card the
wool her mother had left for her day's task,
the mean while thinking of her apple-tree
lover, and singing:
`They told me not to love him,
They said that he would prove
Unworthy of so rich a gem
As woman's priceless love.
`What is that caterwauling up there in the
loft, you miss,' cried the gentle Euphrosia;
`mother did'nt look you up there to sing, I
guess!'
Biddy ceased her song and continued her
carding, while her thoughts busily ran upon
the mode in which she could best effect her
escape. All at once she laid down her cards
and stepped softly to the door. The lock was
a large stout one, and the bolt went deep and
firmly into its bed. A few moments
examination
convinced her she could not move it.
Shaking her little plodding head she
approached
the window and softly opened it. It was
what is called a dormant window. For
several
feet the steep roof descended from it to
the caves, from which it was twelve feet to
the ground. She surveyed this mode of
egress
with much misgiving; to slide safely
down the roof and then descend to the ground,
was a feat she hardly dare attempt. Yet she
could see no other mode of escape, and
resolved
to attempt it towards morning, if she
could find any thing by which to let herself
down from the room. After a long search for
a cord or a hank of yarn, and not being able
to find any, she was forced to give up all
thoughts of this mode of egress. Again she
approached the door and carefully examined
the lock. It promised to resist all efforts to
move it. She was ready to give up all hopes
of escape unless by the dangerous passage of
the roof, the height of which intimidated her
As her eyes wandered over the door she saw
that a screw was loose in one of the changes.
Instantly the idea occurred to her that if it
were possible to remove the hinges she might
escape at midnight through the door, and so
by stealing down stairs, softly pass out of the
house by the back door, which, as is
customary
in farmer's houses, was always left on the
latch.
With an eager touch she trembling took
hold of the loosened screw. It yielded, and
a few revolutions placed it in her hand. There
were two more in the same hinge and three in
the hinge below, all five of which, on
examination
,
seemed to be too firmly driven to be
removed without a screw-driver. After a
moment's reflection, Biddy recollected there
was an old case-knife among some nails and
rubbish in a trunk beneath the bed. She
soon had it in her hand, and to her delight,
on trial, found that it fitted the head of the
screws. To make sure, she applied herself to
start one of them. After a little exertion it
yielded. Great was her joy at this promise of
success. The second also gave way to her
broken knife, and in a few minutes she had
loosened all five of them a single turn in their
bed.
`Now,' said she, with triumph, `all I have
to do is to take off the hinges when every
body is asleep and walk quietly out of the
house. I feel already free. What will sister,
Euphrosia, say! Oh, what will mother do!
Sally 'll be glad, because I shall be out of the
way of offering temptation to her awkward
swert heart, John Burn!'
`What are you at here, miss?' suddenly
cried her mother, bolting into the room. `I've
been listening and hant heard a bit of carding
for ten minutes! What are you doin,' jade,
with that old knife?'
`Nothing, mother,' said Biddy, throwing it
behind the bed.
`Nothing, I'll promise you. Oh, you are
a good-for-nothing?' Here the old woman
looked at her carding. `Not two bats of wool
carded, as I'm a living woman. What have
you been doing all this while? Tell me, or
I'll wallop you if you was fifty years old!'
`I've been carding.'
`Carding!' repeated her mother,
scornfully
;
`I could do in five minutes what you
have been two whole hours at. Well, you
don't go to bed this night, nor I neither, `till
you get that wool all carded and batted, so
you know what's best for yourself!'
Here the maternal jailor was leaving the
little prison in which she had confined our
heroine, but turned back to say
`Don't let me hear any more singing, miss,
if you do, I'll tie a handkerchief over your
mouth, and see how you'll like that' Come
now, work! I shall be in after night's
milking
to see if you have done your task.'
With this parting admonition she left her
to her solitude and carding.
`Oh, how glad I am she did not get the
knife,' said Biddy, as her mother closed the
door at the stair-foot; `now I have that I don't
care how much she scolds. Oh, I wish the
night would come. Well, if I don't card this
wool, I see it will interfere with my plan of
escape, for mother 'll set up all night to make
me do it. I'll work hard and have it done
when she comes in and then she'll let me
alone 'till morning. Dear, delightful
morning
,
that is to give me freedom. It will then
find the bird flown from its cage.'
Biddy now set herself industriously to ply
her task. She was naturally studious, and
labor was rather a pleasure than a toil to her.
As the sun set she completed her `stint,' and
soon afterwards she received the anticipated
visit of her amiable mother. Mrs. Woodhull
looked sharply at her `bats' and then cast her
eyes round the room and looked under the
bed to see if none of the wool had been
concealed
to lessen the task.
`Well, girl, you have got through, I see.
It's well for you you have. To-morrow I'll
give you so nothing else you'll not get through
quite so easy. Here, Phrosia, bring your
sister
up her supper.
Biddy heard a light malicious laugh from
below and the gentle Euphrosia appeared with
a tin dipper filled with water, in one hand, and a
plate of the crust of bread held in the other.
She could hardly conceal her exultation
beneath
a look of assumed compassion.
Placing
them on a chair she gave the prisoner a
glance of malicious pleasure, made her a
contemptuous
curtsy, and left the room. Biddy
would have cried with vexation if she had
not determined on flight from her tormentors;
as it was, she smiled quietly like one concious
of having the victory.
`There is your supper, trollop!' said her
mother, in her usual cross tone; `bread and
water, just as I promised you! It's all you'll
get 'till your week's out. Now, you go to
bed and don't let me hear any more singing.'
`No, ma'm,' said Biddy, calmly and quietly.
`You are quite cured, I see, with your
being
shut up. Oh, yes, I'll bring down your
high look and proud spirit. Lovers. City
beaux! I guess you'll care 'bont 'em after a
week's living on bread and water. Now to
bed, for I'll have you got out of it bright and
early.'
With this the old woman left her and went
down stairs, from whence Biddy heard the
hateful laughter of the tender Miss
Euphrosia
as she asked her mother how she relished
the bread and water.
`Yes, they may laugh to-night and I will
laugh to-morrow,' said Biddy. `This hateful
bread. They have given me what no body
can eat. If I should stay here they would
positively starve me. No one can blame me
for running away from such a homefor
leaving
such an unnatural mother and sister.'
Biddy drank a little water but left the stale
crust untouched; then placing her bundle on
a chair, and her neat Sunday bonnet upon it,
and laying her old case-knife beneath her
little
pillow, she threw herself upon her bed
without undressing, and was soon buried in
profound sleep. Accustomed to wake at dawn
to build all the fires, she did not fear
over-sleeping
herself; on the contrary, while
asleep, she retained the consciousness of the
purpose she had in view, and this
consciousness
caused her to wake just after midnight.
She instantly, but lightly, started to her feet,
and looked out of the window to learn from
the stars, which shone brightly, the hour.
Though she could discover in the east no
traces of morning, she resolved at once to
effect
her escape from the house and wait by
the road-side for the stage.
Listening some time, and finding the whole
house still, she put on a neat calico dress, her
cottage hat, and best shoes, and sticking her
old green parasol through the knot of her
bundle, she took the broken knife from
beneath
the pillow, and approached the door.
After pausing to be sure that all was quiet
below, she felt for the hinges, (for the room
was lighted only by the stars,) and after a few
awkward attempts, she succeeded in drawing
the first screw. In a few seconds the other
followed, and the upper hinge was liberated
from the door. Inspired by her success, to
active exertion, the fair girl stooped to draw
the three from the lower hinge, careful, the
while, to keep the door in its place, lest it
should fall upon her head, or, worse still,
upon the floor, and so betray her by the noise.
She had drawn one out, and was turning the
second, when the knife slipped from her grasp,
and fell at her feet with a sharp startling
sound. Involuntarily she held her breath,
while her heart ceased to beat! Full two
minutes she remained immoveable, listening
to learn if the noise had disturbed any one;
but all was silent. Every one slept save
herself
.
Again she renewed her work with more
caution, and the last screw slowly yielded to
her knife. The next moment, with a
bounding
pulse, she drew it forth from its loosened
bed with her fingers.
The most difficult part was now to be
achieved. The door was made of heavy oak
plank, and she feared that in displacing it, she
might, from want of strength and light, let
it fall to the ground. She was, however, not
a girl to be checked by possible obstacles.
Standing up, she felt for the bolt which alone
held the door, and as she did so, scarcely
could she refrain from smiling at the
emphasis
with which she recollected her mother
had last turned it to secure her, as if she had
said, `Good bolt, I can safely trust
you!
'
Fertile in expedients, Biddy, on finding the
bolt would easily slide out from the side in
which it was so strongly imbedded, to
prevent
the door falling upon her when she
should move it, drew, without noise, her
bedstead
along, 'till a corner of it pressed against
the door, and served as a supporter. Having
made this cautious preparation, she took hold
of the door by the side on which the hinges
had hung, and exerting all her strength, drew
it bodily towards her. As the bolt left its
socket, the whole weight of the door was
supported an instant upon her arm, which
soon gave out, when it fell heavily over upon
the bed which her sagacity had placed to
receive
it. A dead sound, not very loud, was
all the effect it produced. She paused, and
listened to see if the noise had awakened any
one, when, finding all was still as before, she
began to indulge the joyful emotions that
filled her bosom at the prospect of securely
effecting her escape.
Taking up her bundle, and feeling in her
bosom to ascertain if her little purse of five
shillings was safe, she knelt down by her bed
side, and softly and piously repeated the
`Lord's prayer,' a beautiful series of petitions
that, poor girl, she much needed to put up at
such a time. Then with a light heart and a
lighter step she crossed the prostrate door of
her little prison. Accustomed to traverse the
whole house in the dark, she found no
difficulty
in reaching the narrow angular stairway
that led to the large family room below.
Softly
as a kitten and with as stealthy a step, she
descended the stairs and opened the door at
its foot and entered the room below. All was
still, save the monotonous ticking of the old
clock standing in the farthest corner, and the
occasional sharp chirp of a cricket on the
hearth, where a faint gleam showed the
half-buried
fire. She listened to detect any sound
from her mother's room, which was on one
side of the family room, or from her sister's
which was on the other. She could only hear
her father snoring. Gaining confidence she
stole across the wide room and laid her hand,
dark as it was, readily upon the wooden latch.
She hesitated ere she raised it, for a feeling
of loneliness and desolation came suddenly
over her. She was leaving the house of her
infancythe roof of her child-hood, perhaps
for ever! her father, too, whom she loved,
possibly never to see him more. She felt
desolate
,
and her heart swelled with grief at the
cruel fate that should drive her thus young
and unprotected from the home which should
have been the natural asylum of her youth
and innocence. And whither was she to go?
For
what
was she to exchange her present
unhappy
lot? Was she going to a happier one?
Such were the thoughts that passed through
her mind as she stood with the latch half lifted
in her fingers; but this natural emotion was
temporary. The next moment she raised the
latch and crossed the well-worn door stone
into the night air! She immediately
experienced
a sensation of freedom and
elasticity
of spirits. Her pulse boundedher
feet scarce touched feet the ground as she
flew over it in the direction of the high-road,
which was half a mile distant. The meadow
where she had first seen Edward Morris, lay
in her course. As she came to the stile that
led from the domestic yard or lawn into this
field, she heard a noise behind her. She
bounded in alarm over the fence, and at the
same instant, her favorite old house-dog,
Bruin, was at her side with a fierce bark!
`Down, Bruin,' she said, in a low,
authoritative
tone as the dog caught her bundle in
his glittering teeth The noble dog
recognized
her voice and crouched at her feet. `Go
home, Bruin,' she cried, stamping her little
foot on the ground. The dog crouched lower
and licked the shoe that enforced her
command
.
`No, you shall not go with me! Poor
Bruin, I shall not see you for a long time,!
fear! Who will now pet you and feed you!
I know you will miss poor Biddy, for one I
Go back!'
The affectionate animal still kept his
almost
supplicating posture at her feet. In vain
she scolded, in vain she caressed him! If
she ran forward a few yards, he would bound
joyfully by her side; and, when she stopped to
reprove him, he would crouch silently at her
feet.
`Well, then, if you
will
come, I cant' help
it,' she said, in a tone that conveyed to his
understanding all which the words could have
done to a human being. With a quick, short
bark of delight, he now bounded on before
her, and his very happiness rewarded her for
her condescension. Bruin was a large, noble
barn-dog, affectionate and faithful. Biddy had
petted him from a pup, and a mutual
affection
had grown up between them! She now
felt happy that he was with her, for his
presence
cheered the loneliness of her way. It
was her determination, however, to make him
return when she got into the stage at the gate;
and so, together, they went across the
meadow
,
'till Biddy reached the old apple-tree.
Here she paused, and seated herself just
where Edward had sat beside her that sultry
noon, and indulged her heart in thinking over
the whole sweet interview, and all that he had
said to her, and in recalling his gentle smile
and the rich tones of his low-keyed voice!
She sat there full two hours, so lost in silent
reminiscences, with Bruin lying watchful at
her feet, she was wholly unconscious of the
flight of minutes. The distant rattle of wheels
along the turnpike first roused her from her
dreams of the past. On looking round she
saw that morning was already tinting the east,
and that the sun would soon be up. Blushing
herself like the roseate morn, she took up her
little bundle, and, followed by Bruin, hurried
across the meadow to the hedge which the
two young fishers had bounded over, one to
insult, the other (how dear in memory that
other!) to rescue and defend her! After she
crossed the hedge she hastened along a
narrow
foot-path, by the side of the creek,
towards
a wide bridge which she had to cross
before getting to the turnpike. She at length
reached the road just as the stage came in
sight.
`Now, Bruin, you will have to go back,' she
said patting him and half embracing his
shaggy neck, as if taking farewell of her
favorite
.
He rubbed his nose in her hand and
pressed against her affectionately.
`Yes, but you must go, as I can't pay your
fare,' she said, in half playfulness half in
in earnest, as the driver on discovering
her with the bundle by the road-side, drew
up his horses. There were but three
passengers
in the stage, a farmer, an old woman,
and a young man, all of whom were asleep.
`Whoa, oah! wo! Want a passage, miss?'
asked the coachman, throwing his lines over
the back of his box and preparing to descend
from it to open the door.
`Yes, sir,' said Biddy.
`To the city?' he asked, as he closed the
door after she had got inside with her bundle.
`Yes, sir.'
`I'll take your fare, missfifty cents.'
Biddy searched for her little purse and
drew from it four
short
shillings and gave
them to him. The goodnatured driver looked
at them in a hesitating way a few seconds,
as they lay in his palm, and then shaking his
head and smiling as he gazed upon her pretty
face, said
`Rather short, miss, but as your little purse
seems to be full as short, and you are a pretty
girl, I'll let you ride for this;' and Dick
Sherwood pocketed the four ten-cent pieces,
mounted his box, and dashed along towards
the city.
It was the first time Biddy had been in a
stage-coach, and the novelty of her situation
for awhile drew her attention from her
present
object. Every thing pleased and
interested
her.
At length, as the sun rose, they entered the
little village of Fordham, and her fellow
passengers
awaked, at the stopping of the stage
at the inn, to change horses. Once more
started, they dashed on towards Harlem, and
traversing this town entered upon the Third
Avenue, which, for five miles, approaches the
city in a straight line, a noole and magni cent
thoroughfare! Swiftly the stage rolled over
the Macadamized Avenue, and Biddy looking
from the window, soon beheld the towers and
spires of the metropolis, while on her left was
the Sound, lively with vessels and steamers,
and its shores adorned by the beautiful
country
seats of opulent merchants. As she
approached
the junctlon of the Avenue with
the Bowery, she delightedly recognized the
surrounding houses and churches, for she had
twice been to the city, in the family wagon,
once with her father, two years before, and
once with her mother and sister, with
marketing
.
She therefore had some idea of the
place which she was entering, and whither
she had come to seek her fortune. As the
stage rattled over the pavements of the
Bowery
,
she turned her eyes from the
bewildering
seenes that attracted her gaze, on either
crowded side-walk, to decide her thoughts on
some mode of conduct, that she might
pursue
on being landed at the stage-office. She
could think, after much reflection, of no
better
course to adopt, than to seek one of the
intelligence offices, of which, in common with
all other country lasses living in the
neighborhood
of the city, she had heard much; and
like them, thought she had only to go there to
get employment at once. What this
employment
should be, she had not decided! Vague
ideas of milliners and mantua-makers,
sempstresses
and tailoresses, housemaids and
childrens'
nurses, flitted through her little head;
and the stage drew suddenly up at the office
before she had determined what she should
be. She sat still, undecided and irresolute,
until the other passengers alighted. As the
coachman offered his hand for her bundle,
she said for the first time feeling the
embarrassment
of her situation
`Will you be kind enough to direct me to
an intelligence office?'
`Certainly, miss,' said Dick Sherwood,
bluffly; `so you've come up to service, then?
Too pretty a face to be trusted here unless you
have some body to look after you! Here,
you darkee,' he cried to a negro lad lounging
in the sun on a bench near by, `you know
every crook and corner in Yorkshow this
young woman a respec'ble 'telligence office:
When you come back, come to me and I'll
give you a silver sixpence.'
`Done Boss,' said the African grinning;
`I knows firs' rate 'telligem office, up in de
wecinity ob de Battery and City Hall.'
`See then you take her to it, and make no
mistake.'
`Boss nebber know nigger make mistake
when de silver in de bargain. Come, missus,
I'll show you de way. Leff nigger car' him
bundle.'
The coachman kindly assisted her from the
stage, and struck with her innocence and
beauty, he cordially shook her by the hand,
as she left him saying
`If as how, miss, you don't get along so
well as you expect to here in York, and want
a friend, you'll always find one here, at No.
21, that is, provided you behaves yourself
vartuous
;
'cause I am a family man, with a wife
and seven children of my own. Good bye,
and bless your sweet face! it'll be your best
friend or worst enemy, in this wicked world!
Now start, you nigger and be civil to the
young woman, or I'll' and Dick finished the
sentence by making a significant gesture with
his doubled fist.
`I thank you, sir, for your kindness,' said
Biddy, `I hope I shall one day be able to
repay
it.'
`Confound it now,' said Dick Sherwood, to
himself, angrily, `that's al'ays the way! I
can never do a little sarvice but I must be paid
for with a `thankee.' I never gets any body
in my debt for a good turn. I likes, miss, to
do a good sarvice, but I don't like to be
thanked
for it. It is too much like
quod
for
quid
,
as the lawyers say. Now go and follow that
nigger, and may you get a sitivation to suit
you, for I knows you deserve a nice one.'
Biddy again thanked the kind coachman,
with a grateful glanee of her bright eyes so
long as he forbade her to do so with her
tongue, and, happy at finding even so blunt
a friend in the great lonesome city into which
she had thrown herself, tripped lightly after
the negro; yet her heart was lonely and
heavy. Every face was strange! She had
gone but a few paces, when she felt
something
coldly touch her hand, for Biddy wore
no gloves. Shrinking and looking down, she
gave a scream of delight and surprise. It
was good old Bruin! He had followed the
stage all the way to town, keeping a cautious
distance behind it, and now approached her
and thrust his nose into her hand. It was
like meeting a dear old friend! She forgave
him for the happiness it gave her to see him
once more. He evinced his joy in his own
rough way, in finding he was no longer an
unwelcome companion, and sticking close to
her side, accompanied her through the long
and thronged thoroughfare, a faithful friend
and attendant. She patted him on the head
and felt that much of her loneliness and
desolation
had vanished with his presence.
`Yes, good Bruin, you shall stay with me
if you wish toit shall not be my will that
parts us,' she said to him, as he trotted along
looking up in her face and occasionly casting
a suspicious glance at the negro, between
whom and his mistress there existed some
kind of mysterious relationship, which he
could not understand. All at once as they
entered a narrow street, he bounded from her
side and smelled at the bundle carried by the
black. The next instant he tore it from his
grasp with his teeth, and brought it and
laid it at Biddy's feet.
`What are you doing, Bruin? He is
carrying
my bundle for me. Don't be so rude!'
Biddy restored the bundle to the alarmed
negro, with a reproving glance at the dog,
who shrunk along beside her with an
ashamed
look, 'till by a kind word she restored him
to her confidence.
`Dat big dog, mighty sharp, missus,' said
the negro who at every step glared his round
white eyes over either shoulder to see if he
was likely to be assailed again in the
discharge
of his function as porter.
`He'll not hurt you,' said Biddy, smiling
at his fears.
`He hab mighty sharp teeth, missus! Yah,
yah, I tink he sensible dogyah, yah, yah!
guess he tink nigger steal um bundle.'
`Is the intelligence office a good ways from
here?' she asked, anxious to reach it.
`Jiss roun' de firs' corner ob de secon'
street, seben doors from de nex onegi! I
knows de place like de primmer!'
Leaving Biddy on her way to the
intelligence
office, let us return to the farm-house
she had left. Just as Biddy was startled from
her pleasing reminiscences of the hour in
which Edward Morris had won her guileless
heart, by the rattling of the stage coach, Mrs
Woodhull was awaked from her sleep by a
more than usually sonorous snore from her
lord, or rather vassal, David Woodhull. It
was just the peep of day, the hour busy
house-wives
love to rise and set to work! Her first
thought was of her prisoner in the attic.
Hurrying
on her clothes she hastened forth from
her sleeping-room and opened the stair door.
She listened all was still.
`The jade! She sleeps sound enough for
all her bread and water! BiddyBiddy
Woodhull,' she screamed, up the stairs. But
Biddy was being whirled along the turnpike
in a stage-coach, and could not hear her.
`Why don't you wake up, you lazy thing,
you?' added the mother in a londer and
angrier
tone. `If I come up there, I'll wake you
up, with a vengeance!' Again Mrs
Woodhull
listened, and all was still. Quicker than
old women usually move, but not cross old
women, she hastened to the water pail and
filled a great pitcher with water. Softly she
crept up stairs into the dark attic and felt her
way to the door. She felt along, and felt
along, still all was vacancy!
`Where can the door be?' she almost spoke
aloud. She took another step forward, struck
her shin against it and pitched headlong upon
it. The pitcher was smashed, the water
deluged
her to the skin, and her nose was
broken
in the fall' The noise of this mishap,
added
to her screams of fright and fury, awoke
Miss Euphrosia from a dream of a spruce
Chatham street beau who was in the act of
falling at her feet when her mother fell over
the door; awoke Miss Sally from visions of
connubial bliss with John Burn, and rcused
David Woodhull to his feet as if the house
had been on fire.
`Oh, what is the matter?' shrieked Miss
Euphrosia and Sally, flying from their room
in their night dresses.
`I am killed and murdered! Mercy, help!'
shrieked their mother, while the water from
above leaking through the floor, fell
trickling
upon their faces.
`Yes, yes! she's murdered! I feel the
blood!' shrieked the delicate Euphrosia, and
she tried to faint but could not for want of
sufficient blood of her own.
`I'll soon know what's the matter, gals,'
said David, striking a light; and hastening
up stairs in his drawers, followed by his
daughters, they soon saw how the whole
affair
stood! Mrs Woodhull had got to her
feet and was wiping the blood from her nose,
while her dress dripped with water. As soon
as the light appeared she recovered her
self-possession
and looked around. The door, for
which she had been feeling, instead of being
its proper place, lay upon the bed, and she
had stumbled over it as she now saw! A
glance told her that its hinges had been on
the inside, The whole truth flashed
instantly
upon her ready mind.
`Where's Biddy?' she cried, looking under
the bed and in every part of the room. `She's
escaped!'
`Where, how?' cried the sisters,
bewildered
with surprise. `Not by the window!'
`Window! Fools! What need of
jumping
from windows with a door off its hinges,
and laid on its back to walk over, yes, and
to break one's neck over? She's got off in
the night by going down stairs! Here's the
knife I saw her have in her hand. This was
her screw-driver!'
`And she's taken her clothes and best
Sunday
hat with her!' cried Miss Euphrosia, in
unalloyed astonishment.
`And her parasol, too!' exclaimed Sally,
who found no trace of it after looking about
the room.
`She shall pay for this,' said Mrs
Woodhull
,
compressing her thin lips with spiteful
rage. `She's gone to some o' the neighbors
with a doleful story of being locked up. I'll
lock her up and tie her too, if I catch her
again.
`Perhaps she's gone to the police-office, to
complain,' said David, whose indiguation
sometimes got the better of his fears of his
wife, and who now felt angry that Biddy
should have been locked up, of which he had
not known before; `I've hearn of parents
being put in `the Tombs,' there, for ill usage
to their children.'
This was a great and bold speech for David
and it produced the effect he Intended. Mrs
Woodhull turned pale, and so did the
amiable
Miss Euphrosia.
`Well, she was obstinate and wilful,' said
Mrs Woodhull, as if excusing herself to her
alarmed conscience; `and if a mother isn't
allowed to manage her own children, I
wonder
who is?'
`Well,' said the pale and guilty Miss
Euphrosia
,
`I'm sure sure I never treated her
bad!'
`Well, you'll hear on her agin, I reckon, in
a way you won't like,' said David, grown
bold at his success, and inwardly rejoiced that
his favorite had shown such spirit as to
escape
from the tyranny which he daily
witnessed
,
but could not prevent.
`Now, I guess, you'd better hold, your
peace, David Woodhull,' said his wife,
letting
her wrath, her fears, and shame, all fall
upon him; `if I catch you saying your soul
is your own, if Biddy should ever peach me,
I'll make this house and farm too hot to hold
you.'
With this characteristic menace, the
several
inmates of the family separated to their
rooms to dress, variously affected by the
extraordinary
discovery they had made. Biddy
had flown! The mild, gentle, submissive
Biddy, had run away! Mrs Woodhull had
to repeat it over a dozen times to be able to
realize a truth so astounding; and when she
did, trembled at the consequences that it
might lead to, and she repented, when too
late, that she had been so strict and
tyrannical
a mother to her. Her conscience told her
that Biddy was right in flying from home;
her fears pictured to herself the escaped
prisoner
making her complaint before the village
magistrate, or, what was still more to be
dreaded, the terrible New York Police.
Leaving her and her amiable daughters to
their wonders and conjectures over the
mysterious
disappearance of Biddy, and trembling
at the personal consequences to themselves,
we will follow, the lovely girl to the
intelligence-office
,
to which we left her on her way,
escorted by Bruin and the negro.
PART III.
Biddy
followed her African guide by a
marvellously
crooked way, which none but a
negro
could have taken, through lanes and cross
streets, up alleys, and across squares, and
turning corners, `till her own head turned
with the bewilderment, confusion and noise,
that prevailed around her; her temples ached
with the roar of wheels, and her feet, familiar
only with the green sward, were pained by
traversing the unaccustomed pavements. At
length he stopped in front of a low, two story
wooden building, situated in a close, crowded
street. It had a flashy yellow front, and the
window-shutters and sides of the open doors,
were covered with written and printed
placards
,
headed, `Wants.' Biddy looked up,
and saw on a little sign hanging above her
head from a projecting iron bar, `Intelligence
Office,' done in gold letters upon a brilliant
blue ground. On little tin plates tacked up
each side of the entrance, she also read the
same words.
`Yes, this is it,' she said to the negro `I
am glad I have found it, for I am very tired.
Here is your pay for bringing my bundle,'
she added, tendering him the last shilling she
possessed; `the kind coachman offered to pay
you, but I would rather do it myself. You
must tell him I did so, now.'
`Trus' nigger for dat, missus,' said the
black, with a grin, and extending his sable
thumb and finger for the piece of money;
`I'se tell him, fac' sure!'
`I hope you will, good fellow, for I wouldn't
like to have a stranger pay for me,' said
Biddy
,
with that natural independent spirit we
has already shown she possessed.
`Nebber you f'ar, missus; I'se too much ob
gem'lan to do any ting unhon'ble,' said the
black, lifting his ragged cap, and making a
scrape; `I is sure tell him, missus!'
With this assurance he laid the bundle on
the shelf of the office window, and with his
eyes fixed misgivingly on Bruin, moved off at
a slip shod gait to the next corner, around
which he had no sooner disappeared, than he
struck up a double shuffle on the side-walk,
keeping time with his hands against his thighs,
in the merriest manner. He kept this up for
about a minute; and then said, chuckling
`Ki! yah, yah, yah! Sam Jonsing hab
play de financy, dis time, right up stair, an'
no mistake! Little Missus tink I no make
Boss Dick plank de prog too! Yah!
Elebenteen
pence for car' bundle! Him short
ten-cent
piece, I 'clar!' he added, looking
closely
at it; `she cheat niggar out ob two cent
an' half a one! ki? I'll make Boss Dick pay
his six pence. How she tink nigger
gen'l'man
keep him word, ven de vhite gen'l'mans
don't. Yes, sartin sure, Sam Jonsing, you
is defalter dis bressed mornin', an' no
mistake
.'
Here Sam pocketed his silver, and shuffled
off to No. 21, Bowery, where the rogue was
again paid by honest Dick Sherwood, on his
making oath over the handle of Dick's whip,
that he had taken both the bundle and the
young woman safely to her destiuation.
Biddy's eyes had unconsciously followed
her late guide 'till they could see him no
longer, when she felt as if she had parted with
the last link that bound her to her species.
She sighed at the sense of her condition, and
tears came unbidden to her eyes.
Suppressing
them with an effort, she stopped down,
and carressed Bruin and soon recovered her
self-possession. On looking about her, she
saw that several females, old and young, and
chiefly Irish, were standing on the side-walk,
conversing in little knots, or waiting with
anxious looks in the door-way. There were
two large square windows, projecting, one on
either side of the narrow door leading into
the office. These windows were filled with
hills and placards, all expressing the wants
of individuals in nearly every condition of life.
Her attention was particularly fixed by some
written notices, wafered upon the shutter
against which she leaned to rest herself, her
hand upon her bundle, which lay upon the
shelf of the window, and with Bruin at her
feet. How her eyes beamed with hope, as she
read with breathless interest a long list of
wants
. As she felt confident she had only to
offer herself to obtain a situation.
`Now,' thought she, `as there are so many
for me to choose from, I shall hardly know
how to choose. `A smart girl for general
house work, she said, repeating to herself
the first notice; `that must he something like
my work at home! I can't choose
that
. `
Apprentice
to learn straw-sewing.' That must
be pleasanter than general house work. But
then I'm told they work the apprentices to
death in this city, and that any of them can
be told in passing them in the streets, by their
pale and sickly looks, and thin persons. I
would rather work hard, I think, (if it is
thought more genteel to be a 'prentice,) as a
house girl! `Neat girl for general house
work!' Here is one wanted just my age,
where the work is light. This is better than
at home, and perhaps I might find kindness.
I will keep this in my mind. A first rate
sewer to make dresses.
That I should like
'
I can sew well, and always make my own
dresses? I'll think of this place too.'
Thus did our heroine run over in her
thoughts the several situations so temptingly
proffered to all in need of employment, and in
their multiplicity and variety, her mind was
lost! She, for some time, could come to no
decision, but finally decided on one or the
other of the advertisements, viz; the second
and fourth? So absorbed had she been in
forming her resolution, that she blushed, and
blushed, and became confused and vexed, on
looking round, and seeing that half a dozen
Irish and Scotch girls standing before the
office
,
had been all the time making themselves
merry at the absorbing attention with which
she was scanning these placards. Pouting
her beautiful lips as girls of sixteen sometimes
will do, when offended, she took up her
bundle
,
and entered the office. It was a deep,
narrow room, with a desk latticed in all round,
on the left, near the door, and a long wooden
bench placed against the opposite wall its whole
length. On this bench were seated some
twenty females of all ages, from ten to fifty
years; waiting for situations as nurses, cooks,
chambermaids, seamstresses, etc. The
majority
of them, thought Biddy, seemed very
contented at sitting there and having nothing
to do all the forenoon; and she saw that they
amused themselves with watching those
coming
in and going out, and listening to the
negociations
of the man behind the desk, with
those who were applicants for places. Biddy
dropped her veil before the gaze of so many
rude and insulting eyes, for she felt that each
one looked upon all subsequent comers as
interlopers
and rivals, who might possibly
forestall
them in a place. Notwithstanding the
occasional laughter, and childish romping of
the poor creatures together, she could not but
see the envy and hatred rankled in their
breasts towards one another. Most of them
were neater dressed than she expected to see
servants that were `out of place,' and all,
without exception, wore red or white cotton
shawls, and brown cotton gloves. It seemed,
to herso much they looked and dressed alike
to be an Intelligence Office uniform!
Nearly
all of them were pock-marked, and scarce
one face in the whole was good looking.
Biddy made these observations at a glance,
and with a sinking heart took a seat beside an
old woman in iron spectacles, plaited cap, and
an old second hand quaker bonnet; who
seeing
her waiting till the Intelligence office
man had got through with a gentleman who
had just come in, and who wanted a child's
nurse, had made room for her to be seated.
She felt grateful for the offer, for she was
both fatigued and embarrassed. She felt, too,
that by a little delay, she could see how
business
was done, and the experience might be
of service to her in enabling her to apply for
herself in a proper form. Shrinking from
observation
,
she drew her veil half aside, and
observed what passed that she might profit by
it; for she keenly felt her utter ignorance and
helplessness now that the crisis of her
position
approached. Her first glance was
directed
towards the desk. Within the latticed
enclosure, sat a little, thin, sallow man, with
brushy, black hair, a low, fleshy forehead,
keen black eyes, a long sharp nose, and a
large lipped, ugly mouth, filled with decayed
and snaggled teeth. He wore half whiskers,
very long and silky, a white cravat and a black
coat of three fashions agone. Such was the
untoward appearance of Beal Tucker! He
looked like a snivelling, mean man, who would
sell his soul for three pence, and his heart and
character did not belie his looks. In his
fingers
he held a counting-house steel pen; a
book of entries lay open before him, and he
was looking up beneath his covert eye-brows,
listening to the gentleman who was giving
him through the bars of the lattice a
description
of the kind of servant he wanted.
`Yes, sir, I think I can suit you to a
t
,' said
Beal Tucker, dropping his large black brows,
and examining the book in which he recorded
the names, ages, character, occupation, and
address of the applicants for situation, on
receipt
,
in advance, of fifty cents from each
applicant
,
who, by this
douccur
, became entitled
to his services for a period of three months to
aid in obtaining them places. Without this
payment in advance, and the registering of
the names on his book, no one, though sitting
in his office, could be allowed to take a
situation
that persons called on him to have
filled
.
Biddy had yet to learn this disagreeble
fact! `Yes, sir,' said Beal Tucker, after
examining
the book, `I have one here that will
just
suit you. What is your address?'
`'Tis here,' said the gentleman, giving him
a card.
`Ah, yes! Mr. Sancroft!' said Mr.
Tucker
,
in a humming half tone, and drawing near
another book in which he entered the names
of those who wanted servants, he quietly
recorded
the address in a very handsome hand,
of which he evidently was proud as one of his
numerous accomplishments.
`Is she here present?' asked the gentleman,
a young married man, looking round with
visible
confusion upon the array of woman's eyes
that sought his, each female hoping to be
herself
selected.
`Yes,' replied Beal Tucker, coldly.
`I should like to see her.'
Beal extended his hand, with the palm
significantly
turned upwards, and said in a bland
voice
`Fifty cents, if you please.'
`For what?' asked the novice in
Intelligence
offices.
`For registering your name, and sending
a nurse to you,' answered Beal, with a sneer
of contempt at the gentleman's greenness.
`But she may not suit.'
`I will then send you another and another,
'till you get one that suits you. I cannot pay
rent for a room for girls to sit in all day, 'till
people come and take 'em away to places,
nothing for it.'
The
gentleman seemed to see the force of
his reasoning, and placed a half dollar in
Beal's extended palm. The fingers
instinctively
closed over it, and something like a
smile gleamed in his eyes.
`Mary Cotter!' he called aloud, like a
school-master to a pupil. `Mary Cotter!
where is she?' he asked angrily, opening his
latticed door, and looking over the room.
Every head was turned in search, and at
length there was a general exclamation from
the women that she had gone out.
`Then she deserves to lose her place,' said
Beal, petulantly. `Hush that noise and
jabbering
there, in the further part of the room,
he shouted to two or three young Irish girls
of fourteen or fifteen years of age, beating
each other with their bonnets, to the
amusement
of those around. `If I hear any more
noise, I'll turn you out!'
All was still as death, for Beal's voice was
like thunder, and carried terror with it to the
hearts of his unruly petticoat subjects.
`Here's a young American girl,' he added,
`wanted to take care of a babyexperienced
and good character, and all that! Who wants
the place?'
There was a general movement of heads
but no one replied.
`Is there no American girl here?'
`Yes, sir, I'm one,' said a thin,
shabby-respectable
old maid, who, poor creature!
looked
as if she had drank the cup of poverty to
its very dregs; and she came with a
hesitating
step towards the desk.
There was a general scornful titter among
the Irish women and wenches, as the
applicant
,
with her left arm hugging together the
fore part of her lank garments, laid her right
hand, bony and blue with famine and time,
upon the corner of the desk. Biddy's
generous
spirit resented this unfeeling expression
of their scorn, but she reflected that they were
all perhaps nearly equally as wretched as the
victim of it, and had no pity or compassion to
spare for others. It is the degraded poor who
are ever the most bitter and unfeeling to the
poor and miserable.
`Yes, you're American what there is left of
you,' said Beal Tucker, with a laugh at his
wit; `the gentleman don't want a frame, I
guess! I' thinkin' he'd rather get a nurse as
is already got her flesh laid on.'
`No good woman,' said the gentleman,
seeing
she shrunk from the cruel language of
the unfeeling brute, `I fear you will not quite
suit me; I want a young and healthy person!
Perhaps this will atone for your
disappointment
!'
and he placed a dollar in her hand.
`That's what I call throwing pearls before
swine, if I might be so bold,' said Beal, who
witnessed this generosity with surprise.
`She'll get drunk before night.'
`Indeed, sir, I never get drunk,' said the
woman, earnestly.
`Don't tell me
no
, when I say
yes!
Go to
your seat or off out o' the way; its no use
for you to stay here any longer Nobody'll
come for you but the doctors.'
`I have paid you my half a dollar Mr Beal,'
said the poor woman pleadingly.
`And you have been loafing here nearly
three months on it.'
`There sits a young person whose
appearance
prepossesses me,' said the gentleman,
disgusted, and wishing to change the subject;
`call her this way.'
`Jane Mannus, the gentleman wants to
speak to you, come up to the desk,' said Beal
sternly. `Here, you old hag of bones, stand
out of the way, and make room!'
`Are you an American girl?' asked the
gentleman
,
of a very pretty, modest,
ruddy-cheeked
lass, of about sixteen, with brown hair
laid neatly on either cheek, and large, clear
blue eyes,
She hesitated, colored, and dropped her
eyes, though not before she had caught Beal's
meaning glance for her to say `Yes.' After
a moment's silence she looked up, and with a
frank, open countenance, said
`I will not belie my counthry, sir, for the
sake of getting a situation. I am an Irish
girl.'
`How long have you been in this country?'
asked the gentleman, smiling, and as much
pleased with the blunt honesty of her reply,
as Beal was vexed by it.
`Sinct I was eight year, sir.'
`You may send this young woman to my
house at four o'clock,' said the gentleman,
turning to Beal; `she will, perhaps, suit us.'
`Very well, sir, she shall be there,' said the
Intelligence office keeper, as the gentleman
left his little despotic empire. Then writing
upon a printed card prepared with blanks, his
address, with her name and occupation
beneath
it, he gave it to her with the injunction
to be at the place designated, precisely at four
o'clock. Jane received it with a curtsy, and
soon after left the office, elated with the
prospect
of getting `a place.'
Biddy, our heroine, had silently observed
all that had transpired, and she found that she
had learned something by seating herself
down and waiting. She felt delighted to see
with what ease places were obtained by those
suitable to fill them. But she had much yet
to learn.
`All I have got to do,' she said to herself,
`is to ask him who it is that wants a straw
sewer, or a girl for light housework, and he
gives me a ticket and sends me to the place!
What excellent things these Intelligence
offices
are for poor girls! Now if I had to pay
the half dollar, instead of the person that
should want me, what would I do when I
haven't a cent in my purse!' I will not be
afraid of these women here, but go right up
and ask him before some other person gets the
place!'
As she came to this resolution, a
melancholy-looking
young woman came into the
office, and approached the desk. Everything
she had on was faded, and she was without
stockings. Beal Tucker eyed her sharply
through the bars, and then said abruptly
`Well what's your business?'
`I want to get a place, sir,' she said
meekly
.
`Place is a broad word! One would think
there was but one place, or you was the one
for all places!' and the Intelligence office
lord chuckled at his own wit, and looked
around upon the Irish and Scotch women for
applause. In the eyes of servants seeking
`place,'be it observed, in passingan
Intelligence
office man is a very great man, and
by and by he very naturally begins to think
he is so himself! Beal Tucker was, in his
own opinion, a
very
great man!
`I meant no offence, sir,' said the young
woman.
`No, ah. no, I guess you didn't! I guess
you'd know better than to give offence to
me
.' No young woman nor old woman never
did it! No one would
dare
do it!'
`I'm sure they wouldn't, sir,' said the
applicant
,
humbly.
Beal was pleased and mollified by the
manner
in which she spoke this, and said blandly,
`Well, what place do you want? here's
cooks, chambermaids, all house-work,
seamstresses
,
child's nurses, lady's maidsevery
thing but wives! and I might supply them
too for a fair premium! he, he, ho, ha!'
`I'd like a situation to do house work, sir.'
`You are too delicate, young woman. A
seamstress would suit you better.'
`Oh, no, sir! It's sewing that has injured
meworking fifteen hours a day, and no
exercise
,
and earning, at that, but two shillings
a day. I wish to do house work, sir.'
`Well, I'll look out for you. Where's your
half dollar?'and Beal Tucker's palm lay
open upward on his desk, before her.
Tremblingly she drew from the bosom of her
faded frock a bit of green silk. She unfolded
it with a sigh, and displayed to the greedy
eyes of Mr. Beal Tucker, the whole of her
little store, viz: three quarter dollar pieces,a
pistareen, a ten cent piece, three pennies, and
a soiled Murphy's omnibus ticket. She
separated
two of the quarters, and placed them,
with another sigh, in his hand. Biddy, all
forgetful of her own needful situation, pitied
her, and wished she could pay the half dollar
for her. But instantly the thought flashed
upon her, `How shall I pay it for myself?'
Poor Biddy! how, indeed, was she to pay
for herself? Now that she saw farther into
the mysteries of intelligence offices, she did
not think they were altogether just the
benevolent
institutions for aiding young females she
at first believed them to be.
[1]
[1]
Since the occurrence of this story,
gratustovs
es have been established by benevolent societies.
Now that she
discovered that servants seeking places were
charged half a dollar, as well as those who
came to seek for servants, she became very
much embarrassed, and her self-possession,
for a few moments, nearly deserted her. What
should she do? She must obtain some
situation
before the day closed, but to obtain it, she
must
pay in advance!
`Oh, where shall I
get this money? what shall I do?' were
questions
which she put to herself fifty times.
She looked round upon the women in the
office
,
for some kind, sympathizing face, for she
felt like seeking and asking sympathy. But
every one looked selfish and forbidding. Her
eyes then sought the harsh visage of Mr.
Beal Tucker, against whom she had already
conceived a prejudice. But she could read
only in his countenance, avarice and half
dollars
.
Poor Biddy! she was in a sad
perplexity
.
At one time the idea struck her, of
going
from house to house, and asking for
employment
,
as this course would not require
money. But a seecond reflection convinced
her of its folly, and probable frultless issue;
else, if it were possible, why did not the poor
women around her, ill able to spare a half
dollar, pursue this course, and save their
money
?
Tears at length filled her eyes, and
drawing her thick green veil over her face,
she let them trickle freely, for it relieved her
heavy heart.
`What ails thee, my pretty miss?' at length
asked the old woman in the faded quaker
bonnet
,
who had asked her to take a seat beside
her.
`I am without money,' said Biddy, hastily
drying her eyes, snd speaking with that
frankness
of innocence which conceals nothing
from the designing. `I did not expect to have
to pay.'
`So you thought to get a place for nothing;
he, he, he! Poor child! you don't know
Intelligence
offices well as I does.'
Biddy thought she had known full enough
of them, and felt no inclination to learn more.
Encouraged by the old woman's sociable
mood, she ventured to ask her if she thought
`the intelligence man' would not get her a
place, if she would promise to pay him with
her first wages.
`Well, sich things has been done, when
folks is known; I'll ax him for you.'
`I wish you would,' said Biddy, with
grateful
earnestness, `for I haven't courage to do
it myself.'
`I'll do it, poor thing!' she said, good
naturedly
;
`but then I don't think but with
your pretty face you'd do better with Beal
Tucker than an old woman. There's them as
knows him, says he likes a bright eye; and
what intelligence man don't? I can tell you,
miss, there's young girls been sent from these
places more than once, that wan't advertized
for in print, by them they went to!'
Biddy would have asked her the meaning
of her words, but she immediately called out
in a shrill tone from where she sat
`Mr. Tucker, here's a young voman as is
without money, and wants to know if as how
you would register her name, for a place, and
let her pay you the `half' from her first wages?'
Biddy's face burned with shame and
confusion
at this open address, and felt that all
eyesas, in truth, they weredirected
towards
her. Twice she caught the old
woman
by the gown to check her, but in vain.
`A young woman without money, hey?'
gruffly repeated Beal Tucker, without
looking
up from an advertisement he was writing
for the morning's paper.
`Yes, and more's the pity, for she has a
pretty face that should bring her gold.'
Whether it was `pretty face,' or the magic
word `gold,' or both that caused Beal
Tucker
to stick his pen on the top of his ear, and
look through his bars towards the speaker and
her confused
protege
, must be left for
determination
after his character shall be more
fully
developed. But certain it is, that he
looked
very hard, and with increasing interest at
Biddy, as one after another the perfections of
her foot, waist and hand, were revealed to his
practiced eye.
`Humph,' he said, after a moment's survey,
which satisfied him that Biddy was of a
superior
order of beauty to any he had seen in
his office, though he had not yet seen her
face, which she kept concealed by her veil.
`Humph!' and he gave a second and closer
survey; which determined his conduct.
`Young, is she, Aunt Kitty, and no money?'
he said, in a tone of mock sympathy; `bad,
very bad!' and Beal Tucker shook his head
as if he had heard she had committed a great
crime. Biddy never before felt that it was so
wicked thing to be without money. Again
Beal scrutinized her. `Suppose, young
woman
,
you put up your veil,' he said, coarsely;
`perhaps, after I see your face, I can tell
whether to trust you or not.'
Biddy's cheek burned at this rude address,
but instinctively raised her hand, and put
aside her veil. If Beal Tucker had been
before
struck with the symmetry of her figure,
he was now filled with surprize at the fresh
and youthful beauty of her face. He would
have started back with an exclamation at this
discovery, but habitual caution enabled him
to restrain all outward expressions of
emotion
.
`Didn't I tell ye she was a pretty one?' said
the keen old woman, exultingly, on observing
the effect which he vainly would have
concealed
even from her penetrating gaze.
`Hush,' woman, he said, in a tone of stern
reproof: `come hither, miss,' he added,
carelessly
nodding to Biddy. She hesitated, when
the old woman, raising her from the bench,
thrust her forward.
`Why don't you go, child? He'll trust
you, I know by his eyehe, he, he! won't
you, Beal Tucker?
`Silence,' thundered Mr. Tucker. `So,
young miss,' he said, assuming the blandest
expression he could bring his forbidding
countenance
to wear, `so you have no money, and
want a place?'
`Yes sir,' answered Biddy, in a low, timid
tone.
`We don't wish to be hard with you.
What place would you like?'
`I saw a straw sewer advertised for sir!'
`That place is taken, I am sorry to say,'
answered Beal, with an insinuating smile,
shaded with regret
`There is a person wanted to make dresses,'
continued Biddy, beginning to feel the first
bitterness of disappointment.
`I am sorry to say that place is also
engaged
,'
said Beal, who gracefully leaned over his
desk in one of his favorite attitudes, and from
which he had not moved since she came
before
him. `Can you think of nothing else?'
`I can do general house work, sir,' said our
heroine, now willing, so embarrassed was her
situation, to accept of any employment that
would relieve her from it.
`House work!' repeated Beal, with
surprize
.
`Oh, no! Go and sit down, if you
please, 'till I get through with some little
business, and I will look over my list and see
what I can do for you.' And all the while
Beal Tucker's eyes were drinking in the
intoxicating
draaght of her beacty.
Biddy felt relieved by his words, and as she
took her seat, began to think she had taken
too hasty a prejudice against him.
It was then about eleven o'clock, and
Biddy
sat there until twelve, a silent observer of
all the singular scenes that transpired. As
the clock struck twelve, Mr. Tucker, who
had been long impatiently waiting to hear it,
briskly shut up his books, and opening the
door of his latticed den, said, in a hasty tone,
`Twelve o'clock! Home to dinner, girls,
and let me to mine. I shan't be open again,
'till two, to-day!'
There was a general preparatory
movement
among the women, and those near the
door began to quit the office. `Home!
dinner
!'
sighed Biddy; `and am I to wander in
the streets 'till two o'clock, perhaps all day,
as he has not asked my name to regester it?'
`Come, miss, with `the pretty face,' don't
block up the way!' said a savage looking
Irish woman, thrusting her rudely aside.
Biddy stepped aside, and stood still until
nearly all had left the office, when,
recollecting
that she must act with more firmness than
she had hitherto shown, she took up her
bundle
to go, and spoke to Bruin, who, all the
while, had lain under the bench, where he
had crouched when she first seated herself.
Beal Tucker had his eyes upon her, however,
and did not mean she should leave without
his seeing her again. She was stepping across
the threshhold, when he artfully called, as if
just accidentally rememebring her presence.
`Oh, young woman, there, in the green
veil! I had like to have forgotten you. Just
wait a moment, and I'll give you a ticket to a
place that I think will just suit you. You can
pay me any time.'
These words, though addressed to Biddy,
were also intended for the ears of the two or
three that lingered in the office, as an excuse
to them for detaining her. She heard him
with a sensation of joy, and hope once mors
shone in her hitherto downcast eyes, as she
turned back. Beal Tucker re-entered hie
desk, and opened one of his books. The old
woman in the quaker bonnet still lingered in
the door. Beal looked at her angrily:
`What do you stay for, old woman? Go!
I'll now just examine my books for you miss.'
`The place you mean to give that miss,
you'll not find on either of them books o'
yourn, Beal Tucker,' said she, chuckling, as
she stepped from the door.
`Begone!' cried Beal, his color heightened
by anger and guilt.
`He he, he!' chuckled the old woman, as
she disappeared from the office.
`Sit down, missthese old women would
vex the ,
devil
, Beal would have said, did
he swear, but being as he often boasted, a
`reg'lar moral man,' he never indulged in
profanity
;
being so strict, therefore, he ended by
substituting `saints' for the devil.
Biddy re-seated herself, pondering in her
mind what the old woman meant, by saying
the place that he intended to give her, was
not found on his books; but she was too young
and innocent of the world, and of evil, to
arrive
at the truth. Beal now pored for a few
moments, seemingly with great earnestness
and interest over his list of entries, but his
eyes, instead of falling on the page, were
scanning, from beneath his pent house brows,
the lovely and ingenuous features of our
heroine
.
At length he seemed to look as if he
had come to some satisfactory decision, to
which he intended to conform his
intermediate
conduct.
`What is your name, miss?'
`Bridget Woodhull, sir,' said Biddy,
looking
up, and answering, while one hand laid
on Bruin's shaggy mane.
He pretended to write it on the book, but
really wrote it on a card, which he had
previously
laid upon the page.
`Where do you live?' he asked, in a low tone
for persons were constantly passing the door.
`Sir!' said our heroine, embarrassed by the
question.
`Where do you live, my dear?'
`In West Chester county, sir.'
`When did you come to the city?'
`This morning, sir, in the stage, to get a
place.'
`Have you worked out before?'
`No, sir.'
`Are you acquainted in the city?'
`No, sir.'
`And you have no money?'
`I gave my last shilling to a black man,
who showed me the office, not knowing I
should have to pay to get a place.'
These questions were answered with a
directness
and frankness singularly contrasting
the duplicity and double intention with which
they were put to her. Beal Tucker looked at
her for a few seconds, and a singular smile
passed across his face. `Yes,' he said to
himself
,
`she shall be sent to him, and he shall
pay well for so rare a treasure. By-the-by,
miss. how came you to leave home?'
`Because, sir, my mother and sister's
treated
me very badly.'
`So you run away, eh?'
`Yes, sir, I did,' answered our heroine, with
mirth mingled embarrassment.
`Better still,' soliloquised Beal Tucker,
rubbing his hands, and showing his snaggled
teeth with secret delight. `It's a fair prize!'
he added, aloud.
`Sir,' said Biddy.
`I said this dust was bad for sore eyes. I
will shut the door 'till I make out your ticket.'
And the plausible Beal Tucker left his chair
and closed the street door, confining it,
unperceived
,
by a finger bolt. He then returned
to his desk.
`What place do you think you would
prefer
,
pretty one?' he said, in a tone of
gallantry
,
and looking, as he conceived, very
loving
.
`A dress maker's, sir,' answered the
unsuspecting
maiden.
`Suppose you just step into the desk, and
look at the list, yourself,' said Beal, in his
most insinuating manner.
By this time, Biddy had discovered, what
every other true woman would have done,
that there was mingled in Mr. Tucker's
manner
,
a good deal of freedom and pretension. In
a man exactly like Beal Tucker, such
demonstrations
could not be very acceptable to any
one: though his victories and frequent
lip-favors
from some of his hideous `out of place'
servants had a tendency to inspire him with
great confidence in his powers in that line
Biddy instinctively felt the moral impurity of
his presencefor a chaste woman, like the
sensitive plant, involuntarily shrinks at
proximity
with a libertine. This instinctive
feeling
or
sense
, Biddy now experienced, and she
began to entertain fears at being in his
presence
.
When, therefore, he desired her to
enter
his desk, she declined, saying, with
firmness
,
`that she would leave it to him to name a
place.'
Beal was struck by the tone and manner,
and looked at her suspiciously, for guilt is
ever on the alert. A glance was sufficient to
tell him she feared him, and had instinctively
divined his feelings towards her. Beal only
intended, however, by inviting her to his desk,
to steal from her ripe lips a kiss: for though
sensual and unprincipled, he loved gold much
better than lust, or the gratification of any
other passion, that he was always prepared to
sacrifice all of them for it. Gold now
protected
Biddy, not only from baser designs, but
even from the insult to her modesty that he
had intended; for he meant to be paid in gold
coin, even for the kiss he feared to take, now
that he saw she knew him. Besides, Beal
Tucker had a wife up stairs, and he had come
to a conclusion, in order to forward a purpose
he had in view, to invite Biddy to dinner.
`Oh, very well then,' he said, in a tone
which he intended should restore her
confidence
,
`I will act for you.' He then looked
over his entries, and said, `Here is a lady
wants a dress-maker, and will pay good wages.
Will that suit you?'
`Yes, sir.'
`Very well, then, I'll recommend you.'
`I thank you, sir,' said Biddy. `I will be
sure to pay you from my very first wages.'
`No doubt, no doubt,' said Beal, with a
sardonic
smile; `here's your ticket. Let no
one see it, but when you leave here, go
directly
to the house No , Chambers street.'
`Yes, sir,' answered Biddy, about to go.
`No, don't go yet. I dare say you haven't
had breakfast or dinner.'
`No, sir,' answered Biddy, for the first time
conscious of her long fasting.
`Well, then, come into the next door,
upstairs
,
and take dinner with my wife, and stay
there until I get back. You had best give me
the ticket, and I will give it to you again
when I return.'
Beal then opened his door, and stepping to
the next, called up the stairs to his wife
`Mrs. Tucker, I say! Mrs. Tucker.'
A woman with a red head, a red face, and
a red baby in her arms, came to the stair head,
and shrieked back, `Well, what you want,
Beal?'
`Here's a young woman come for a place,
and as I can't attend to her just now, having
business out, give her some dinner, and keep
her until I come in. You understand me.'
Mrs. Tucker understood him. The two were
not only one, connubially, but in all else.
`Yes, Beal, send her up. Oh, there she is.
Come up, miss.'
Biddy, who at first, resolved not to go with
Mr. Tucker to his dinner, on hearing a
woman's
voice in reply, took confidence, and
with the faithful Bruin bounding after her,
went up stairs at her invitation. Beal saw
her safety up, and then gave his wife a
significant
wink; when seeing her return a
comprehensive
glance from her pink edged eyes, he
closed his office, and hastened up the street
towards Broadway.
PART IV.
THE EXQUISITE.
About
half an hour before Beal Tucker
dismissed his flock, and left his office, a young
gentleman opened his eye-lids, and looked
gapingly round a luxurious chamber, but half
lighted by the ray of noonday that streamed
in penciled lines of silver through the closed
shutters. After yawning thrice very loud, and
very long, like one who feels that he is
master
of the premises, he turned himself slowly
over in his bed; he then, with an effort,
raised
himself on his elbow, and showed a
handsome
yet very pale and haggard face, as if he
had been at some late carousal the night
previous
.
He remained in this position,
immoveable
,
full five minutes, the while contorting
his flexible features into hideous and loathing
grimaces, and, at intervals, smacking his
parched palate as if he had a bad taste in his
mouth. At length he raised himself from his
elbow, and sat up in bed, letting his head fall
upon his breast, and his whole person droop
into a trist and depressed attitude. It was
Fitz Henry Barton, the morning after a `dem
fine spree.'
He sat for some time in this very
penitent-looking
position, and at length made an
exertion
to reach his watch from beneath his
pillow. He looked at the time by the faint
light admitted through the shutters, and said
in a weak tone, `Half past elevendem this
wine, I feel sick! Half past eleven! Frid!
Frid, I say!'
There was no answer, for his black servant,
Frederick, was holding a
tete-a-tete
out of the
library window, with the yellow chambermaid
in the chamber window of the next house.
`Frid! you dem Frid!' replied Mr. Fitz
Henry Barton in a louder key; but his voice
was not yet strong enough to penetrate the
door.
After listening awhile, and finding he was
not heard, he slid down from the side of the
bed, crossed to the fire place, and gave the
bell a very fierce pull for such a quiet person
as he was. The jingling started the
chambermaid
from the window, to put the forgotten
coverlid on her bed, and the
valet
from his, to
hasten to wait on his master.
`Wat in the devil deu you mean, Frid, by
not being in the way when I awake?'
remonstrated
Mr. Fitz Henry Barton, in a nervous
tone of petulent anger. `Don't you know I
always want you by me when I wake?'
`Beg pardon, massa,' said the genteel valet,
opening one of the upper shutters, and
hastening
to put his master's dressing gown upon
him; `I vas jis comin' vhen I hears massa
ring.'
`I tell you, Frid, you must always be at the
door; what can I do alone by myself, when
I wake up? It's dem unhandsome, in you,
Frid!' he said, in a complaining voice.
`I know it, massa.' said Frederick, with a
downcast look; `an' I promises neber gib
offence
ebber no more.'
`Now see you don't, Frid, an' I'll maybe
forgive you this time! Where's my
gin-cocktail
?
Don't you know I am good for nothing
just like a dem rag in the mornin', 'till I
get my gin-cock-tail? Don't you know that,
Frid!
`Yes, massa,' said Frederick, placing Mr.
Fitz Henry Barton's Indian moccasin's on his
feet, and then going towards a marble slab in
one corner of the room, on which stood empty
champaign bottles, glasses, decanters, etc.
There was also upon it a ready made
gin-cock-tail
,
which he placed on a silver salver
and brought it to his master. The sick and
miserable Barton seized hold of it with a
nervous
hand, and putting it to his lips as a
thirsty
man would a draught of fresh spring water,
drank off the strong and bitter tonic
concocted
of gin, sugar, and `Sloughton,'
Those who have never dissipated at night,
and, in consequence, awakened late after it
the next morning, can know nothing of the
misery, bodily and mental, the victims of wine
parties suffer! Horror in mind, and
depression
of bodyfever of the brain, sickness at
heart, with the mind tortured by imaginary
fears of evil, that no mental effort can shake
off, make the situation of the walking
debauchee
a foretaste of infernal torture! To drown
this horrid night-mare of the waking
inebriate
,
recourse is had to artificial stimulants to
create opposite sensations: and as, also, the
body is relaxed by its previous idulgence, its
tone and nerve must be restored by the same
means? It is this which makes intemperance
so difficult to care; for the debility and horrors
consequent on to-day's inebriation, must be
drowned by astrong potation the first moment
of waking on the morrow. So the drunkard
goes on. Till even stimulus ceases to act
upon the nervous and depressed system, and
he sinks into an early grave.
As none who have not experienced it, can
appreciate the misery of the first waking
moments
of a man after a night's intemperance,
neither can any such form an idea of the
magic
effect of a gin-cock-tail or a glass of bitters
in dissipating it. No sooner had Fitz Henry
Barton drank off, with many a wry mouth,
the restoring morning draught `Frid' had
mixed for him, than a change came over him
as instant as it was striking. His eyes,
before
heavy and laden, lighted up, his white
lips became red, his pale check ruddy with
the hitherto stagnant blood, and his whole
person seemed to become animate and elastic
with new life and vigor. He looked no
longer
the wretched and pitiable object he had
been a few minutes before; but his face wore
a buoyant air, and his voice, as he spoke, was
natural and firm, though something elated.
Such was the magic effect of a strong draught
on the debauchee! But the victim of it, in
quaffing it, had made compact for the through
out, with the demon of the intemperate: for
having given his spirits the pitch to which
health and sobriety keep those of temperate
men, he was under the necessity of keeping
them up to that point by successive potations
through the day, or fall again into that hell
of depression from which it had lifted him!
If Fitz Henry Barton could have had
resolution
enough to encounter, and bear for a day
or two, the horrors with which he waked each
morning, he would soon have found that
temperance
would give him that elasticity and
happiness of spirits which he now foolishly
sought for in successive potations of
intoxicating
poison! The
first day
in a drunkard's
reform
,
is the great day of his trial! Perhaps
when the hour approaches in which the
reformed
inebriate is accustomed to take his
dram, which he has resolved no more to touch,
it is the most miserable of his life! The first
dram
given up
, is the most effective blow to
the chain of his slavery. A drunkard
resolutely
withstanding the temptation to drink
while the hour he is accustomed to indulge in
passing away, presents a moral spectacle that
angels may gaze upon with admiration and
astonishment. Such denial is God-like. The
human mind singly itself, can accomplish
nothing morrally greater! But we are not
writing an essay on intemperance!
Fitz Henry Barton was a new man now
that he had taken his bitters. Let it not be
be supposed from the forgoing remarks, that
he was an habitual drunkard! He was no
more so than a great many young men of his
rank, who yet hold their position in society.
He never was seen staggering in the streets,
unless by watchmenbut then he didn't care
for `Charlies.' No one ever saw him drunk
in Broadway! He could `carry a good deal,'
as the phrase is, and his systematic drinking
through the day, began to show its effects
only towards evening. And all gentlemen,
it was expected, would be a little lively after
dinner; particularly fashionable young men!
Oh, no; Mr. Fitz Henry Barton was no
common
drunkard! Besides his gin-cock-tail on
rising, and a glass of wine bitters just before
breakfast, to give him an appetite, he never
took anything 'till two hours afterwards, when
he would chance to drop into the Astor or
Globe, where he always found some friends.
With them, in the course of an hour, he
would take a brandy sling, after a while,
a rum julap, and then, perhaps a gin sling.
He would then walk Broadway, and, possibly
in his way, stop in at the City Hotel, or the
Washington, and take another gin sling. As
the dinner hour approaches, say an hour
before
it, he would take a gin-cock-tail to
correct
his stomach, and half an hour afterwards
a `wine bitters;' a quarter of an hour before
dinner, he would take another with a `little
more bitters,' and a few moments before
dining
,
take a gin-cock-tail, made stiff with
`Stoughtons.' Such was Mr. Fitz Henry's
usual daily routine of drinking, for each glass
he took, craved its successive one, and he
changed his drinks as the different degrees of
depression of his spirits and system, made it
necessary. There are a great many `
moderate
drinkers' like Fitz Henry Barton! At
dinner he never had any appetite, and
loathed
his food. He could eat nothing without
vinegar upon it; his whole taste was vitiated
and palled. He would drink but little wine
at the table, for its taste was insipid to him,
compared with spirits, and when he dined at
home, alone, he always substituted brandy.
After dinner he always took a tumbler of stiff
brandy and water, and then drove out to
Burnham's, or on the avenue. Yet with all
this drinking, Fitz Henry Barton managed to
get along through each day, without exposing
himself in any marked way, but every night
he went to bed more or less drunk. He
could toe a line, so well he preserved his
self-possession
,
while walking home, but once in
his door and hid from the public eye, he would
stagger through the hall, and often have to be
carried to bed by his faithful `Frid.
`Well, Frid,' he said, in a cheerful tone,
as he now felt the bitters warming in his
veins, `what have you got for my breakfast,
hey, boy?'
`Omulet, nice ham, and coffee, Massa
Barton
,'
said Frid, placing his cravat and vest
beside him, and otherwise assisting him in his
toilet.
`I made him already,' said Frid, grinning.
`I know massa want him dis mornin'.'
`How did you know that, Frid?' asked his
master, arranging his chin, whiskers and
mustache
before the mirror.
`I members well you always axes for black
tea de mornin's after you wommit in de hall.'
`Pah, beast! you make me sick! Yes, I
was ill last night, dem'd ill, Frid.'
`Any body'd know dat,' answered Frid.
`Did I totterthat is, did I staggerfrom
weakness, I mean, Frid.'
`Yes, Massa Barton, e-yah, yah, yah! and
you took me for a watchman, and giv' me a
black eye.'
`Capital, ha, ha, hah; So I gave you a
black eye, Frid?' repeated Mr. Barton,
laughing
immoderately, and evidently much
gratified
at this feat. `Let me see, Frid!'
And the valet removed a handkerchief
which his master had not before noticed he
had tied over one eye, and displayed the
swollen
member.
`Ha! excellent! Scientific! Neatly put.
Frid, eh? I have some science in my
knuckels
,
hey?'
`Werry scientifically done, Massa Barton,'
said the good natured Frid, covering his eye
again. `Now, massa, as you have made you
toilum, all but de boots and coat, please walk
into breakfast.'
With these words Frid opened a door, and
Mr. Fitz Henry Barton, wrapped in his Indian
dressing-gown, indolently rising from his
velvet
arm-chair passed through, while he held
it open, into a small but elegant library. The
book-cases, and also one case of rare shells,
were of rose wood gilt; the books gorgeous
with gold and ornamental binding; the
carpet
rich, and returning no sound to the
footstep
;
the ceiling beautifully painted in fresco,
by the inimitable pencil of a distinguished
fresco painter in New-York; and the sides
lined with crimson fantenils and low
ottomans
!
It was altogether a
recherche
apartment
.
But Mr. Fitz Henry Barton was a
rich young man and loved such outward
testimonials
of opulence. Near the centre of
the room, stood a small round breakfast table.
He threw himself into an arm chair beside it.
Frid handed him a paper, which he had
opened
and dried for him, and then poured out his
black tea. Mr. Fitz Henry glanced with a
fashionable air over the columns of the paper,
and not seeing any thing that particularly
struck his fancy, threw it on the carpet with
a
`Pshaw! the papers are losing all their wit:
Nobody used up this morning! no
crimcons
!
no interesting police reports! no pretty
gearls brought up! no run-a-way matches,
no seductions, no murder cases!'
Here Mr. Fitz Henry Barton took a slip
of black tea, and nibbled a bit of dry toast.
But he evidently ate because he felt nature
required it. He seemed to relish nothing.
Beside him stood his usual glass of
wine-bitters
untouched. He looked at it two or three
times, as if he would stretch his hand for it,
but some association made his taste revolt,
and each time he turned from it with a
loathing
`pah!'
`I don't know what's the matter with me.
Frid: I feel worse than usual;' and he placed
his delicate hand on his stomach. `Frid, I
think you may give me another cock-tail!'
`Yes, Massa, said Frid, hastening to obey.
`No, no, these dem cock-tails don't agree
with me this morning! Give me a wine glass
of pure gin, with a dash of
marischino
on the
top! I think that will doI feel so faint
about the stomach! You did'nt make the
cock-tail strong enough.'
The truth was, that Mr. Fitz Henry
Barton's
stomach began to crave something
stronger each day; spirit weakened with
water, could no longer continue to act upon
it. He felt this to be the case, and for the first
time in his life, resorted to clear spirits. He
drank off the fiery liquid which Frid handed
him, and after the unpleasant burning in his
palate had gone off, he confessed to Frid that
he felt much better. `Very much better.'
`Yes, Frid,' he said with earnestness, `gin
and marischino is the thing! Its a drink for
a gentleman. Dem gin-cock-tails! What do
you drink, yourself, Frid?'
`I never drinks,' answered Frid.
`True, that is proper. None but
gentleman
should drink. Ambrosia is for gods, and
gin for gentlemen! understand that Frid. It's
dem Latin I took it from! Has Jack Rawdon
been here to call on me, Frid?'
`No, massa.'
`Jack's a fine feller, Frida dem fine
fellar
.
He has no money but then I lend him,
and so he's always flush! I like Jackdevil
of a fellow among the gearls! Frid, give me
a segar!' Frid obeyed. `Regalias! None but
a gentleman should smoke Regalias! Bought
them at Anderson's! Dem pretty gearl there.
Frid! Jack Rawdon and I bet which should
run-away with her. I bought these segars
just to ask her to meet me. She smiled, and
when a dem woman smiles, I alwass takes it
yes, Frid. I went to the place in the Park,
and met, instead, her dem brother, a stout
handsome dem sailor feller. He set upon me
and would have whipped me but for my
science
,
Frid. I have kept away from
Anderson's
since. Jack and I have found out
seven
pretty gearls we mean to try and seduce.
It's ripe fun for us young bloods! Two of
them are milliner's apprentices; one of 'em
keeps in a confectionary store, and one is a
widow's daughter; the others, I believe, are
snug little chamber maids. There is another
I have in my eye, Frid, down in the country,
and if Ned Morris stays in Charleston much
longer, I'll drive down there, and run off with
her. Ned, you must know, has taken a shine
to her, and he's so dem'd virtuous, it'll do him
no good to flirt with her! I'm half a dem'd
mind to drive down there to-day! There's
fine sport for a man of mettle in New-York,
Frid! Do you know I keep a man in pay, to
look out for pretty nice gearls from the country
for me? Well, I do! and he's driven more
than one pretty fish to my net. I pay well,
you know. I don't mind money.
Thus the fashionable Mr. Fitz Henry
Barton
ran on from the effects of his last
exhilarating
potation, and as he did not expect Frid
to reply at all, and as the prudent valet was
too well accustomed to his master's way to do
so, he might have continued talking 'till he
had revealed all his gallantries to his valet,
and the effervescence of his spirit had passed
off. But just at this instant his street door
bell rung with a sharp business-like pull.
`Eh, demme, Frid! Ther's the bell. If it's
Jack Rawdon, ask him to come up. Jack's a
dem good fellar!'
Frid left the room, and soon returning,
said that a man who refused to give his name,
wanted to see Mr. Barton privately.
`Privately!' repeated the exquisite,
elevating
his eyebrows. `Oh, ah! But how does
he look, Frid?'
Sallow and thin, with black brows, and
black coat,' answered Frid, giving an accurate
description of Beal Tucker.
`Ah yes,' said Barton with a start of pleased
anticipation, `I think I know who he is!
Show him in, Frid.'
Beal Tucker, who had waited in the hall,
now entered the library and made a very low
and sycophantic how to the elegant occupant
but Beal Tucker did reverence to the
representative
of money, not to the abstract man,
for with all his low cunning and avarice he
had a true knowledge of men, and
particularly
of the personage before him. Mr. Tucker
therefore, bowed very respectfully to Mr.
Barton
,
who gave him a sort of familiarly
condescending
half nod, at the same time saying, in
the affected tone he assumed before all but his
man, Frid.
`How ar' ye, Tucker? I'm just at my
breakfast, you parceive! Fashionable to
breakfast
at noon! Nobility in England all do it,
my boy!'
`Yes, sir,' said Beal; `and I don't see when
a 'Merican gentleman is rich, why he shouldn't
do and act like any noble of 'em all. Its
money makes the man, in my 'pinoin, Mr.
Barton.'
As this was rather equivocal flattery, Mr.
Fitz Henry Barton choose to notice it only by
a doubtful stare; and then waving his right
hand for Mr. Beal to take a seat, he waved
his left for Fred to quit the room. There was
a moment's silence on the part of the
par
nobile
fratrum
after the valet left the library,
which was occupied by Mr. Barton in
smoothing
the coat of his segar by rolling it between
his thumb and fore-finger, and by Mr. Beal in
twisting his old black hat round between his
knees by the string of the inside leather. At
length he looked up beneath his beetle brows,
and, to do him justice, looking very mean and
guilty, and said, hesitatingly
`Wall, Mister Barton, I've called to see
you on that little matter of business we had a
talk about onct. I hope we are alone!'
`Yes, Tucker, quite alone. So you have
come to tell me you have some dem pretty
rural!'
`Why not exactly so, Mister Barton, at
least just yetbut'
`But whatdem it, Tucker, you have lost
your speech!'
`I only wanted to know if you are
willing
to give me what you promised me if I send
you a nice young girl from the country?'
`Yesfrom the country! I would'nt give
twenty dem dollars for one of these pert,
hackneyed
city girls that, if they continue
virtuous
,
loose all that pretty bashful modesty
that's so dem delightful, you know, Tucker!
I'm tired of the city dem beauties, and want
to have something unsophisticated!'
`And you will give me one hundred dollars
if I will send you such a one?' asked Beal
Tucker, his eyes lighting up in anticipation
of soon possessing this sum.
`Pon honor!that is, if she is pretty and
young, and rural!' said Mr. Fitz Henry
Barton
,
throwing his head back in his chair, and
exhaling the tobacco smoke from his pipe in a
long spiral wreath towards the painted ceiling.
`Will you give me that in writing. Mr.
Barton? asked the cautious Beal.
`Why, Tucker,' said Barton, carelessly,
`it would be dem'd awkward, you know, for
both of us if such a writing should, by
accident
,
be seen by any body else. I cannot put
anything on paper.'
`She is a very beautiful, and not a day over
sixteen,' said Tucker, artfully. `If you should
see her you'd double the money.'
`Demnition, Tucker,' cried Barton, starting
with pleased surprise, `then you have one at
your office!'
`Not in my office exactly,' said he,
evasively
,
`but in the city.'
`Young?'
`Sixteen, not a month over.'
`Beautiful?'
`She will astonish you when you see her
as much as she did me. I never beheld a
prettier countenace!'
`Fine figure?'
`Perfect, from head to feet
`Tall or short?'
`Middling height.'
`Dark or fair?'
`A clear brunette.'
`When did she come to the city?'
`This morning.'
`And is now?
`At my house.'
`Done. Send her here and the money is
yours!'
`Give me your hand on it, Mr. Barton,'
said the wary villian; and he extended his
dark thin hand towards the exquisite.
`Dem and demnition, Tucker!' cried Mr.
Fitz Henry Barton shrinking back from the
contact; `do you think I am going to shake
hands with you like two boxers before a
set-to
?'
`I can easily keep the girl from you,' said
Tucker, moodily, and advancing towards the
door. `I don't force her upon you. Pay me
fifty dollars down on the nail, and fifty
tomorrow
,
come!'
`Well, Beal, have it as you will.
Recollect
I trust you altogether here! You know
my taste.'
`She will suit you, or I will give back the
money.'
`Dem the money, Tucker; I want a pretty
girl. There's a
fifty
,' he added, drawing it
from his pocket-book and twisting it across
the table to him, `Now go and send her here
directly. Mind, you let her make no dem
blunder, now.'
`I'll take care for that, Mr. Barton,' said
Beal, placing the note carefully in an old
leather
wallet crammed with advertisements for
servants; `she'll be here before two o'clock!'
`You're a good fellow, Tucker, dem good
fellow. Will you take coffee?'
`Thank youI'm just going home to my
dinner?'
Dinner? My soul, Beal, how can you eat
your dem dinner at one o'clock?'
`By thinking its my breakfast,' said
Tucker, with a sneer, as he was leaving the
room. `Good afternoon, Mr. Barton.'
`Good
morning
to you, Mr, Tucker! Now,
there goes a fellar that dines at one o'clock
and says `Good afternoon' before
dinner
at that. In my opinion its
demnition
vulgar to say `good morning' before
one has dined if it be not till eight o'clock.
But what more can be expected of an
Intelligence
office man? So, I am to have a dem'd
adventure! I must prepare my toilet! Frid,
where are you, Frid?'
`Yes, massa,' said the valet.
`Have you shown the fellar out Frid?'
`Yes, massa.'
`Well, Frid, I'm going to dress now!
Remove
the brikfastassist me at my toilet. I
expect a female visitor on private business.'
`Yes, massa,' said the initiated valet.
`After you show her up, you can lock the
front door, you know, and have the afternoon
to yourself if you want to walk out.'
`Yes, massa,' said Fred, with a pleased
look; and he began very assiduously to aid
his master in his toilet. First Mr. Fitz Henry
Barton took a bath in a handsome and
convenient
bathing-room opening from his bed
chamber. After the bath he threw on his
wrapper and Fred gave him a stiff brandy and
water. He then prepared to dress himself.
Without descending to such particulars as
his silk shirt, his silk drawers and his silk
hose, his stays, and his very fine white linen
with ruffles half an inch wide on the bosoms,
and laced wristbands, we will mention that
he put on a very handsome pair of fawn
colored
pantaloons, made by C. & K., the straps
of which Fred buttoned over morocco pumps.
His braces were elegantly worked with the
needle and the buckles to them were gold.
He then put on a white satin vest and a white
silk cravat, which he, after fifteen minutes
practice, tied with exquisite taste in a square
bow. Fred then dressed and perfumed his
long hair, parting it with the nicest precision
on the left temple; perfumed his mustaches
and whiskers with odoriferous oil of Persia,
delicately sponged his face over with water
and then powdered it with perfumed powder
of pearls. Mr. Fitz Henry Barton then
washed
his hands in sweet scented water, touched
his lips with strong cologne to give them
color
,
picked out a hair from his nose-tip with
tweezers, took a general and then minute
survey
of himself in a full-length mirror, when
his vanity, to which Fred bore his testimony,
pronounced that he was `dressed.'
`I think I'll do, Frid, eh?' he said
approvingly
,
as he surveyed his handsome person,
while it must be acknowledged, he had
dressed
very elegantly. `Now shall I put on a
coat or my Chinese dressing gown sent me by
my friend Kellog from Canton?'
`If massa Barton 'spect to see lady, him
handsome Chinum dressing gown jist de ting
to take 'em eye,' said Frid, whose own eye
had been taken by the rich and brilliant dies
of this elegant garment.
`Well, Frid, I believe I will wear that.'
Fred assisted his master in putting it on,
when Mr. Fitz Henry Barton looked in the
glass and pronounced himself irresistible.
`I'm quite a handsome fellar, Frid.'
`Yes, you car' all afore you in York for dat
much, Massa Barton,' said the flattering
servant
.
`A country girl, if she was as dem pretty as
Queen Mary, should feel herself demnation
honored, I think, by my notice, eh, Frid?'
`If Mass' Barton go to England Queen
Victory
would fall chock dead in love with him,
sure'
`Think so, Frid?' asked the exquisite Mr.
Barton, in whose mind the idea seemed to
have taken a hold.
`For sartin, Mass' Barton,' said Fred,
decidedly
.
`Well, I dare say I am as good looking as
Prince Albert! I mean to go to England one
of these days, Frid. New York is too
parvenu
.
What's the clock, Frid?' he added
yawning
.
`It must be two.'
`Jiss two to a. There is the door
bell.'
`Run and show her up, Frid. Don't let
her suspect but what she is to see a lady up
stairs. `What a dem loud ring she gives'
`Mass' Barton tink Fred fool,' said the
valet, as he hastened to obey
`Now for the charming rustic,' said Mr.
Fitz Henry Barton, walking the room with an
expectant look of villainous joy; `Tucker is
prompt, dem prompt. Charming adventure
this. Oh, the exquisite dem little rural. Frid
has opened the street door.'
When Beal Tucker returned to his dwelling
he found Biddy Woodhull had made a very
comfortable dinner and was full of expressions
of gratitude both to him and his wife, for
their kindness.
`Poh, poh! I do it every daywhat's the
cost of one dinnernot five pence, certainly
not six and a quarter. I have been to see the
dress-maker and she says she should be glad
to engage you, especially when I told him, I
mean told her, what a pretty, that is, what a
nice industrious young woman you was.'
`Oh, thank you, sir,' said Biddy, thinking
she had judged Mr. Tucker uncharitably, in
suspecting him of designing any improper
liberties with her.
`Not a word. Here's your ticketbut uo
matter about it. Ask for Mrs. Fitz Henry.
She may be out when you are shown up, but
her son will be in, and you can wait for her.'
`Yes, sir.'
`Have you any handsomer dress than that
you have on?'
`Yes, sir, in my bundle.'
`Very good. Go in the next room with
Mrs. Tucker, and she'll assist you in
changing
your dress. Mr.I would say, Mrs. Fitz
Henry always likes to see persons dressed and
looking as neat as possible.'
`Yes, sir,' said Biddy, and retiring with
Beal's wife, soon re-appeared, looking
remarkably
neat, and, if possible more interesting.
Her appearance with her pretty hat, was
tasteful
and genteel.
`Yes, yes; two hundred dollars, full!' said
Beal to himself, as he looked at her, `and he
will pay it willingly. Two hundred dollars!
a good round sum to earn for one day's job!
I find the `perquisites,' he added, facetiously,
`bring me more than my regular profits. Well,
Miss Bridget, you look quite charming, now!
Don't she, Mrs. Tucker?'
You mind your own business, Beal. You
have no more to say, or do, or look, in this
matter, than just to get your money, and no
more.'
Beal looked abashed, and then from the
window called to him a little boy who
sometimes
went on errands for him. `Here, you
Jim,' he said, as the boy came up stairs, and
stood playing with his bare toes, `show this
young woman to No.  Chambers street!
Don't mistake! the number's right on the
door.'
`I can read figure's, I guess,' answered
Jim, pulling up his ragged trowsers for want
of a pin to fasten them to his dirty-colored
shirt.
`Well, see you do. Here, Miss, you can
follow that boy; he'll show you right.'
`I haven't my ticket, sir.'
`Oh, never mind the ticket. It was only
so you shouldn't forget the number of the
house. The boy'll show you that,' answered
Beal, who was too cautious to entrust her
with a paper that, very possibly, might be
produced in evidence against him. As it was,
he knew that no one could prove he had sent
her to Chambers street, or, at least, to Mr.
Fitz Henry Barton. Villany is always
sagacious
!
`Good afternoon,' said Biddy, taking up
her bundle. `I shall remember your
kindness
.'
`Good bye,' said Mrs Tucker dryly.
Beal was about to hand her down stairs,
when Bruin who had lain under a bed in the
room, suddenly bounced out in his eagerness
to follow his mistress, and running against
him nearly overthrew him.
`What in all creation is that?' screamed
Beal, catching a glimpse of the dog's tail, as
he dartcd through the door at the bottom of
the stairs, into the street.
`It's Bruin, sir,' said Biddy, laughing.
`Who's Bruin?'
`My dog, that followed me from home.
He won't leave me.'
`He must not go with you there! He
don't want a place!' said Beal, who feared
the dog might, in some way, be the means of
bringing his employer into mischief
possibly
be the means of betraying her presence
there. `Call him back!' and Beal ran to the
door and called angrily, `Dog, dog, dog!'
`His name is Bruin, sir,' said Biddy,
following
him.
`Bruin, Bruin! Here, Bruin!' repeated
Mr Tucker, soothingly; `come here, Bruin!
Poor fellar, Bruin!'
But Bruin wasn't to be coaxed, but stood in
the middle of the street, eyeing Beal with a
side-long, suspicious look, with his tail
between
his legs.
`Call him, miss. He will be killed
without
a muzzle.'
`Here, good Bruin, come to me,' said
Biddy
,
kindly.
But the dog knew better than to obey her,
well knowing there was a conspiracy against
him. Biddy advanced towards him, when
he started off on a run, and disappeared round
the first corner. She lingered, afraid he
would get lost; but Beal promising to look
after him, persuaded her to go without him.
Following the freckled-faced urchin he
had given her for a guide, Biddy soon found
herself in Broadway. What with being
bewildered
by the noise and crowd, dazzled by
the gorgeous display in the windows,
stopping
to look after brilliant ladies and dandies,
and gazing at all the odd sorts of persons she
at length arrived at Barton's door, hardly
knowing whether she had her right and
proper
senses or not.
`That's the number, young miss,' said the
boy, in a voice as hoarse as a penny-paper
crier; `I know'd the figur's soon as I seed
'm! You got a shillin', miss?'
`No, good boy,' said Biddy, embarrassed
by his abrupt demand. `But Mr Tucker
will pay you.'
`Tucker's a flummucks! Tip us a
sixpenny
then, Miss, and no blarney.'
`I haven't any money, my good boy, I'm
very sorry.'
`Sorry killed a sorrel cow! If I'd a
know'd you hadn't any shiners, I'm blow'd if
old Jew Tucker'd got me to come way here.
If you're goin' to live here, I'll keep my eye
on you, and when you get flush, I'll make
you pony up.'
With this the boy went to see what he
could get out of Beal. This little incident
added to her confusion, and she stood some
time to recover her self-possession. Besides,
it was a great event for her to `go to a
situation
,'
and she wished to appear before the
lady with composure. At length she
knocked
on the door with her knuckles. After
waiting, and hearing no one, she repeated
the knock still louder. She waited again in
vain, and began to think the people were all
away from home, when a brisk little dentist
passing on the other side of the street, seeing
her stand knocking, crossed over, and said
with a bow
`If Miss will pull the bell, she will
probably
get in,' and suiting the action to the
word, he gave the bell-knob the sharp pull
that had made Mr Fitz Henry Barton
exclaim
in surprise, `What a dem loud ring!'
`Is Mrs Fitz Henry at home, sir?' asked
Biddy, respectfully, of the smart liveried
Fred.
`
Mrs
Fitz Henry Barton? oh, yes, quite
at home, missus! Walk in! I'll show you
up stairs!
Biddy entered, and Fred was closing the
door, when Bruin bolted through, and upset
him on the broad of his back.
`Gor A'mighty, what debble animal dat?'
he cried, getting to his feet; `better kill de
nigger an' done wid it! Dis your big dog,
missus?'
`Yes,' said Biddy, laughing merrily; `I
can't keep him out. He's gone under the
stairs; will you let him stay, good man, and
I will send him off as soon as I can?'
`He stay for me; I no touch de big dog
I fear de hydifroby. Come up stairs, if
missus
please!'
Biddy suppressing the traces of laughter
from her face, followed the valet up toward
the library, from which, Mr Fitz Henry
Barton
,
wondering at the musical laugh that he
had heard, was about to come forth to
ascertain
the cause of it. On hearing them
approach
,
he retreated from the door, and
seated
himself with a book in his arm-chair.
PART V.
There be little sprites that keep true lovers in
extremity
.'
John Bertyne
.
With
a timid, hesitating step, Biddy
passed
through the door, which Frid held
respectfully
open for her, and which he
instantly
closed after her. She stood still a moment,
struck with a we and astonishment at the
magnificence
of the library and every thing she
beheld around her. To her unsophisticated,
rustic mind she seemed to be suddenly
transported
into a fairy palace. At length, half
affrighted at the splendor, she looked round
to see if she could see Mrs. Fitz Henry.
Mr.
Fitz Henry Barton was seated in his arm-chair,
wrapped in his gorgeous Chinese dressing
gown, with a velvet cap ornamented with a
gold tassel on his head; but being in the shade
of the window curtain, he seemed to form a
part of the combination of gorgeous objects
that filled and constituted the library, and her
glance did not, at the first survey, rest upon
him; his eyes, however, instead of being
fixed on the book before him, were
banqueting
on the sweet, mute loveliness that he
had so unexpectedly become the possessor of.
If Beal Tucker was struck at first sight with
her beauty, Mr. Fitz Henry Barton was
enraptured
.
Biddy advanced a step nearer.
He starts! He can scarcely believe his own
eyes. Had he seen her before? Yesit was
the pretty hay-maker in her very person. How
very beautiful she had become? What kind
fortune had sent him such a treasure! What
triumph he feels as he now thinks of his friend
Morris! He sat fixed in an attitude of
surprise
,
without the thought or power of
speaking
or moving. His senses were all resolved
into vision. So profound was his
astonishment
and delight that he could not even give
utterance to his usual exclamation, `
demnition
!'
Biddy now saw that the Chinese wrapper,
the brilliant dyes of which detained her eyes
for one instant, encased the person of a young
gentlemen, who gazed on her very earnestly
and very rapturously. She blushed, and her
timidity at the thought of soon being in the
presence of her new mistress, was changed
into beautifal confusion at seeing `her son'
instead; for, she thought instantly, at
discovering
Mr. Fitz Henry Barton, that he must be
that son of
Mrs.
Fitz Henry alluded to by the
generous Intelligence office man. With this
idea, she courtesied very modestly and
approached
him,
`If you please, sir, is Mrs. Fttz Henry at
home?'
Barton distinctly recollected her spirited
indignation at his conduct when her first met
her, and did not wish to be recognized by her,
lest all his plans should be defeated. As she
spoke, therefore, he drew his cap down over
his brows and placed on his nose a pair of gold
spectacles that had laid on the table near him.
He then looked up and said in a very
courteous
and deferential tone,
`Ah,
Mrs.
Fitz Henry! a-a-no! But she
will be in! Take a seat, Missthere upon
the ottchuman!' and rising, he offered his
hand to conduct he, to the seat.
`No, I thank you, sir,' said Biddy,
withdrawing
a step and diffidently taking the seat
he had pointed her to on the ottoman.
Mr. Fitz Henry Barton then stood still in
trie middle of the floor and looked very much
perplexed for a moment. There sat Biddy
with her bundle on her knees and her eyes
modestly cast down. He remembered her
spirit, and he felt he had to proceed with
caution
and art. He was very much gratified to
find she did not recognize him. But Mr. Fitz
Henry Barton, seen in a meadow in the
country
in his fishing costume and a broad West
India hat shading his features, and the same
gentleman in his library, wrapped in his
elegant
dressing robe, with a rich cap on his
head, looked like two very different persons,
especially to such an unpractised eye as
Biddy's
There was, however, on the nether lip
of the gentleman in the library the same
little
growth of hair that she had seen over the
mouth of the one in the country; and as
Biddy
had never seen any body with a mustache
before, except her father when his beard, as
it often was, was a week old, this sign of
manhood
on Mr. Fitz Henry Barton's lip had made
a deep and unpleasant impression upon
Biddy's
memory. Therefore, though she did not
directly identify Mr. Barton with the young
man who had attempted to kiss her, she felt
that he belonged to the same
genus
. This
reflection
made her feel uneasy, and she sat
with drooping eye-lids and a palpitating heart,
waiting for Mrs. Fitz Henry. Barton stood
looking at her with a puzzled and irresolute
countenance. He knew what kind of a spirit
he had to do with; he felt that he was more
than matched. Nevertheless his vanity led
him to believe (so long as she did not
recognize
him) that he might yet be triumphant.
His passion and unbridled desires would not
permit him to resign, without a trial, the
possession
of so much loveliness.
At length, tired waiting and feeling anxious
and intimidated by the novelty of her
situation
,
Biddy raised her eyes, and they
encountered
those of the young gentleman. She
instantly
drew her veil over her features, for her
instinctive delicacy felt itself wounded by his
hold gaze. She now began to experieace
certain
undefined yet unpleasant sensations of
she scarcely knew whatfear, suspicion, and
mistrsut, at being left alone with such an
impudent
young man, even though he might be
Mrs. Fitz Henry's son. The act of drawing
her veil over her face, his ready mind,
actively
occupied in devising some way to approach
her, seized upon as a
point d'appui
upon which
to base his attack. With a light, foppish
tread he advanced to the ottoman and said, in
a tone of gallant badinage. while he gently
lifted one corner of her veil,
`Nay, pretty one, I beg you will not draw
this curious veil over those charming features.
I have not beheld such a demnition handsome
ace this five years.'
`I prefer wearing my veil,' said Biddy,
holding it down and moving from him, and so
unintentionally leaving place for him to sit
beside her.
`Nay, nay, my sweet rustic,' he said,
seating
himself by her side and taking her hand,
which she instantly withdrew; `you are too
beautiful to withhold yourself from the eyes
of one so great an admirer of feminine charms
as I am. Pray let me put your veil aside!'
And he disengaged her hand with some degree
of force and threw the veil up over the top
of her hat. Biddy sprung from the ottoman,
and would have fled towards the door but he
caught her by the hand.
`Nay, my pretty rural, I did not mean to
offend you, 'pon honor,' he said, dropping on
his knee and feigning a look of mortification
and regret; `I thought you might indulge
me with a little flirtation.'
`I am not accustomed to such flirtations,'
said Biddy with spirit, and not knowing
whether
she ought to be angry with her mistress'
son.
`Nothing more than a mere flirtation, I
assure
you,' he said; `you are from the country,
I suppose, and don't know how they do things
in the city. All the gearls here practice
flirtation
like rehearsals before the play comes.
Do be seated!'
`No, sir, I prefer standing. Will your
mother be in soon, sir?' she asked trembling
with fear and misgiving.
`My mother? Oh, yesmy mother! yes
II have a mother!'
`So Mr. Tucker told me sira dress-maker.'
`My mother a dress-maker. Demnition!'
added the aristocratic and long descended Mr.
Fitz Henry Barton, speaking to himself; `does
she think I am a dress-maker's son? Ah! I
see into it! Beal has told her some tale to
blind her! OhYesMsis, my mother is a
yesshe isa'
`Dress-maker,' said Biddy artlessly.
`Yesyesa dress-maker!
Demnition
.'
`Will she be in soon!'
`Oh, yesyesquite soon! Do sit down.'
`I wish I could see her, sir,' said Biddy,
earnestly, only intent on her object in view;
`Mr. Tucker said he had spoken to her and
she had agreed to engage me on trial.'
`Oh, yesall right! You had best sit down
till she comes in.'
`No; I do not like to be treated rudely,'
said Biddy.
`Rudely! pretty innocent! Why, you don't
know much of life. I can kiss half the
pretty
gearls in New York; put my arm around
their waists! tell them they are demnition
angels
,
and all that sort o'thing, you know.'
`No, I do not know, sir,' answered Biddy
with spirit; `and I assure you if you think
to take such freedoms with me if I live with
your mother, I shall not allow it.
`Demnition! Not even to look at your
diamonds of eyes, my pretty rural!'
Biddy could not help smiling at the
seriousness
with which he spoke, and therefore Mr.
Fitz Henry Barton took courage and went
nearer to her. She retreated, still smiling,
yet with a resolution in her fine dark eyes
that promised to prove to him of a stranger
temper than the smile. He saw, however,
only the smile, and thinking himself invited
by it, advanced and suddenly seized her
around the waist. This act, precisely
similar
to that he had perpetrated before when
Morris rescued her, would have betrayed to
her who he was, even without the further
evidence
she instantly had before her eyes in
seeing his cap fall off and beholding him
bare-headed
,
as she had seen him in the meadow,
where his hat fell in a similar attempt.
Before he could ravish the kiss he
attempted
to take she disengaged herself and fled to
the door. It was shut by a self-acting bolt,
and could be opened only from within by a
pass-key. She made one or two convulsive
efforts to open it, when finding her escape
barred
,
she flew past Barton and darted through
a side door into his bed chamber. On seeing
the nature of the place in which she had
sought shelter she would have retreated when
she discovered a door on the farther side, for
which she sprung. She flung it open with a
glad cry and found herself in a bath room.
We will now return to Edward Morris who,
it will be remembered, went to Charleston a
day or two after his apple-tree trysting with
lovely hay-maker, whose beauty, innocence,
and naturalness had then well nigh drawn him
into a declaration of love. The arguments
he made use of to protect his heart from being
further involved being based upon their
different
conditions in life will also be
remembered
.
It was, therefore, with the
determination
to forget the rustic beauty whose
loveliness
had so seriously impressed his heart that
he accompanied his aunt on her southern
excursion
.
But absence did not conquer love!
He found his thoughts constantly reverting to
the meadow and the old apple tree, where he
had spent such a blissful hour with the
pretty
hay-maker. He was strangely absent and
thoughtful amid all the gayeties of that
refined
city, and insensible to the fascinations of
the lovely and gay girls who sought his
admiration
.
Often he was rallied on having his
heart in New York, and he could not but
confess
to himself that he had left it in West
Chester. He found himself penning sonnets
to rural maidens, and writing verses on rural
life. Love grows with what it feeds upon;
and his scarcely confirmed love for the pretty
hay-maker having his thoughts for food,
thrived
amazingly. At length he began to look
forward with impatience for his aunt's return,
and seeing his anxiety to hasten back she
shortened the period of her stay and prepared
to leave. A letter which he received the day
he was to sail, in some degree relieved certain
misgivings he had for some time felt of his
pretty hay-maker's safety. It did not,
however
,
cause him to delay his departure for
home any longer. The letter was as follows:
`
New York
,
July
, 1838.
Dear Ned
:
What a demnition time you are staying out
South. What you can find to keep you there
this dem hot weather one hour after your
aunt's business is done for, unless some
pretty
pearl, I'm dem'd if I can tell! Every thing
goes on just as ever. I had a glorious drive
last Friday on the avenue with Bob-tailed
Brown, harnessed single in my green buggy.
Tom Weston had a new team out, a dem'd
handsome thing altogether, and came behind
me like a streak of lightning. But I touched
Bob and left Tom half a mile in the rear as I
drew rein at the Harlem tavern. Dem'd good
that, wasn't it! I run over a sow and a litter
of nine pigs. Did'nt the young 'uns
scamper
a few. I took off a goose's neck with my
off wheel as neat as you could cut it with a
knife. Tom swore Bob was the best bit o'
horse flesh in New York. Saw a pretty gearl
on the side-walklooked like a ruralbut I
was too anxious to beat Tom Weston's mare
to stop and ask her where she lived.
Sunday
went over to Hoboken and saw lots o'
second quality class beauties, but couldn't do
any thing in my way, as they always have
some of those chaps with a bob coat, round
slick hat with a narrow crape round it, their
hair plaited down on each cheek, aad their
bosoms open, and cuffs and shirt-wristbands
turned back as if they were ready at any
moment
for a fight. I can't endure such vulgar
people! though I don't mind a set-to, for I
have the true science you know, Ned. Havn't
been out of town yet, but I believe I shall go
to Saratoga next month. Saratogo is getting
to be low now that every shop-keeper that
can command three dollars can go there.
These steamboats and railroads are getting to
be great levellers, Ned. I think I must go
to the White Sulphurs, they are the most
exclusive
.
Low people can't afford to get there
I saw your uncle last week in Broadway. He
would have passed me without seeing me, but
I stopped to ask him the name of the farmer
on the farm next to his above on the creek
where the rural lives. He told me it was
Woodhull. If you don't come on soon I
shall go down there and get up a little
flirtation
with her. I think she's too pretty to be
suffered to grow there unnoticed like a sweet
flower under a hedge. Well, I have no more
to write. By the by, my friend Mks has
let his beard grow all over his chin and it
looks dem'd fine. I think I shall follow his
example. He is going to be confirmed at St.
Thomas'. Religion is a nice thing for sick
and old people, but it spoils life for your true
blood!
In haste yours,
Fitz Henry Barton
.
P. S. Tom Weston's mare stumbled this
afternoon and pitched Tom out on his head
and killed him. How dem'd unlucky, for I
meant to have another race with Tom, for a
basket of `Star Brand.' The mare wasn't
hurt! wasn't that demnition lucky? F. B.'
The steamer Neptune in which Edward
Morris and his aunt came passengers, landed
at the pier at four o'clock the afternoon
previous
to Biddy's elopement. His aunt's
carriage
was in waiting, and putting her into it
he let her proceed to her home in Bleecker
street alone, while he took a hack to his
stables
where he kept his horses, that he might
at once drive to his father's country seat.
Was this haste and anxiety to leave the city
without seeing any of his friends owing to
filial love? He had been absent from home
two months, to be sure; but young
gentlemen
of Morris' age and experience are not
apt to hurry back to the paternal roof with
precisely such solicitude as he now evinced.
There was a stronger and more tender
attraction
than his father that drew him!
`Quick! my horses, Jim!' he cried,
jumping
from the hackney coach as it drew up at
the stables in Crosby street.
`Ah, your honor, and you're come back is
it ye ar,' said Jim, the ostler, with a broad
grin of welcome; `as' its the pretty bastes
ye ll find in good ordther. They have been
four weeks to grass and came in yesterday
as your honor writ to boss, and by the same
token I seed the lether.'
`Well, well, hurry, Jim,' interrupted
Morris
;
`I dare say that, an' twice over again,
an' it'll be no lie at all at all,' said Jim, going
to the stalls. `Is it one or the pair your
honor
'll have?'
`The pair. Put them in at once!'
`It shall be done right to the fore, yer
honor
.
Och? wont the darlints feel their
kapeing
!
They'll kick the miles behind 'em like
paving stones!'
Morris smiled at Jim's encomiums upon his
horses, and in a few minutes afterwards was
seated in his buggy with the fawn colored
lines in his hands. Jim now gave the last
gentle rubbing down with the palm of his
hand to the beautiful neck of the right horse,
and stepping a pace aside from the line of the
wheels, pronounced `all right.'
Edward Morris did not wait for a second
notice, but drawing lightly on the reins so
that the horses could just feel the pressure,
he spoke a word to them and they started off
at a rapid and dashing pace. Turning down
Bleecker street into the Bowery he soon
crossed
upon the avenue when he gave them rein.
`Come, my noble fellows,' he said as they
flew along the smooth course, `you must
make up this afternoon for your long idleness.
Trot! you know the road, I see, and are as
glad as I am to be on it once more.'
Away they flew with their impatient
master
;
and just as the sun was setting, two and
a half hours after leaving his stable, Edward
drew rein at the gate of the avenue that led to
his father's house. His own footman, who
had seen him descending a hill a mile distant
on the high-way, threw open the gate, and
the next instant he alighted from his buggy
at the door of his paternal home.
`My son!' exclaimed the old gentleman,
hastening to meet him and glancing
inquiringly
at the reeking horses, `welcome, indeed!
but what has happened? Your aunt, I hope
`All well, father. Aunt is at home in
Bleecker street.'
`Well, I am glad to see you, my dear boy.
You look finelybut how the devil you do
drive!' And the old merchant looked again
at the steeds whose breasts and nostrils were
white with foam, and shook his head.
`They have not been driven for some time,
sir,' said Edward, smiling at the secret cause
of his haste, which his father could not divine
and which indeed he would not frankly
acknowledge
to himself.
`Perhaps soperhaps so. John walk them
about in their harness half an hour, and when
you strip them rub them 'till they are dry,
and then blanket them closely. If they catch
cold Edward will lose them. Come in, my
boy, and tell us all about Charleston.'
Edward followed his kind father in, but ere
he did so he glanced unconsciously in the
direction
of the Woodhull farm, and beckoned
John to him.
`John, has anything happened about here
since I have been absent?'
`Happenedno, sir.'
`Anybody deadthat is, anybody
married
?
'
`No, sir, I believe not.'
`No news then, John? How do the
farmers
about us get along?'
`'Bont as usual, sir.'
`Farmer Woodhull still lives up the
meadow
?'
`Yes, sir.'
`Sure there is no news, John.'
`Yes, sir, quite sure. If there was I'd
know it, as I've been here with the old
gentleman
almost ever since you left.'
`Very well John. See that the horses are
carefully groomed.'
`Yes, sir,' said John, touching his hat as his
master entered the house.
Edward lingered over the tea table with as
much patience as his impatience to get away
would permit him to exercise. He related
all that could interest his father in reference
to his southern tour, and replied to the
numerous
questions he put to him without any
outward signs of annoyance.
At length, when the clock struck nine he
managed to excuse himself with the plea of
looking after his horses, a plea which the old
gentleman very readily admitted. Edward,
however, merely glanced into the stable and
asked John how they were, and then
continued
past it to a narrow gate which led into a
lane. It was a clear, starlight night, and,
familiar
with the road, he walked rapidly
through the lane until be came to its
extremity
near the creek. Here he struck into a
path beside the water, and following it for
some time, at length came to the very place
in the hedge over which he had sprung after
Barton, on first seeing Biddy in the meadow.
He again climbed over it and instinctively
hastened onward until he reached the old
apple-tree
where he had parted from her. Here
he stopped and took off his hat with a sort
of tender reverence.
`Yes, this is the well remembered spot!
Here is the old root on which we sat, side by
side, her hand in mine! How often have my
thoughts wandered back to this tree! How
often have I lived over again in memory the
happy hour I passed here with hergentle,
guileless, and so fair! Ah, me! I am in love
and need no longer try to disguise it! My
presence on this spot at this hour should be
proof enough of it to my own mind. It is
either evidence of love or of madness! I have
ill kept my resolution not to see her again.
Yet here I am, and I am confident I shall not
go back `till I have an interview with her, if
not too late at night! Perhaps she may care
nothing for meperhaps may have forgotten
me! But my heart tells me differently. I
could not think so much and tenderly of one
wholly indifferent to me herself. What if she
should have a rustic lover! I will go towards
the farm house and see how things appear: I
may possibly get a glimpse of herperhaps
have an opportunity of speaking to her.'
With these lover like thoughts Edward
crossed the meadow, and at length reached
the yard enclosing the house. He
noiselessty
crossed the bars and entered a little path
that led through a grove to the door. He
passed out from the covert of the trees, and
the humble house stood plain before him. All
was dark!
`They have gone to bed,' said he after
surveying
the unilluminated mansion; `I might
have known if I had thought a moment of
the habits of farmers. I wonder which is
her room! Perhaps this low one with the
rose-tree beside itperhaps that in the attic.
Whichever it be, heaven bless her, and
angels
watch over her innocenc eand beauty!'
How happy Biddy would have been in her
little attic could she have known, while its
prisoner, that such a prayer, from such a
heart, was breathed so near for her. How
her heart would have bounded to know that
she had one devoted lover, and he the youth
whose image had occupied so much of her
thoughts since she first beheld him, and which
always formed a component of all her dreams
of coming happiness! Little would she have
thought of flying from home in the morning
if she had known the handsome young
fisherman
was hovering around it.
Edward gazed a long while at the house,
walked all around it, and dwelt in imagina
tion upon the loveliness of her who might be
sleeping within its walls.
`Yes,' he at length said fervently, `I will
see her to-morrow, and if she is still worthy
and will marry me, I'll make her my wife.'
He turned to leave the spot, when Bruin,
now first conscious of the presence of an
intruder
,
sprung towards him with an angry
growl. He started back and then spoke to
him in a low but in an authoritative and
fearless
tone. The dog's menacing approach was
instantly exchanged for one more friendly,
and coming slowly up to him he scented round
his feet and then stood still beside him.
`Noble fellow,' said Morris, who had
checked
his fierceness by speaking to him in the
tone in which he was accustomed to address
his own dogs; `doubtless if you had speech
you would relieve many a doubt for me.
Now, good night, sweet maiden!' he said,
looking towards the house: `to-morrow I will
see thee and thou shalt decide my destiny, for
thou alone hast it in thy keeping.'
With these words he turned and walked
away towards home. Bruin trotted gravely
at his side, as if to escort and see him quite
off the premises. At the bars the sagacious
dog stopped and watched him 'till he got
quite out of sight across the meadow, and
then turned and walked slowly back to the
house, wondering, no doubt, what that
stranger
could have wanted about the farm house
at that time of night. About four or five
hours afterwards he saw Biddy herself appear
with her bundle, when doubtless, his sober
wonder was very much increased. His
affection
for her, however, led him to follow
her away without making any remark about
thesingularity of the circumstance.
Edward safely reached home, and went to
bed to dream of apple-trees and
haymaking-girls
in old straw hats. After breakfast the
next morning, he sauntered along the creek
and across the meadow, hoping he might fall
in with Biddy. Although as our caption has
it, `there be little sprites to aid lovers in
extremity
,'
none came to Edward's in the shape
of Biddy, and he finally came very near the
farm-house without seeing any one. There
seemed to be a good deal of bustle there, and
two or three neighbors were outside the door
talking loudly and earnestly with Mrs
Woodhull
and her two daughters, who stood in it.
Approaching nearer with curiosity, he heard
one of the woman say, `Sarved you just
right, Mrs Woodhull! The way you've
treated
her has been a public shame to the
neighborhood
.'
`Yes, indeed, it has,' echoed another one.
`She was a lazy trollope, and as sassing as
a lady,' said Mrs. Woodhull, lifting her voice
in defence of herself.
`She had city beaux, and thought herself
above common folks,' said Miss Euphrosia
`Yes, and I shouldn't wonder if she'd run
off with one on 'em, jiss for your treatin' her
so onnatural,' said the first speaker. `Biddy
was a good gal, and every body liked her.'
`Yes,' said another neighbor, `and for my
part, I hopes, Mrs. Woodhull, she'll stay
away 'till you can learn to act like a human
mother towards her.'
`She'll bring shame and disgrace on the
family,' said Miss Euphrosia, weeping.
`Your treatment to her has brought shame
and disgrace on it already, miss,' said one of
the neighbors, sharply. `Come, folks, let's
go home, and not trouble ourselves no more
about the matter! I'm glad she's gone! You
may go to the other neighbors and hunt, as
well as to our houses, but I reckon she's
better
looked out for herself than to let you lock
her up again very soon, as David Woodhull
says you did, all day yesterday, on bread and
water.'
`It's a lie,' shrieked Mrs. Woodhull after
them, as they turned away.
`Yes, father lies,' said the gentle Miss
Euphrosia
;
`we didn't lock her up; and Biddy
lies if she dare tell any body so?'
`What seems to be the difficulty, good
women
,'
said Edward, as the neighbors whose
Sally's account of Biddy's flight, on going in
search of her, had brought over to Mrs.
Woodhull's house, were passing the place
where he stood by the gate.
`Why, it's Mrs. Woodhull, our neighbor,
here, sir,' answered one of the most forward,
`who has always treated her daughter, Biddy,
a nice, pretty, and good girl as ever was, jist
like a slave! And, yesterday, because
somebody
said how they saw, two months ago, a
city young gentleman sit and talk with her
under the old apple-tree in the meadow, when
old David was asleep beneath it, what must
she do but lock her up on bread and water.'
`The infernal hag,' exclaimed Edward,
with indignation.
`I'm sorry to hear you swear, sir, but it is a
pity to think how the poor thing has been
treated by her mother and sisters! and jist
because Biddy was so sweet and good natured
and prettyand they knew themselves to be
so cross, sour and ugly.'
`But what became of her good woman?'
inquired Edward, with solicitous interest.
`Well, you see, her mother locked her up
in the attic there, yesterday morning, and
made her work all day like a niggar, and fed
her on bread and water; and she said she
should be locked up so a week, `till she told
who her handsome city bean was. Miss Sally
confessed this much to me, just now.'
`Did she tell?' asked Edward, coloring.
`No, she wouldn't nor couldn't, nor I
wouldn't if I could, if I'd been in Biddy's
place,' said another of the women.
`And is she there now, locked up?' asked
Edward, making a step towards the house.
`Lor' bless your soul, sir, no! That's what
the fuss is all about. She took the hinges off
the door as nice as you ever seen a smith do it,
and'so comin' down stairs, got off this morning
afore day!'
`Where is she now?' he asked, with
breathless
interest.
`Dear knows, sir! Her mother, shame to
her, has been sending to the neighbors about
for her, but I'm thinking she's gone down to
York in the early stage. She know'd she
could get places enough there, and good
treatment
at that, if 'twas among strangers. They
say old Bruin is missing too.'
`And this is all that is known, good woman;'
asked he, anxiously.
`Yes, and all I hope her mother and Miss
`Phrosy'll ever know about her, 'till they
repents
their treatment on her. You seem to
take it to heart, young man?'
`No,no! I feel indignation at tyranny in any
shape, particularly when the victim is the
child of the tyrant, and, as you say young
and virtuous. What time does the stage pass
by on the road, mornings?'
`Why, about five o'clock, or little earlier,'
answered the woman, deliberating, after
thinking a moment.
`I thank you for your kindness, good
woman
;
if you learn any thing from the young
womanMiss BiddyI would be obliged to
you to send word to Woodburn.'
With these words, Edward hastened away,
and rapidly took the path by the creek,
towards
his father's seat.
`Woodburn!' repeated one of the women.
`Why, that's Mr. Morris' place. I wonder
if that can be his son that's been in Europe?'
`I shouldn't wonder if he was,' answered
the other two in the same breath.
`What an interest he took in Biddy.'
`Didn't he?' repeated the others.
`I shouldn't wonder if he was the
New-York
beau Miss 'Phrosy talks about?'
`I shouldn't wonder,' echoed the others;
`he is a nice young man, but too high for
Biddy to look up to in a honest way.'
`I have known stranger things happen,
though, in my day,' said one of the women.
`So have I. There's no knowin' what
may turn up, as I always says to my old man,
Joshua.'
`No, there's no knowin',' repeated the
other two; and the three went on their way
home, wondering at, and speculating upon the
events of the morning.
The intelligence Edward Morris had
received
,
gave impulse and energy to his active
spirit. Biddy had flown from persecution,
and he had heard her innocence and worth
borne witness to by those who had told him
of her paternal bondage and of her flight.
`How fortunate I arrived from Charleston
as I did. How unfortunate I had not gone
over earlier last evening?' he said to himself;
`I would have rescued her with my life? She
has fled, no one knows whither? It is now
nine o'clock, and the stage has gone by four
hours If she took it, she is in the city by
this time. A stranger there, and so young
and helpless! I pray that silly fellow, Barton,
may not see and recognize her! Ah! may he
not have had something to do with her flight!
But no, that cannot be! She has escaped
because
she was imprisoned by her mother, and
without motive or end. I heard something
said about her getting some situation in town.
Perhaps her necessity may compel her to
accept
of degrading serviceperhaps toobut I
will not talkI will act! She must be found
if she be living.'
He was hastening along the path by the
deep still water, when he spoke this, and he
shuddered with the idea as he looked upon
the dark flood, that she might possibly have
thrown herself into it. But he could not
harbor
the thought of such a fearful voluntary
end to youth and beauty like her's, and
banishing
it from his mind, he hastened onward
until he reached his house. John was at the
stables attending to his horses. He
immediately
called to him, and bade him put them at
once to the buggy, and prepare to drive him
to town. He entered the house to explain to
his father the necessity there was of his
suddenly
returning to New-York, and that he
might not be back that night. In a few
minutes the horses were at the door, and John
in his place, with the lines in his hands.
Morris
sprung in, and they set off at a pace that
carried him soon out of hearing of the old
gentleman's reiterated admonition, not to
`drive too fast.'
Once on the highway, Edward let the
horses move at a rapid travelling trot, and in
half an hour reached the village of Fordham.
Drawing up suddenly at the little inn, he
inquired
,
without alighting, what time the
Chester
stage had passed along.
`About half pasth sax, yer honor,' said the
ostler, spunging the horses' noses with a large
spunge dipped in cool pump water.
`Were there many passengers?'
`Four, yer honor.'
`Was one of them a young person'
`Yes, yer, honor,' said Pat, washing a
nostril
,
`a young gosson of a lad, wid his hat o'er
his eyes, and he asleep at dat.'
`No, no, a young woman.'
`Och, now, and it's thrue for you! there
was a young woman inside, an ould man!'
`Confound the old man!'
`Ay, and divil take him, too, if your
honor
says the word,' said Pat, with a hearty will.
`What kind of a looking person was the
young woman?' asked Morris, impatiently.
`Och, wasn't she the darlin! She axed me
with the swatest musical voice in the world,
if I would'nt be so obleging as to be afther
givin her a glass o'wather! An' whin I axed
her if she would'nt prefar the drop o'whiskey
in praferance, she smiled out of her two
diamond
black eyes, and spake from out her
red lips to me, as if I'd been a gintleman, and
she the Quane o' Ireland. `No, I thank you,
sir,' and so, yer honor, I gave her the water,
though I did'nt like to give the naked wather
to such a nice jewel of a lady at all, at all!
It's the illigant bastes yer honor's honor
drives!'
Edward, despairing of getting more
accurate
information from the ostler, threw him
half a dollar and, dashed forward at full speed.
Though not wholly convinced, from Pat's
relation
,
that he was on the track of the
fugitive
,
yet his hopes whispered to him that this
person he described might be her; and with
this idea, which grew stronger each moment,
till it approached nearly to conviction in his
own mind, he pursued his rapid way, on the
road towards Harlem.
PART VI.
Morris
' blooded bays dashed along the
turnpike towards Harlem, at a rate that soon
brought him to the stage-inn door. The red
headed Scotch estler, leaving a horse that he
was rubbing down, sprung to their heads,
while all the loafers that usually lounged in
the bar and about the door, crowded up
t
o see
what had occasioned such a hurried arrival,
and to gaze at the foaming animals.
`Wull I gie them a cule sponging, sir?'
asked
Jamie; `it's a warm day for sic fat
cattle
to be on the road.'
`No, no! I shall not stop,' said Edward with
impatience, and looking angrily around upon
the crowd of loaters who stood staring at him
and his horses. `Were you here when the
Chester stage came in, ostler?' he asked him
in an under tone, `and did you notice a
pretty
young woman in it?'
`I dinna aften tak notice o' bonny lassesi'
stage coaches, gude frien,' said Jamie,
affecting
an indifferent tone. `What, now, would
ye be willin' to gi'e a body for the
information
?'
Morris could not help smiling at the
Scotchman's
shrewdness, and handed him a quarter
of dollar. Jamie took `the siller' in his
bonny
palm, tried it between his teeth, inspected
closely the stamp, and then, as if satisfied of
its currency, deliberately took from his pocket
the thumb of an old leather glove, and added
it to a small store of coin which it contained.
Then returning his treasure to the receptacle
from which he had drawn it forth, he looked
shrewdly yet coolly up into Edward's face,
and said in his characteristic dry tone
`Sae, its a bonny lass yer'e speerin after,
maister?'
`Yes! did you notice one in the stage?'
`Perhaps I did. Had she black een!'
`Yes, very dark black eyes!'
`Was she aboot saxteen or thereaway?'
interrogated
the deliberate Jamie.
`Yes I want to know if she continued on
with the stage, or got out here.'
`Had the lassie a wee bundle wi' her?'
`YesI dare sayyes;' at length replied
Edward, with an impatience to which the
philosophical
Jamie was quite insensible.
`Well, then, I believe that I did see the
lass, mon! I mind her bonny black een, weel.
She woulkn't alight, but sat quiet i' the coach
`till Deck the coachmon changed the cattle.
I mind her weel, man.'
`Then she kept on to the city?' said
Morris
,
making a sign to John to start forward.
`As to hersel' keeyin' on to the ceety, I
wunna just answer to aver to ye,' replied
Jamie
,
stepping aside from the horses' heads, as
he saw John was about to move, `but she left
the inn, inside the coach, and doubtless kept
her seat 'till she got to the toon.'
Edward was twenty feet off as the last
words reached his ears, and moving at the rate
of twelve miles an hour towards town.
Whoever
has had the happiness to drive a pair of
fast trotting horses on that delightful pleasure
course, the Third Avenue, will easily form an
idea of the fleetness with which our hero,
having an object so important in view, was
whirling over it towards the city. If his
horses did not fling the miles behind them
`like paving-stones, as his Irish ostler
promised
they would, they seemed to fly over them
with winged hoofs! At length they
approached
the great city with its hundred graceful
spires, towers and gothic turrets, and soon
afterwards
turned from the avenue into that
great artery of the city, the thronged and
noisy Bowery. It now, for the first time,
occurred
to Morris that he had, in his impatience
to proceed, neglected to inquire at Harlem,
where the West Chester stage put up. This
he now felt was very important for him to
know, and from that point his search for the
lovely runaway was to commence.
`John,' he said abruptly, as his servant
guided the horses along the intricated and
devious
passages formed by the numerous
vehicles
moving in every direction.
`Sir,' answered John, touching his hat with
his whip hand.
`Stop at the first stage office where I can
inquire where the West Chester stage puts
out its passengers.'
`Oh, I can tell you that, sir,' said John,
who, until they reached Fordham, had
wondered
what had caused his master to start so
suddenly for town; and who, since he had
learned his object by his inquiries, had been
puzzled to learn why the moral and staid young
Edward Morris should be thus openly
engaged
in pursuit of a young girl `with a bundle.'
Morris, however, had not seen fit to make
John his confidant, and so the valet continued
in his mystification, though with a very
natural
curiosity to know in what his
extraordinary
pursuit was likely to terminate. `It's
No. 21, Bowery, sir,' added John.
`Then drive thither without delay,' said
Morris, his mind very much relieved.
What with the detentions caused by
omnibusses
and rail-cars, it seemed a long time to
the impatient young lover before John at
length drew up before a low, straw-colored
wooden building, just below the theatre on the
east side of the way, with `No. 21, Bowery,'
painted in large letters on the front. An
awning
stretched over the sidewalk, and beneath
it, round a door leading into a bar-room, sat
several loungers and loafers, and idle
stage-drivers
.
Edward's dashing equipage and fine
horses instantly drew the attention of two or
three of the latter, and they got up to look at
it with professional admiration and curiosity.
Without heeding them, Edward sprang out,
and entered the low bar-room which was also
used as a stage-office. Two or three women
and an old farmer were seated there, waiting
for stages. He glanced round upon them as
he entered, as if he expected to see there the
object of his pursuit; while instantly his
thoughts revolted at the idea of finding her in
such a place. A stout man, with a `mine
host' like look, was writing on a scrap of
paper
at a little desk behind the bar.
`Does the stage from West Chester County
stop here, sir?' he asked of this functionary.
The man neither lifted his eyes nor his pen,
and replied mechanically, `Yes.'
`Can you tell me, sir,' continued Edward,
whose own ardor of feeling was chilled by
this indifference to his solicitous inquiry, and
he spoke now with a respectful deference, that
he thought would draw a more civil reply
from the absorbed agent or landlord. The
man's ear was not insensible to the
gentlemanly
tone of his voice, and looked up, and
seeing Morris, laid down his pen, and said with
an apologetic smile
`Beg, pardon, sir, what did you wish!'
`Can you tell me if a young personthat
is, a young lady, came in the Chester stage
this morning?'
`Well, I cant, as I was to breakfast when
Dick Sharwood got in; but I can see Dick,
and let you know, sir.'
`I'm sorry to put you to any trouble, sir.'
`Oh, none at all, sir! Dick's just at the
door. Ho, there, boys, is Chester Dick there.'
he hallooed to those on the side-walk, looking
at, and commenting upon Edward's horses.
`What's that, Mister Corney?' officiously
asked a ragged fellow with a watery eye, a
round rubicund face, and one of those
good-natured
smiles one often sees on the features
of those wrecked whole-soul'd fellows, who
have been ruined by such `devilish good
hearted
chaps.' It was Tom Conklin, who had a
heart like a baby, and would drink with any
body that would kindly ask him. Tom had a
sort of tenancy for life, of the bar-room by
day, and a bed in the stable at night, through
the summer months; but in winter, he sought
the shelter of the almshouse. Tom was
always
about the door, and always contrived,
when any one came in to drink, to say a civil
word to him, tell him that `his pocket
ha'kerchief
was out, and the boys might pick it,' or
that he might lose `that paper in his
waist-coat
pocket;' or he would see, or pretend to
see a little flour or dust on the comer-in's coat
behind, and offering to brush it off. So, as
men who go to bars to drink, always prefer
drinking with somebody than drinking alone;
poor Tom Conklin got many an invitation
between
sunrise and sunset. Thus Tom got
along with the drinking part of his living;
and by keeping on good terms with the cooks
of one or two taverns near by, he got a plate
now and then, of cold meat and bread. Tom,
however, was always obliging, and ready to
do any service for any body that needed it!
bring a pitcher of water for the bar, clean the
`agents' boots; get the milk from the yelling
milkman, and bring it to the maid in the door,
and other such little matters. Sometimes he
would hold a horse, or do some other service
for a gentleman, and get money instead of
rum. But Tom was one of those `whole
souls,' and he bad a great deal rather have
had a drink with, and from the one he served,
than the money; for he loved social feeling,
to which, alas, for poor Tom, he had become
the pitiable victim! Tom had twenty
thousand
dollars left him at twenty-one, and what
with his `social feelings' and dissipated
associates
,
he had not a dollar left at twenty-five.
So he became the poor creature that he now
was. Poor Tom! poor devil! equally to be
despised and pitied, would that thou wert alone
in thy sad and degraded estate.
`Vot's vanted, Mister Corney?' asked Tom,
who, on seeing Edward enter the office, had
followed him. `Can I do any thing for you,
sir?' he added, touching his ragged beaver,
and smiling insinuatingly.
Edward glanced at him with an emotion of
pain and commisseration, as he replied, `No,
poor fellow.'
`I
am
a poor fellow, that's a pos', mister,'
said Tom, with his best-humored smile, `a
dn poor fellow. S'p'ose we take a drink,
coz I likes your looks. I knows vot a
gent'leman
is, havin' been one myself, you see; but
it's a dn loafer I've got to be now. But
happy go lucky! Vot'll you drink, master?
`I never take any thing quite so early,' said
Edward, with a smile of pity.
`I don't keep no watch, now, and liquor is
liquor at all sorts o'clock. I likes it vedever
I can get it. Come, let's take a little som'at
for old acquaintance.'
`I don't recollect that I ever saw you
before
,'
said Morris, staring.
`That's nothin' here nor there. God put
us all into this world strangers to one another,
for us all to make each other's acquaintance.
Come, Mr. Corney, hand down the `canter.'
`Don't pester the gentleman, Tom. You
know you can't pay if he would condescend
to drink.'
`Pay! Think I'd drink with a gen'leman
and he'd let me pay?' The Gen'leman will
not let me pay if I axes him to drink.'
`Is Dick Sherwook out there, Tom?' asked
the agent.
`No, he's jiss gone home.'
`Did you see the stage stop here?'
`Yes. But now, Corney, if you want to
pump me,' said Tom, humorously, `put some
liquor into me first, or I'm dd if the pump
won't suck.'
The bar-keeper laughingly poured him out
a dram, which Tom took off after nodding
and touching his hat to Morris, who, from a
fixed principle which it is to be regretted did
not more generally influence gentlemen in
such cases, resolved not to pay for any thing
for him to drink. Doubtless Tom thought
him only half-souled, and the bar-keeper,
avaricious
,
if not mean.
`Well, that's good liquor. Yes, I seed
Dick when he druv up to the curb-stone.'
`Did all the passengers get out here?'
asked
Edward, eagerly.
Tom squinted at him out of one corner of
his eye as much as to say, `No go, young un.
You don't come the catechism over Tom
Conklin.' Edward very quickly understood
him, and placed a
douceur
in his hand, that
produced a magic effect upon Tom's aspect.
`That's the right tongue-oil, master!' said
Tom, sticking it in his mouth for want of a
sound pocket:
`Now fire away.'
`Was there a young lady got out here!'
`I seed a young vooman as vould ha' been
a lady if as how she hadn't a bundle,' said
Tom.
`That is the one. Where did she go?'
`I seed Dick tell a niggar to take her
bundle
,
and show her some place she wanted to
find.'
`Did you learn what place:'
`No, but I guess Dick could tell.'
`And she went with the negro?'
`Not cozactly with him, coz he went ahead
and she behind,' replied Tom, with a gravity
that made Morris smile notwithstanding his
anxiety to discover his pretty hay-maker.
`What direction did she take?'
`Down Bowery.'
`Where is this driver to be found sir,'
inquired
Edward of the bar-keeper.
`At his house, I expect, but I don't know
where it is.'
`I knows, sir,' said Tom, `if the gentleman
'll follow me. It's number five, Bayard St.
a ricketty wooden house, with the up-stairs
all tumbling down stairs, that would a been
burned up long ago, if the fire had not been
ashamed to be seen burnin' sich a hedifice.'
`Thank you,' said Edward, leaving the bar
room; and hastily crossing the side-walk, he
sprung into his buggy, and bade John drive
down to Bayard Street, which was the next
corner.
`There goes a rum un,' said one of the
stage-drivers! `he thinks horseflesh is made
o'ingy rubber and whalebone. I never see
horses druv that devil-behind-catch-me way!
It makes me mad to see good animals abused
so, jist for a fellow with a strait coat and kid
gloves!'
`He's got som'at to drive for,' said Tom,
making his appearance. `He's after a young
vooman as is run avay, I reckon, and come to
town in Dick's coach.'
`I saw the girl, and a fine pretty one she
was, too,' said another of the men; `and she
was poor, too, I guess, for Dick gave a niggar
a sixpence for showing her some place she
was after.'
`Them horses is worth all the young
women
in York,' said the first stage-driver; `I
wouldn't drive 'em so for any on 'em, I'll be
blest!'
`Not even for Jane Bailey, Barney,' said
Tom, winking round.
Barney's red face looked more crimson still
and he levelled a blow of his whip at Tom's
head amid the laughter of his companions.
But Tom dodged it from long practice, and it
descended obliquely, with all its force, upon
the shins of the rascally negro who had
guided
Biddy to the Intelligence office. He set
up a yell of pain and danced round on the
side-walk, for a few seconds, as if he had
stepped
in boiling water.
`Keep it up, darkey! that's y'er sort! jump
Jim Crow,' cried Tom, with delight, as much
at his own escape as at the other's suffering
and antics. `When you get tired, nig, come
in and take a drink! Dn me if I'm ashamed
to drink with a niggar who's prove so good a
friend, if he is black! I'm no abolitionist
though! Come along, Cuffee! I've got the
brass! Here, Corney, go in and give us a
dram? Hullo, boys, come along! I've got a
quarter, and so let's have a treat all round!
Hang the expense! What's money for, if it
a'nt to spend. Come, boys, step up, and let
Tom Conklin treat?'
Scarcely one present declined the
invitation
to drink, and so Morris' generosity
contributed
to the inebriation of half a dozen,
instead
of one, as would have been its limit,
had he paid for a drink for Tom, which he
would have been as well satisfied with as with
the quarter. But this does not affect the
principle by which he was governed. In one
instance, though the evil would have been
less, he would have been morally culpable:
in the other, though the evil was greater, he
was blameless! Uprightness and integrity of
principle and action, are always safest; the
effects must be left to themselves.
Passengers in the street, and neighbors from
the opposite window, gazed with surprise and
curiosity to see a handsome equipage, with a
man in livery, draw up in Bayard Street,
before
No. 5, and a fashionable young
gentleman
alight, and survey, with some hesitation,
the premises, previous to entering them.
Tom's description of the old wooded cluster
of houses was not exaggerated; and those
who have seen them, will not think it
surprizing
Edward should pause. They were an
old wooden row, black, and out of repair, with
broken steps and windows, and inhabited,
seemingly, by a dozen tenants. At No. 5,
which was about the midst of the buildings,
was a sort of stoop, over which hung a dirty
sign, with a boot painted on it.
`Is this the house of Mr. Sherwood, the
stage-driver?' asked Edward of a woman,
sitting with a child on her lap, in one of two
doors which seemed equally to lay claim to
No. 5.
`No, yer honor,' she screamed; `it's
number
fave he lives, the nix' door up stair! Go
right up them little steps on the stoop, yer
honor, and thin ye'll see the stair right afore
ye! Is't washin' doon ye want?'
`No,' said Edward, and turned to obey her
direction; but the stairs before him were so
one-sided, that he hesitated to ascend them,
and he knocked on the wainscot with his
knuckles. A little girl, cleanly and neatly
dressed, came to the head of the stairs, and
he asked her if Mr. Sherwood lived there.
`Yes, sir. Papa,' she called, `here's somebody
come to see you.'
`Ask him to come up,' answered the voice
of honest Dick, as if his mouth was full of his
breakfast; `tell 'em to mind and not break
their necks on the stairs!'
Edward thought the caution was very
necessary, and carefully ascended to the
landing, when, through an open door, he saw
the stage-driver seated at his breakfast. He
stopped in doubt, whether to advance or not,
when Dick, turning round, and seeing him,
instantly got up from the table, while his wife
bustled about for a chair.
`Oh, sir, I beg pardon; I thought it some
of the boys from 21. Walk in, sir. It's a
poor place for a gentleman to come intobut
it's the best I can afford these hard times, sir.
These railroads and steamboats destroy the
poor coachman, sir! Please to sit down.
Wife, dust the chair for the gentleman!'
Edward entered the room, which was neat,
and better furnished than the outward
appearance
of the house promised, and took a
chair, which the tidy Mrs. Sherwood wiped
out for him with her check apron.
`I fear I am an intruder,' said Morris, `but
I called to ask about a young woman, who
came down from the country in the stage this
morning.'
Oh, yes! Wife and I was just this minute
talking about her! Didn't I tell you, wife,
how I thought after she left the stage, she was
a respectable young person, as run away from
her homeshe was so pretty and lady-like!
You know'd her, sir?'
`Can you tell me any thing about her?'
asked Morris eagerly.
`Well, all I know, sir, is, that seeing as how
she was alone, and a stranger like in the city
and being so gentle and pleasant, I took a
liking to her, and asked her where she
wanted
to go, and she said to some Intelligence
office!'
`Good Heaven! I may be too late!'
exclaimed
Edward with a sudden energy, that
surprized them.
`She is your relation, sir, perhaps,'
ventured
Sherwood.
`Nobut I feel an interest in her welfare.'
`So would any body, I'm sure, sir.'
`What Intelligence office did she go to?'
`I can't tell that, as I couldn't go with her
myself, as I would ha' liked to, she was sich a
young and innocent thing, and so paid a
nigger
to show her one as she, poor thing, hadn't
any money but a short shillin', which I
wouldn't take from her. She paid me four
ten cent-pieces, instead of half a dollar, but
then I'll gladly make this up to the company,
out o' my own pocket.'
`You are very kind, sir,' said Morris, with
grateful emotion. `Shethat is, Iwill yet
remember your disinterested generosity. Can
you give me no clue to find where she went.'
`I can if I see that niggar, Jim Johnson,
that went with her, and carried her bundle for
her.'
`Could you not find him sir? Think! I will
amply reward your trouble.'
`I don't want to be paid, sir; I'd do any
thing for her I thought would benefit her.
Sam is always loafin' about the stage office,
sir, when he han't money: but just as sure as
he gets a sixpence, he streaks it off to Fve
Points to spree it out! I'll go up with you,
sir, to Twenty-one, and see if he is about
there. If I can find him, you can easily find
out where she is!'
`I am very sorry, sir, to interrupt your
breakfast,' said Edward: `but if you will go
up there with me, I will make it worth your
while.'
`I don't mind the trouble, sir, for I'd like to
have the young woman found, and better
taken care of than with her pretty face she
can take care of herself, in this wicked city.
Betty, wife, just put my breakfast to the fire;
I'll be back in a quarter of an hour. Come,
sir, I will go with you, and if Jim's to be
found, I'll find him.'
Morris thanked him for his readiness, while
he felt grateful to him for the honest and
kindhearted
interest he took in the lovely fugitive,
who, as he learned more and more of her
trials, grew more and more dear to him.
`John, you may drive back to No. 21,' he
said, as he regained the street; `I will walk
there with you, Mr. Sherwood.'
When Dick saw the fine establishment in
which our hero drove to his dwelling, and
saw with a practiced eye the blood of the
horses, he, insensibly to himself, showed more
alacrity to serve him. Dick liked a good
horse, and from the animal, always felt disposed
to transfer his admiration to the owner
`Sam Johnson, however, was not to be
found about the stage office, nor in the
precincts
.
He had left, Tom Conklin said, after
his drink, and taken the direction towards
Chatham Street.
`He's gone to the Five Points, sir,' said
Dick; `but if you was willing to go there,
you might as well expect to find a fat horse
in an omnibus, as find Sam, once he gets into
them dark holes there.'
`I would willingly drive there, and make
the search,' said Morris, with a look of
disappointment
.
`No, I'll tell you the best course to take,'
said Dick, brightening up at the idea; `I
know the niggar is too lazy to go far for an
Intelligence office, if he could find one near:
besides, I know he wa'n't long afore he came
back to me for the sixpence I promised to give
him, if he took the young woman safely to
one. So I think the best way'll be to go to
the nearest one, and so on, 'till you find the
right one. This can be sooner done than
finding the nigger.'
`You are right, my good friend, said
Morris
.
`I will do so.'
`You'll find a directory in the office, sir,'
said Dick, `and it'll show you the number
and street of all the 'telligence offices. Look
for them as is in the Chatham Street direction,
for that's the course Jim took her. Perhaps
she may have gone to the `benevolent office,
in Broadway, near Canal.'
In a few minutes, Edward had pencilled
down in his pocket-book the number of a
dozen offices, and returned to his buggy.
`I thank you for your kindness,' he said to
Sherwood, who stood patting the off horse on
the neck; `do me the favor to accept this,'
and he thrust a five dollar note into his hand.
`No, I am obliged to you, sir,' said Dick,
bluntly; `I never likes to be paid for doing
any body sich a service as this; I'd rather
you'd give me a good hearty shake o' the
hand, if it's the same to you.
`I'll do both,' said Edward, laughing, and
grasping his hand. `Good bye! I'll not
forget
you, though, for all that.'
Thus speaking, he got into his buggy, bade
John drive first through Walker Street to the
office founded by a benevolent society to
assist
,
gratuitously, servants to situations.
On alighting before the door, which was
thronged with persons of both sexes, who
looked at him, as he entered the crowded
room, anxiously, as if he might have come
for one of themselves. An old, benevolent
gentleman, with rough kind manners,
presided
at the little desk, like the patliarch of the
varied throng.
`Sir,' said Edward, `is there a young
woman
here by the name of Woodhull, who came
to town in the morning stage?'
`Woodhull?' said the old gentleman,
looking
round, and then lifting up his voice so as
to reach into the farther of the two rooms into
which his office was divided; `is there a
young woman here by the name of Woodhull?
What's her other name, sir!'
`Biddy or Bridget,' answered Morris with
embarrassment.
`Bridget Woodhull, answer to your name?'
added the old man.
There was a deep silence provailed through
the office, and Edward began to despair!
There was, at least, fifty females, of all ages
and varieties of appearance, seated on
benches
along the sides of both rooms; perhaps
Biddy might be there, and afraid or ashamed
to answer to her real name.
`Shall I look through the office, sir?' he
asked.
`Oh, yes, to be sure! Take off your veils,
and show your faces, all you that have honest
ones,' said the old gentleman, smiling; `this
person wants to see if any of you an't Bridget
Woodhull. Edward walked through the
rooms, and gave a hasty glance at each
countenance
,
some of them smiling, some cross,
others saucy, and others anxious and
expecting
,
but he saw no one there that looked like
the pretty hay-maker.
`Should such a person call here,' he said to
the director, `I would be obliged to you to
send me word, and detain her. Here is my
address.'
`Certainly, Mr. Morris; I will do so. Are
you a subscriber?'
`Subsbriber?'
`Yes, to the society. Every subscriber can
have the choice of servants 'till they are
suited
for a whole year, without additional
expense
;
and all warranted good and faithful
domestics.'
`Oh, yes, I understand you! but I don't
wan't a servant just now.'
`Oh, very wellif you take this Bridget,
of course you'll subscribe?'
`Certainly, sir, in that case,' said Morris,
confused. `Good morning, sir.'
`Good morning, Mr. Morris; I will look
for her. Do you want her for a nurse, or
chambermaid?'
`Confound the old fellow,' exclaimed
Morris
,
getting into his buggy, with a heightened
cheek! `Am I really in love with, and in
pursuit of a possible chambermaid! Well, I
will not stop to think about itfor I feel afraid
of reflection upon my present pursuit! I must
fulfil my destiny, and since it is that this
sweet hay-maker hath involved it in her's!
See herfind her I must!'
`Where shall I drive now, sir?' asked
John, with a covert smile, which the sensitive
young man instantly understood; he
hesitated
,
colored, and then said sharply
`To the stables, and put up your horses;
but be ready to leave town at any moment,
I will walk the rest of the way I have to go.'
With these words, Morris sprung to the
ground, and John drove alone off in the
direction
of Crosby Street. `And am I really
engaged in a pursuit that I am ashamed to
confess to my valet?' he asked of himself, as
his horses turned down Grand Street. I will
persevere, however. If she be all my
memory
and dreams have made her, she is well
worthy all my efforts to rescue her. She is
lovely, spirited, and all innocence! I will
not delay another moment, but seek her
through every Intelligence office in town, but
what I will find her!' With this generous
determination
he proceeded down Broadway to
Walker Street, and stopped at a neat little
office with No. 68 over the door. A young
pleasant smiling man, of genteel appearance,
stood at the desk, laughing and talking with
a fine looking English girl, while three or
four others were seated. Every eye was
upon
him, and the girls put on their best looks;
while the one with whom the office-keeper had
been conversing perhaps to while away the
time, wreathed her face in her finest smile, to
attract Edward's regard, as if she meant to
get a place through the recommendation of
her good looks. Edward, however, paid no
attention to her; but slightly glancing round
the office, and not seeing her whom he sought,
turned and asked the gentleman at the desk,
if she had been there.
`No, there has been no such person here,
sir,' said Mr. Scudderford, politely, and with
a look as if trying to recollect.
`I would thank you, if such a young
woman
should come, you would instantly send
me word,' he said, giving his address to him.
`I will certainly do so,' said the obliging
proprietor, and Edward left the office.
After visiting three other intelligence
offices
with equal success, he believed he should
have to give up the present pursuit of her,
and go in pursuit, with Dick Sherwood's
assistance
to recognize him, of the negro, Jim
Johnson. While deliberating whether to take
this step or not, he looked at his list, and
found that there were but two more offices
to be visited. One of these was in so obscure
and disreputable a street, that although it was
not far from where he then was, he thought
impossible, and shuddered at the idea that she
could have gone there; the other was in a
more respecatble portion of the city. `It is
possible,' he thought to himself, `that a
negro
who frequents the Five Points, would,
from congenial taste, guide a person to this
low place, rather than to the more respectable
one. I will try there! Am I indeed in my
senses? Am I Edward Morris in personto
be seeking through the purlieus of infamy
for a girl, whom I have seen but twice, with
the intention, if I find her, of making her my
wife! I will suppress thought and act, and
leave the issue to time, and the result of my
research.'
He now entered this street, disgusted with
the filth and the squalid poverty and
unkennelled
vice of the occupants of its hundred
cellars and miserable chambers. At length
he saw, before him the flashy tenement of
Beal Tucker, with the sign of
Intelligence
office, swinging above the door, the
first sight of which, two hours before, had
filled Biddy's thoughts with instant hopes of
`places' So long had Morris been engaged
in his indefatigable search, that it was already
nearly two o'clock, when he finally came to
this office. Beal Tucker had, but ten minutes
before despatched Biddy from his room, up
stairs, to Chamber Street, with her ragged,
freckled, saucy little rascal of a guide. He
had eaten his dinner, and already re-opening
his shop, where, however, but two or three
girls had appeared, who had not been there in
the morning, and so did not hear him say
he should not be open 'till two. But Beal
had succeeded in his little business affair with
Mr. Fitz Henry Barton, sooner, and more
successfully than he had anticipated he should
do before he left his office to call on that
interesting
young gentleman. He was now shut
up in his latticed desk or `counting room,' as
he dignified it, engaged, alternately, in
thinking
on his fifty dollars
in esse
, and
anticipating
his fifty, perhaps hundred and fifty,
in
posse
.
`Good day's job!' he said rubbing his hands
together. `Ah, here's a customer. Not a
family man, I see, by his looks. He don't
want any women folks. Don't look as if he
wanted a mistress, neither, he, he, he.
Perhaps
he wants a man servant! Sir, your most
obedient! Fine day, sir!' he said as Morris
entered the low room.
`Yes,' said Morris, coldly and haughtily, at
once taking a decided dislike to him.
Beal wasn't much gratified by his manner,
and his heart recipocated Morris' antipathy.
The causes of impulsive dislike between
strangers
,
a first sight, is a theme that deserves to
enlist the ablest writer on metaphysicial
philosophy
.
Swedenbourg, we believe, has
accounted
for every emotion and impulse of the
human mind but this. Is it connected,
remotely
,
with animal magnetism. Will Mr
Dawes or Doctor Collier answer? There
might have been some secret spring upon
which the sympathies of their knowledge of
Biddythe one for evil, the other for good,
met on common ground. But we stop, for
we feel we are encroaching upon the mystic
regions of transcendentalism obscurity.
`Can you tell me?' asked Edward, with
as much grace of speech as his dislike for Mr.
Tucker would let him use, `if a young
woman
,
calling herself Bridget Woodhull, has
been here to-day, seeking a place!'
Instantly Beal Tucker's keener
faculties
were set, for he felt he had a part to
Edward's appearance, and the gravity
pw
which he made the inquiry, showed him
that
he was the young girl's friend, and would be,
if he was not already, her honorable
protector
.
Perhaps a cousin, or some poor distant
relation, thought he. Perhaps a real young
lady disguised! A hundred surmises ran
through his active mind in the interval
between
Morris' question, and his reply; but
his determination to conceal his knowledge
of Biddy, remained firm as it had been instant
in its formation.
`Biddy Woodhull,' he repeated in a
doubtful
tone, looking round his office, and seeing
that those present had not seen her when she
was there, `let me see, I think there was
some such person here yesterday.'
`No, to-day. sir.'
`Oh, to-day. Well, perhaps it was to-day!
I'll look at my books and see:' And the cool
and studied hypocrite turned over the leaves
of his books of entries, and seemed to be
thoughtfully humming down the list of names,
at intervals repeating, `BiddyBiddy!
WoodhullWoodhull!' At length he
stopped
,
making a place with his finger. `The
name is Woodhull, you said, I believe?'
Edward's heart was in his mouth! he
believed
he had now found her! Beal Tucker
meant he should believe so! his looks,
manners
,
and tone, as he put the question, were
intended for deception! `Yes,' gasped
Edward
`Ah, then this can't be it! this is
Woodford
Betty
Woodford,' said Beal, with a
quiet
,
malicious smile, as he shut the book which
contained no such name as he had
represented
.
He saw from Edward's change of
countenance
,
how deep had been the
disappointment
to the hopes he had raised, and he felt
very happyfor another's misery always was
gratifying to Beal, especialy if he himself was
in any way instrumental in producing it. His
sagacious penetration gave him also a pretty
correct clue to Morris' anxiety to find her!
but his own impure nature led him to do
injustice in his suspicions to the purity of
Morris' intentions! Yet if Morris had
offered
him down two hundred dollars, to find
Biddy, he would have betrayed Barton, and
produced her, if he could have done so
without
implicating himself in the previous
villanous
transaction in which the two had been
mutually engaged.
Morris was turning to leave the office,
when his eye glanced through the lattice
upon
a card carelessly laving upon the desk.
On it he saw written, `Bridget Woodhull.'
There were other words beneath, which he
could not read at a glance.
`By heaven, sir, there is the very name!'
he cried, fixing upon Beal a look of angry
suspicion.
Beal Tucker had seen his eye fall on the
name he had taken down, and instantly,
though quietly took up the card, lest he should
also read read the minutes below: viz. `West
Chester Countyaged about sixteenvery
beautifulwith black eyes and hairnever
in the city before, and never lived out!
`Biddy Woodhull, I think it was. you asked
me for, sir?' said Beal, coolly, tearing in
pieces the card which he had forgotten to
take with him to Barton.
`Biddy and Bridget both are one and the
same name,' answered Morris, warmly.
`If you wish, then, for a Bridget
Woodhull
,
why that is a different matter aliogether,
sir! Gentlemen should be accurate when
they inquire for dames!'
Morris felt like knocking him down, but he
restrained the impulse, knowing that he had
to do with a elever villain, and that he could
only effect his ultimate object by being calm.
`Can you then tell me any thing about
Bridget Woodhull, whose name you had taken
down on that card?' he demanded.
`Why there was a young woman who gave
me the name you mention, to get her a place,
some time this forenoon, but as she had no
money, I did not enter her name in my books
'till she could bring money to pay me. My
price, sir, is half a dollar in advance. So after
sitting here awhile, she got up and went
away.'
Morris looked at Beal Tucker earnestly
while he spoke, and his voice was even, and
his face without any particularly marked
expression
of deceit, and as the story he told was
plausible, he could not but give credit to it.
He now became distressed at her probable fate.
He then prepared to quit the office, but
turned
back to say he would give him ten dollars,
if he could obtain any intelligence of her
Beal smiled, for ten dollars was not one
hundred
.
Morris then bade him good-day, and
was going out, when a ragged little imp, who
had been waiting on the doorstep for some
time for Beal to get through with Morris, now
came in impatient of his delay, and said in his
coarse sancy manner
`I say, Beal Tucker, I have seen your young
miss to Chamber street. I know'd the figurs
soon as I seed 'em! Numb'
`
Hu-s-s-sh!
' said Beal, menacingly, and
glancing at Morris, who was in the act of
going out.
`
Sh!
I'm hanged if I'll
Sh!
' said the boy
impatiently. `I axed the girl to fork over a
shillin' and the critter said she hadn't a red
cent. Now fork over old 'un!' and the boy
thrust his dirty paw through the slats of the
desk.
`If you don't hold your tongue, I'll give
you nothing,' alarmed lest in some way
Morris
should discover the identity of the person
the boy had guided, with Biddy Woodhull.
Morris, however, saw in the boy's entrance
and language, nothing that could lead him to
suspect him in any way linked in the
puzzling
chain that intervened between him and
her, and only glancing at the boy, he passed
out, with a heart shrinking with
disappointment
,
and without possessing any further
probable clue to her discovery. He slowly
took his way up the street, looking into every
face he met, with faint and dreary hope of
possibly seeing that he so ardently and
passionately
sought.
`I won't take less than a shillin' ' said the
boy, as Beal handed him a five cent piece'
`Come, old Tucker, out with your dust!'
`I'll kick you into the street if you ask me
for more,' said Beal, between anger and
avarice
.
`I guess you won't,' said the boy,
decidedly
.
`Come pony up.'
`Get out o' my office,' roared Beal, taking
a rattan, and shaking it at the boy.
`I say, Beal Tucker,' said the boy, not at
all intimidated, `I know a thing or two,' and
he put his thumb to his nose, and made a rapid
and significant movement with the fingers of
his open hand.
`Know, what do you know, you young
rascal
?'
asked Beal, his voice falling.
`That gemman wan't in here for nothing, I
guess,' answered the boy, mysteriously.
`Here, my lad, here's a sixpense for you,'
said Beal, coaxingly.
`I doesn't take less than a quarter,' said the
boy. `I axes the extra shillin' for being called
a rascal. I always axes a shillin' for that.'
`A quarter! you young scoundrel, I'll flog
you.'
`Well, if you won't pay me for the gal, I
know who will; if he'd give you ten dollars
to know where she is, he'd give it to me, I
reckon. I heard all your talk afore I come
in.'
`Hush, boy!' said Beal becoming pale.
`Look here! there's a quarter nowand two
cents more to it. Take it and go. You don't
think the young woman he was asking for,
that one you showed into Chamber street, do
you?' said Beal, trying to laugh.
`I doesn't think it, but I knows it,' said the
boy, stoutly. `I read her name on her pocket
handkercher what her bundle I carried was
tied up in.'
`The devil you did. Well, well, I didn't
want him to think it was the person, because
I know'd he was mighty anxious to see her,
and I knew he'd offer something. It was the
ten dollars I was waiting for, Bob. I'll get it,
you see, for I mean to send him word by and
by, and I'll give you half.'
`Oh, cricky!' said Bob, affecting to be
highly pleased, `I take!' But he saw with
the acute penetration characteristic of New
York boys of his class, at the bottom of Beal's
subterfuge at once. But wishing not to
betray
to Beal that he was too deep for him, he
pretended that he was blinded, and pocketing
the money he went out of the office whistling
Jim-a-long-Josey.
`The infernal rascal!' said Beal, as Bob
went out of sight, `He like to have suspected
and he then would have made a pretty mess
of it! But I have galled him this time; lost
a twenty-two cents by it, for I didn't mean to
give the scamp more than five pence. I
wonder
what the devil this young man wanted
with her? Not for the same purpose Barton
does, I am sure, for he looks like a different
sort of person. I should like his ten dollars;
but never mind; Barton has feathered my nest
soft enough for one day! Hush that
jabber-jabber
there, girl! don't you see I'm thinking?'
And Beal Tucker resumed his thoughtful,
scheming attitude, with his hand on his
forehead
and his elbow on his desk.
Edward Morris took his way at a slow,
uncertain
pace along the street in which Beal
Tucker's Intelligence office stood, towards
Broadway. The more he reflected on the
conduct of Beal, the more convinced he
became
that he knew more about Biddy than
he revealed. But the plausibility of the story
he told him, that she was without money,
and he wouldn't get a place for her 'till she
paid, recurred to his mind, and he
became
undecided and perplexed. He was just
entering Broadway, his thoughts dwelling on
the sad and hopeless subject, when he felt his
sleeve pulled; looking round he saw and
recognized
the same little freckled face urchin
that had entered the office and demanded a
sixpence of Beal as he was coming out of it.
`I say, mister, wan't you axing after a
young 'ooman down to Beal Tucker's
'telligence
office?'
`Yes, my man,' replied Morris, with a
kindling
of hope. `Do you know anything about
her?'
`Don't be too quick, mister! What I knows
I knows, and knows how to keep, too!'
answered
the boy with shrewd caution.
Edward placed in his hand half a dollar,
and at the same time asked eagerly, `Now
tell me what you know about her?'
`Wan't her name Biddy Woodhull?' asked
or rather asserted the lad.
`Yes; you know where she is to be found,
by your looks and manners.'
`So does Beal Tucker,' said the boy with
a grin, `for all he nam'd you off with a cock
and bull story.'
`Did he lie to me, then,' asked Morris,
with angry surprise.
`Like an auctioneer! You don't know
Beal Tucker I guess, mister.'
`But the young woman?'
`He knew all about her when you was
there, pumpin' him! There's` something
green in your eye, I reckon.'
`There's nothing green in yours, or about
you,' said Morris, laughing at the forwardness
of a boy hardly eleven years of age. What
motive could Mr. Tucker have in deceiving
me?'
`That's his own look out, not mine; you're
too hard for me there. But vot'll you give
me if I'll tell you where she is this blessed
minute?'
`Five dollars, if you will show me the
house, so that I can see her.'
`I'll show you the house, but as for seeing
the young 'ooman, vy you'll have to use your
own eyes, and not look to me for a pair. I
just came from showing her where she is,
where Beal Tucker told me to.'
`Good heavens! and it was for this
service
that you came in and demanded a
shilling
as I was leaving?' exclaimed Edward
with astonishment.
`Yes, and I made him fork out a quarter
and two red cents, coz I told him I know'd
what you were a'ter and I'd call on you and
make you pay for showin' the young 'ooman
the way.'
`Infamous villain! Show me instantly,
my boy, where you left her, and I will give
you five dollars,' said Edward, wondering
why the Intelligence office keeper should so
deceive him without any apparent motive for
so doing. Edward, however, had got to come
to the knowledge of one avenue of iniquitous
guilt in New York, of the existence and
practice
of which he had not the remotest
conception
.
His suspicions, therefore, in the
present
instance, though active, were wholly at
fault.
`Five dollars ain't enough, mister; give
me what you promised Beal Tucker and it's
done.'
`Ten dollars; well, I will give it to you.
Conduct me at once, and you shall receive the
money at the door.'
`Half down is fair play,' said the boy,
extending
his hand.
Morris placed a five dollar note in his hand
and then impetiently motioned him to
proceed
.
The boy looked sharply at the bill, as if he
could decide by his instinctive sharpness
whether
it were a genuine note, and then
apparently
satisfied, he thrust it into some
unknown
region of his tattered garments, and
darted up the street into Broadway.
Morris followed him at a rapid pace along
the iron fence of the Park until they came to
Chambers street, down which the boy turned
looking round to see if he was in the track.
The sight of the street reminded him of his
relative, Barton, and he hesitated lest he might
possibly fall in with him, and he did not feel
in any mood for being stopped by any of his
acquaintances. He, however, followed the
boy down the street twenty or thirty
numbers
,
and as he approached Barton's rooms he
drew his cap over his brows and walked at a
quick step, that he might not be recognized.
But judge of his surprise when the boy
suddenly
stopped at Barton's very door, and
pointing, with a jerk of his chin, at the
number
,
said
`Here's the place, mister. I'd know the
figurs if I seed 'em in Jerusalem.'
Morris was thunderstruck. He stood
transfixed
with surprise and incredulity. He
looked
steadily and inquiringly at the boy, in
whose face was a sort of dogged certainty and
assurance of there being no mistake, that
convinced him there was none.
`And did you leave that young woman
here?' he asked in a deep, earnest and a
severe
tone that made the boy shrink from it
and the gaze of his eyes.
`Yes, I did, sir, and I seed her go in after
I'd got to the head o' the street. She cooldn't
find the bell knob, and a man going by ringed
it for her.'
`And she went in, you are sure?'
`I seed her with my own eyes, to make
sure she was going to live there, cos I meant
to get that sixpence for carryin' her bundle
out on her some day, when she got flush.
There's a manty-maker lives there, Tucker
said.'
Morris was not a fool, though ignorant of
the numerous ways and means of villany and
vice. A moment's reflection, with the
knowledge
he possessed of Barton's character, gave
him a full explanation of Beal Tucker's
motive
in deceiving him.
`Yes,' he said to himself, `Barton has
made her his victim. Boy, here is you pay,'
he said giving him another note for five
dollars
;
now go.
The lad did not require to be told twice, and
bounded off in the possession of greater
riches
than he had ever before been the honest
possessor of. Morris looked again at the
number lest he might have been mistaken.
It was that of Barton's house. He knew it
well, for he had often visited him, especially
before Barton had become so dissipated.
Indeed
he had been so intimate as to hold a pass
key, both to his outer door and to his library.
Neither of these he had now with him. Once
the idea struck him that possibly Barton had
moved, and that a mantua-maker lived there.
But a glance at the windows, showed him
that Battons curlains still remained there.
There was then, no error, Biddy was decoyed
under the libertines roof.
`Yes, I will rescne or avenge her!' he said,
with determined energy, `Barton is a
sconndrel
!
and he shall die by my hand if he has
injured her!'
His first thought was to ring the bell, but
this he saw at once would defeat his purpose
of surprise, even if it should be answered.
He therefore sprung over the iron railing into
the area, to force open the basement door. To
his delight and surprise it was on the latch.
Fred having been too anxious to avail
himself
of his permission to be absent to stop and
secure it. Entering the lower passage he
lightly and rapidly ascended the stairs. All
was silent on the first floor, but he heard the
quick, rapid movement of feet above him.
He flew up the other stairs, and as he did so,
heard a shrick, a crash, and then a fall,
accompanied
by a loud cry, in a man's voice, of
mingled terror and pain! He sprung to the
upper landing with fearful foreboding. The
door of the library stood open torn from its
lock. He bounded forward into the room
and beheld a scene that filled him with
amazement
and terrific surprise. In the middle of
the floor lay Barton prostrate on his back with
a huge ban-dog holding him fiercely by the
throat. He was pale as death, and struck
with mortal fear. Near the bed-room door
stood Biddy Woodhull, her hair
dishevelled
and her kerehief torn from her neck.
Her attitude was one of mingled terror and
gratitude. Her dark eyes were flashing with
fire which streaming tears could not quench.
Her virgin bosom heaved with quick and
strong feeling; her whole beautiful person
was eloquent and instinct with indignation
and womanly emotion. How beautiful, how
touchingly beautiful she looked at that
moment
.
She instantly recognized him and
uttered
a cry of joy. He rushed forward and
caught her in his arms, and then pressed her
to his heart!'
`Thank God you're safe!' he cried with
mingled indignation and gratitute.
`Yes, sir, said Biddy, whose full heart was
gushing through her eyes, `I am safe.
Bruin
is my preserver. Oh! sir, heaven hath
sent you here as I was wishing you?'
`Wishing for me?' repeated Morris, with
delight; then you have not forgotten me!'
`Forgotten you?' she repeated with warmth,
`Oh no, sir!' and her face was suffused with
lovely confusion.
Mr. Fitz Henry Barton, the while, lay on
the floor upon his back, with Bruin's teeth
fastened in the delicate bow of his neckcloth,
much to the derangement of that exquisite
part of his costume. When Biddy fled from
him and found herself in the bathing room
instead
of in an avenue of escape, she turned
back and encountered him in the chamber.
He threw his arms around her. She
struggled
in vain, and uttered shriek on shriek.
Appalled by her outcries, Barton released her,
when she flew back into the library. He
waited
an instant to restore his courage and
confirm
himself in his purpose by a tumbler of
brandy, and then seized her as she had raised
the window and was springing out. She
uttered
a piercing cry of despair, when
suddenly
she heard it answered by Bruin's loud bark
on the outside of the door.
`Bruin! Bruin! Oh, Bruin!' she
shrieked
,
with difficulty as he laid his hand firmly
upon her mouth. The dog heard and
answered
by fierce whines, and at length dashed
himself against the door with such strength
that he forced it from its bolt and bounded at
a leap into the midst of the room. With a
furious bark he sprang at once at the
astonished
and horrified Barton's throat, who had
Biddy
in his arms bearing her from the library.
He released her with a cry of terrible fear,
and fell, dragged bodily to the floor by the
huge mastiff. It was at this crisis that
Edward
Morris made his appearance. Biddy
related all this to Edward in a few eloquent
words.
So soon as the prostrate roue could
articulate
,
he cried in an imploring tone,
`Oh, Morris! dear Morris! for the love of
heaven take off the dog! He will suffocate
me! he will! Oh, he will! I shall die of
strangulation!'
`Infamous scounnrel,' muttered Morris,
looking down upon him with pity and
contempt
.
`But, oh! I shall certainly die here! Do
good Miss Biddy, call off the dog! Oh! oh!
Godoh!'
Morris, seeing that he was really in danger
of being strangled by the revengeful animal,
and that he could speak with great difficulty,
and was rapidly turning black in the face, he
asked Biddy to call him away from him. The
dog instantly obeyed, and releasing his hold
came and licked her hand with mute affection.
Mr. Fitz Henry Barton got to his feet with
difficulty and staggered to an ottoman.
Morris
looked at him a long time in stern silence.
At length he turned to Biddy, in whose little
heart indignation and terror had been
displaced
by gratitude and love. Was it indeed the
noble young man whose image she had so
long cherished in her heart in whose presence
she now was. And did he really regard her
with tenderness. His looks, ay, and
manners
,
all told her the deep and tender interest
he took in her. He looked at with the deep
gaze of impassioned devotion into her dark
eyes, and said, while he pressed her hand,
`Sweet girl! this is a happy hour to me. I
heard of your flight from home, and have
been secking you all through the city.
Heaven
has directed me hither to protect you and
to offer you my heart and fortnne. Say I am
not indifferent to you!'
`Oh, no, no! Indeed, sir, I have thought of
you every day since I saw you,' said she,
artlessly
.
`I think I care for nobody else in the
world but you. Indeed, sir, I never was so
happy in my life as I am now. I have
wondered
very much where you were, that you
did not come to see me after that pleasrnt
hour beneath the apple tree.'
Edward's soul drank the words of her frank
and ingenuous confession, and he felt that he
was indeed loved.
A few words, by way of summary, will
close this tale. Morris took Biddy home to
his father's that day, and told the old
gentleman
her history. He was deeply interested
in it, and took a decided fancy to her. She
remained there three days unknown to her
family, and then Morris, after being satisfied
of her pure attachment to him, sent her to
Madam Canda's fashionable boarding school,
under an assumed name, as he wished to keep
all knowledge of her from her mother and
sisters. At the end of two years, he took her
to his father's house and made her his wife.
Never lovelier bride stood beside an alter to
pledge her troth to him of her virgin hearts's
choice. This summer they have been to
Saratoga
and the Falls; and every where the
lovely Mrs. Edward Morris has been the
cynosure
of all eyes. The cross mother and
envious sisters heard that the beautiful young
lady at Woodburn about to be married to its
heir was Biddy. But they were not invited
to the wedding, nor would Edward allow his
wife to recognise any of the family except
honest old David Woodhull, her father, who
was at the wedding, in a new blue snit,
presented
by Morris as a bridal gift. A chapter
might be written on the envy and
mortification
of Biddy's mother and Miss Euphrosia.
Mr. Fitz Henry Barton left town the next day
after his disgrace for the White Sulpher, and
thence he went to Europe, from whence he
has recently returned with his hair growing
all over his face, after the Parisian fashion,
and with a great antipathy to dogs, which he
disrespectfully anathemizes as `demnition
brutes.' Beal Tucker fled to Texas to avoid
a prosecution with which Morris threatened
him.
Bruin, the faithful old ban-dog may be seen
any day in summer lounging at gentlemanly
leisure about the lawn and portico of
Woodburn
,
or in winter taking his comfort on the
hearth rug beside old Mr. Morris' foot-stool.
One of Morris' first acts, after sending Biddy
to Madame Canda's, was to call on honest
Dick Sherwood, and offer him the tenancy of
one of his farms near Fordham, rent free for
five years. Dick, has therefore, left the road
and taken to agriculture. He says he never
knew `four short bits' turn out so well in the
long run, and it is his favorite maxim, that a
man never loses any thing by being generous.
Tom Conklin was, until last week, still
patronizing
No. 21, Bowery, with his presence, and
managing to keep just half and half through
the day. But last week one of the
committee
of the Washington Temperance Union
got wind of Tom, and took him up to the
Temperance Hall. Tom was, therefore,
suddenly
seized with a love of temperance and
signed his fist to the pledge. He has not
drank a drop since, and after his month's
probation
is up he has the promise of being pro
moted to drive a cabhe has fixed on No. 179
as it has four wheels, and he thinks looks
more respectable. Jim Johnson is become
second boot-black to Peter Kobash, boot black.
No. Elebenteen, Jim Crow Alley. Freckled
Bob made his ten dollars, the capital for a
`root beer' speculation, and has made it so
profitable that he intends removing from his
present stand at the lamp-post opposite the
Astor, into a snug shop corner of Centre and
Duane, and increase his stock by
confectionary
,
pies, and apple tarts. Thus having
disposed
of the several characters in our tale,
after
the approved method recommeneed by
Mrs. Radcliffe, and adopted by the novelists,
we beg leave to subscribe ourselves, the
reader's

New York
,
July
, 1838.
Dear Ned
:
What a demnition time you are staying out
South. What you can find to keep you there
this dem hot weather one hour after your
aunt's business is done for, unless some
pretty
pearl, I'm dem'd if I can tell! Every thing
goes on just as ever. I had a glorious drive
last Friday on the avenue with Bob-tailed
Brown, harnessed single in my green buggy.
Tom Weston had a new team out, a dem'd
handsome thing altogether, and came behind
me like a streak of lightning. But I touched
Bob and left Tom half a mile in the rear as I
drew rein at the Harlem tavern. Dem'd good
that, wasn't it! I run over a sow and a litter
of nine pigs. Did'nt the young 'uns
scamper
a few. I took off a goose's neck with my
off wheel as neat as you could cut it with a
knife. Tom swore Bob was the best bit o'
horse flesh in New York. Saw a pretty gearl
on the side-walklooked like a ruralbut I
was too anxious to beat Tom Weston's mare
to stop and ask her where she lived.
Sunday
went over to Hoboken and saw lots o'
second quality class beauties, but couldn't do
any thing in my way, as they always have
some of those chaps with a bob coat, round
slick hat with a narrow crape round it, their
hair plaited down on each cheek, aad their
bosoms open, and cuffs and shirt-wristbands
turned back as if they were ready at any
moment
for a fight. I can't endure such vulgar
people! though I don't mind a set-to, for I
have the true science you know, Ned. Havn't
been out of town yet, but I believe I shall go
to Saratoga next month. Saratogo is getting
to be low now that every shop-keeper that
can command three dollars can go there.
These steamboats and railroads are getting to
be great levellers, Ned. I think I must go
to the White Sulphurs, they are the most
exclusive
.
Low people can't afford to get there
I saw your uncle last week in Broadway. He
would have passed me without seeing me, but
I stopped to ask him the name of the farmer
on the farm next to his above on the creek
where the rural lives. He told me it was
Woodhull. If you don't come on soon I
shall go down there and get up a little
flirtation
with her. I think she's too pretty to be
suffered to grow there unnoticed like a sweet
flower under a hedge. Well, I have no more
to write. By the by, my friend Mks has
let his beard grow all over his chin and it
looks dem'd fine. I think I shall follow his
example. He is going to be confirmed at St.
Thomas'. Religion is a nice thing for sick
and old people, but it spoils life for your true
blood!
In haste yours,
Fitz Henry Barton

P. S. Tom Weston's mare stumbled this
afternoon and pitched Tom out on his head
and killed him. How dem'd unlucky, for I
meant to have another race with Tom, for a
basket of `Star Brand.' The mare wasn't
hurt! wasn't that demnition lucky? F. B.'
