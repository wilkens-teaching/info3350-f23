VOL. II. 1
BOOK THE THIRD.
Take away the lights, too;
The moon lends me too much to find my fears;
And those devotions I am now to pay,
Are written in my heart, not in thy book;
And I shall read them there without a taper.
BOOK THE THIRD.
CHAPTER I.
SUMMER-TIME.
They
were right,those old German
Minnesingers
,to
sing the pleasant summer-time!
What a time it is! How June stands illuminated
in the Calendar! The windows are all wide
open; only the Venetian blinds closed. Here
and there a long streak of sunshine streams in
through a crevice. We hear the low sound of
the wind among the trees; and, as it swells and
freshens, the distant doors clap to, with a sudden
sound. The trees are heavy with leaves; and
the gardens full of blossoms, red and white. The
whole atmosphere is laden with perfume and
sunshine
.
The birds sing. The cock struts about,
and crows loftily. Insects chirp in the grass.
Yellow butter-cups stud the green carpet like
golden buttons, and the red blossoms of the
clover
like rubies. The elm-trees reach their long,
pendulous branches almost to the ground. White
clouds sail aloft; and vapors fret the blue sky with
silver threads. The white village gleams afar
against the dark hills. Through the meadow winds
the river,careless, indolent. It seems to love
the country, and is in no haste to reach the sea.
The bee only is at work,the hot and angry
bee. All things else are at play; he never plays,
and is vexed that any one should.
People drive out from town to breathe, and to
be happy. Most of them have flowers in their
hands; bunches of apple-blossoms, and still oftener
lilacs. Ye denizens of the crowded city, how
pleasant to you is the change from the sultry
streets to the open fields, fragrant with
clover-blossoms
!
how pleasant the fresh, breezy country
air, dashed with brine from the meadows! how
pleasant, above all, the flowers, the manifold,
beautiful flowers!
It is no longer day. Through the trees rises
the red moon, and the stars are scarcely seen. In
the vast shadow of night, the coolness and the
dews descend. I sit at the open window to enjoy
them; and hear only the voice of the summer
wind. Like black hulks, the shadows of the great
trees ride at anchor on the billowy sea of grass. I
cannot see the red and blue flowers, but I know
that they are there. Far away in the meadow
gleams the silver Charles. The tramp of horses'
hoofs sounds from the wooden bridge. Then all
is still, save the continuous wind of the summer
night. Sometimes I know not if it be the wind
or the sound of the neighbouring sea. The village
clock strikes; and I feel that I am not alone.
How different is it in the city! It is late, and
the crowd is gone. You step out upon the
balcony
,
and lie in the very bosom of the cool, dewy
night, as if you folded her garments about you.
The whole starry heaven is spread out overhead.
Beneath lies the public walk with trees, like a
fathomless, black gulf, into whose silent darkness
the spirit plunges and floats away, with some
beloved
spirit clasped in its embrace. The lamps
are still burning up and down the long street.
People go by, with grotesque shadows, now
foreshortened
and now lengthening away into the
darkness and vanishing, while a new one springs
up behind the walker, and seems to pass him on
the sidewalk. The iron gates of the park shut
with a jangling clang. There are footsteps, and
loud voices;a tumult,a drunken brawl,an
alarm of fire;then silence again. And now at
length the city is asleep, and we can see the
night. The belated moon looks over the roofs, and
finds no one to welcome her. The moonlight is
broken. It lies here and there in the squares, and
the opening of streets,angular, like blocks of
white marble.
Under such a green, triumphal arch, O Reader!
with the odor of flowers about thee, and the
song of birds, shalt thou pass onward into the
enchanted
land, as through the Ivory Gate of dreams!
And as a prelude and majestic march, one sweet
human voice, I know not whose, but coming from
the bosom of the Alps, sings this sublime ode,
which the Alpine echoes repeat afar.
Come, golden Evening! In the west
Enthrone the storm-dispelling sun,
And let the triple rainbow rest
O'er all the mountain tops;'t is done;
The tempest ceases; bold and bright,
The rainbow shoots from hill to hill;
Down sinks the sun; on presses night;
Mont Blanc is lovely still!
There take thy stand, my spirit;spread
The world of shadows at thy feet;
And mark how calmly overhead,
The stars, like saints in glory, meet.
While, hid in solitude sublime,
Methinks I muse on Nature's tomb,
And hear the passing foot of Time
Step through the silent gloom.
All in a moment, crash on crash,
From precipice to precipice,
An avalanche's ruins dash
Down to the nethermost abyss,
Invisible; the ear alone
Pursues the uproar till it dies;
Echo to Echo, groan for groan,
From deep to deep, replies.
Silence again the darkness seals,
Darkness that may be felt;but soon
The silver-clouded east reveals
The midnight spectre of the moon;
In half-eclipse she lifts her horn,
Yet, o'er the host of heaven supreme,
Brings the faint semblance of a morn,
With her awakening beam.
Ah! at her touch, these Alpine heights
Unreal mockeries appear;
With blacker shadows, ghastlier lights,
Emerging as she climbs the sphere;
A crowd of apparitions pale!
I hold my breath in chill suspense,
They seem so exquisitely frail,
Lest they should vanish hence.
1*
I breathe again, I freely breathe;
Thee, Leman's Lake, once more I trace,
Like Dian's crescent far beneath,
As beautiful as Dian's face:
Pride of the land that gave me birth!
All that thy waves reflect I love,
Where heaven itself, brought down to earth,
Looks fairer than above.
Safe on thy banks again I stray;
The trance of poesy is o'er,
And I am here at dawn of day,
Gazing on mountains as before,
Where all the strange mutations wrought,
Were magic feats of my own mind;
For, in that fairy land of thought,
Whate'er I seek, I find.
CHAPTER II.
FOOT-TRAVELLING.
Tell
me, my soul, why art thou restless?
Why dost thou look forward to the future with
such strong desire? The present is thine,and
the past;and the future shall be! O that
thou didst look forward to the great hereafter with
half the longing wherewith thou longest for an
earthly future,which a few days at most will
bring thee! to the meeting of the dead, as to the
meeting of the absent! Thou glorious spirit-land!
O, that I could behold thee as thou art,the
region
of life, and light, and love, and the
dwelling-place
of those beloved ones, whose being has flowed
onward like a silver-clear stream into the
solemn-sounding
main, into the ocean of Eternity.
Such were the thoughts that passed through the
soul of Flemming, as he lay in utter solitude and
silence on the rounded summit of one of the
mountains
of the Furca Pass, and gazed, with tears in
his eyes, and ardent longing in his heart, up into
the blue-swimming heaven overhead, and at the
glaciers and snowy mountain-peaks around him.
Highest and whitest of all, stood the peak of the
Jungfrau, which seemed near him, though it rose
afar off from the bosom of the Lauterbrunner Thal.
There it stood, holy and high and pure, the bride
of heaven, all veiled and clothed in white, and
lifted
the thoughts of the beholder heavenward. O,
he little thought then, as he gazed at it with
longing
and delight, how soon a form was to arise in
his own soul, as holy, and high, and pure as this,
and like this point heavenward.
Thus lay the traveller on the mountain summit,
reposing his weary limbs on the short, brown grass,
which more resembled moss than grass. He had
sent his guide forward, that he might be alone.
His soul within him was wild with a fierce and
painful delight. The mountain air excited him;
the mountain solitudes enticed, yet maddened him.
Every peak, every sharp, jagged iceberg, seemed
to pierce him. The silence was awful and
sublime
.
It was like that in the soul of a dying man,
when he hears no more the sounds of earth. He
seemed to be laying aside his earthly garments.
The heavens were near unto him; but between
him and heaven every evil deed he had done arose
gigantic, like those mountain-peaks, and breathed
an icy breath upon him. O, let not the soul that
suffers, dare to look Nature in the face, where she
sits majestically aloft in the solitude of the
mountains
;
for her face is hard and stern, and looks not
in compassion upon her weak and erring child. It
is the countenance of an accusing archangel, who
summons us to judgment. In the valley she wears
the countenance of a Virgin Mother, looking at us
with tearful eyes, and a face of pity and love!
But yesterday Flemming had come up the
valley
of the Saint Gothard Pass, through Amsteg,
where the Kerstelenbach comes dashing down the
Maderaner Thal, from its snowy cradle overhead.
The road is steep, and runs on zigzag terraces.
The sides of the mountains are barren cliffs; and
from their cloud-capped summits, unheard amid the
roar of the great torrent below, come streams of
snowwhite foam, leaping from rock to rock, like
the mountain chamois. As you advance, the scene
grows wilder and more desolate. There is not a
tree in sight,not a human habitation. Clouds,
black as midnight, lower upon you from the
ravines
overhead; and the mountain torrent
beneath
is but a sheet of foam, and sends up an
incessant
roar. A sudden turn in the road brings
you in sight of a lofty bridge, stepping from cliff to
cliff with a single stride. A fearful cataract howls
beneath it, like an evil spirit, and fills the air with
mist; and the mountain wind claps its hands and
shrieks through the narrow pass, Ha! ha!This
is the Devil's Bridge. It leads the traveller across
the fearful chasm, and through a mountain gallery
into the broad, green, silent meadow of
Andermath
.
Even the sunny morning, which followed this
gloomy day, had not chased the desolate
impression
from the soul of Flemming. His excitement
increased as he lost himself more and more among
the mountains; and now, as he lay all alone on the
summit of the sunny hill, with only glaciers and
snowy peaks about him, his soul, as I have said,
was wild with a fierce and painful delight.
A human voice broke his reverie. He looked,
and beheld at a short distance from him, the
athletic
form of a mountain herdsman, who was
approaching
the spot where he lay. He was a young
man, clothed in a rustic garb, and holding a long
staff in his hand. When Flemming rose, he stood
still, and gazed at him, as if he loved the face of
man, even in a stranger, and longed to hear a
human
voice, though it might speak in an unknown
tongue. He answered Flemming's salutation in a
rude mountain dialect, and in reply to his
questions
said;
I, with two others, have charge of two
hundred
head of cattle on these mountains. Through
the two summer months we remain here night and
day; for which we receive each a Napoleon.
Flemming gave him half his summer wages.
He was glad to do a good deed in secret, and yet
so near heaven. The man received it as his due,
like a toll-keeper; and soon after departed, leaving
the traveller alone. And the traveller went his
way down the mountain, as one distraught. He
stopped only to pluck one bright blue flower,
which bloomed all alone in the vast desert, and
looked up at him, as if to say; O take me with
you! leave me not here companionless!
Ere long he reached the magnificent glacier of
the Rhone; a frozen cataract, more than two
thousand
feet in height, and many miles broad at its
base. It fills the whole valley between two
mountains
,
running back to their summits. At the base
it is arched, like a dome; and above, jagged and
rough, and resembles a mass of gigantic crystals,
of a pale emerald tint, mingled with white. A
snowy crust covers its surface; but at every rent
and crevice the pale green ice shines clear in the
sun. Its shape is that of a glove, lying with the
palm downwards, and the fingers crooked and
close together. It is a gauntlet of ice, which,
centuries
ago, Winter, the King of these mountains,
threw down in defiance to the Sun; and year by
year the Sun strives in vain to lift it from the
ground on the point of his glittering spear. A
feeling of wonder and delight came over the soul
of Flemming when he beheld it, and he shouted
and cried aloud;
How wonderful! how glorious!
After lingering a few hours in the cold, desolate
valley, he climbed in the afternoon the steep
Mayen-Wand, on the Grimsel, passed the Lake of
the Dead, with its ink-black waters; and through
the melting snow, and over slippery
stepping-stones
in the beds of numberless shallow brooks,
descended to the Grimsel Hospital, where he
passed
the night, and thought it the most lone and
desolate spot, that man ever slept in.
On the morrow, he rose with the day; and the
rising sun found him already standing on the
rustic
bridge, which hangs over the verge of the Falls
of the Aar at Handeck, where the river pitches
down a precipice into a narrow and fearful abyss,
shut in by perpendicular cliffs. At right angles
with it comes the beautiful Aerlenbach; and
halfway
down the double cascade mingles into one.
Thus he pursued his way down the Hasli Thal
into
the Bernese Oberland, restless, impatient, he
knew not why, stopping seldom, and never long,
and then rushing forward again, like the rushing
river whose steps he followed, and in whose
ice-cold
waters ever and anon he bathed his wrists, to
cool the fever in his blood; for the noonday sun
was hot.
His heart dilated in the dilating valley, that
grew broader and greener at every step. The
sight of human faces and human dwellings soothed
him; and through the fields of summer grain, in
the broad meadows of Imgrund, he walked with a
heart that ached no more, but trembled only, as our
eyelids when we have done weeping. As he
climbed the opposite hill, which hems in this
romantic
valley, and, like a heavy yoke, chafes the
neck of the Aar, he believed the ancient tradition,
which says, that once the valley was a lake. From
the summit of the hill he looked southward upon
a beautiful landscape of gardens, and fields of
grain, and woodlands, and meadows, and the
ancient
castle of Resti, looking down upon
Meyringen
.
And now all around him were the singing
of birds, and grateful shadows of the leafy trees;
and sheeted waterfalls dropping from the woodland
cliffs, seen only, but unheard, the fluted columns
breaking into mist, and fretted with frequent spires
and ornaments of foam, and not unlike the towers
of a Gothic church inverted. There, in one white
sheet of foam, the Riechenbach pours down into
its deep beaker, into which the sun never shines.
Face to face it beholds the Alpbach falling from the
opposite hill, like a downward smoke. When
Flemming saw the innumerable runnels, sliding
down the mountain-side, and leaping, all life and
gladness, he would fain have clasped them in his
arms and been their playmate, and revelled with
them in their freedom and delight. Yet he was
weary with the day's journey, and entered the
village
of Meyringen, embowered in cherry-trees,
which were then laden with fruit, more like a
way-worn
traveller than an enthusiastic poet. As he
went up the tavern steps he said in his heart, with
the Italian Aretino; He who has not been at a
tavern, knows not what a paradise it is. O holy
tavern! O miraculous tavern! holy, because no
carking cares are there, nor weariness, nor pain;
and miraculous, because of the spits, which of
themselves turn round and round! Of a truth all
courtesy and good manners come from taverns, so
full of bows, and
Signor, s!
and
Signor, n!
But even in the tavern he could not rest long.
The same evening at sunset he was floating on the
lake of Brienz, in an open boat, close under the
cascade of the Giessbach, hearing the peasants
sing the Ranz des Vaches. He slept that night
at the other extremity of the lake, in a large
house, which, like Saint Peter's at Joppa, stood by
the water's side. The next day he wasted in
writing letters, musing in this green nest, and
paddling
about the lake again; and in the evening
went across the beautiful meadows to Interlachen,
where many things happened to him, and detained
him long.
CHAPTER III.
INTERLACHEN.
Interlachen!
How peacefully, by the margin
of the swift-rushing Aar, thou liest, on the broad
lap of those romantic meadows, all overshadowed
by the wide arms of giant trees! Only the round
towers of thine ancient cloister rise above their
summits; the round towers themselves, but a
child's playthings under the great church-towers
of the mountains. Close beside thee are lakes,
which the flowing band of the river ties together.
Before thee opens the magnificent valley of
Lauterbrunn
,
where the cloud-hooded Monk and pale
Virgin stand like Saint Francis and his Bride of
Snow; and all around thee are fields, and
orchards
,
and hamlets green, from which the
church-bells
answer each other at evening! The evening
sun was setting when I first beheld thee! The
sun of life will set ere I forget thee! Surely it
was a scene like this, that inspired the soul of the
Swiss poet, in his Song of the Bell!
Bell! thou soundest merrily,
When the bridal party
To the church doth hie!
Bell! thou soundest solemnly,
When, on Sabbath morning,
Fields deserted lie!
Bell! thou soundest merrily;
Tellest thou at evening,
Bed-time draweth nigh!
Bell! thou soundest mournfully;
Tellest thou the bitter
Parting hath gone by!
Say! how canst thou mourn?
How canst thou rejoice?
Art but metal dull!
And yet all our sorrowings,
And all our rejoicings,
Thou dost feel them all!
God hath wonders many,
Which we cannot fathom,
Placed within thy form!
When the heart is sinking,
Thou alone canst raise it,
Trembling in the storm!
Paul Flemming alighted at one of the principal
hotels. The landlord came out to meet him.
He had great eyes and a green coat; and
reminded
Flemming of the innkeeper mentioned in the
Golden Ass, who had been changed by magic into
a frog, and croaked to his customers from the lees
of a wine-cask. His house, he said, was full;
and so was every house in Interlachen; but, if the
gentleman would walk into the parlour, he would
procure a chamber for him, in the neighbourhood.
On the sofa sat a gentleman, reading; a stout
gentleman of perhaps forty-five, round, ruddy, and
with a head, which, being a little bald on the top,
looked not unlike a crow's nest, with one egg in it.
A good-humored face turned from the book as
Flemming entered; and a good-humored voice
exclaimed;
Ha! ha! Mr. Flemming! Is it you, or your
apparition! I told you we should meet again!
though you were for taking an eternal farewell of
your fellow-traveller.
Saying these words, the stout gentleman rose
and shook Flemming heartily by the hand. And
Flemming returned the shake as heartily,
recognising
in this ruddy personage, a former travelling
companion, Mr. Berkley, whom he had left, a
week or two previous, toiling up the Righi. Mr.
Berkley was an Englishman of fortune; a
good-humored
,
humane old bachelor; remarkable alike
for his common sense and his eccentricity. That
is to say, the basis of his character was good,
sound common sense, trodden down and
smoothed
by education; but this level groundwork his
strange and whimsical fancy used as a
dancing-floor
,
whereon to exhibit her eccentric tricks. His
ruling passion was cold-bathing; and he usually
ate his breakfast sitting in a tub of cold water, and
reading a newspaper. He kissed every child he
met; and to every old man, said in passing, God
VOL. II. 2
bless you! with such an expression of voice and
countenance, that no one could doubt his sincerity.
He reminded one of Roger Bontemps, or the
Little
Man in Gray; though with a difference.
The last time I had the pleasure of seeing
you, Mr. Berkley, said Flemming, was at
Goldau
,
just as you were going up the Righi. I
hope you were gratified with a fine sunrise on the
mountain top.
No, Sir, I was not! replied Mr. Berkley.
It is all a humbug! a confounded humbug!
They made such a noise about their sunrise, that
I determined I would not see it. So I lay snug
in bed; and only peeped through the window
curtain
.
That was enough. Just above the house,
on the top of the hill, stood some fifty half-dressed,
romantic individuals, shivering in the wet grass; and,
a short distance from them, a miserable wretch,
blowing a long, wooden horn. That's your
sunrise
on the Righi, is it? said I; and went to sleep
again. The best thing I saw at the Culm, was
the advertisement on the bed-room doors, saying,
that, if the ladies would wear the quilts and
blankets for shawls, when they went out to see the
sunrise, they must pay for the washing. Take
my word for it, the Righi is a great humbug!
Where have you been since?
At Zurich and Schaffhausen. If you go to
Zurich, beware how you stop at the Raven.
They will cheat you. They cheated me; but I
had my revenge, for, when we reached
Schaffhausen
,
I wrote in the Traveller's Book;
Beware of the Raven of Zurich!
'T is a bird of omen ill;
With a noisy and an unclean nest,
And a very, very long bill.
If you go to the Golden Falken you will find it
there. I am the author of those lines!
Bitter as Juvenal! exclaimed Flemming.
Not in the least bitter, said Mr. Berkley.
It is all true. Go to the Raven and see. But
this Interlachen! this Interlachen! It is the
loveliest
spot on the face of the earth, he continued,
stretching out both arms, as if to embrace the
object
of his affection. There,only look out
there!
Here he pointed to the window. Flemming
looked, and beheld a scene of transcendent beauty.
The plain was covered already by the brown shade
of the summer twilight. From the cottage roofs
in Unterseen rose here and there a thin column of
smoke over the tops of the trees and mingled with
the evening shadows. The Valley of
Lauterbrunnen
was filled with a blue haze. Far above,
in the clear, cloudless heaven, the white forehead
of the Jungfrau blushed at the last kiss of the
departing sun. It was a glorious Transfiguration
of Nature! And when the village bells began
to ring, and a single voice at a great distance
was heard
yodling
forth a ballad, it rather broke
than increased the enchantment of a scene, where
silence was more musical than sound.
For a long time they gazed at the gloaming
landscape, and spake not. At length people came
into the parlour, and laid aside their shawls and
hats, and exchanged a word or two with Berkley
To Flemming they were all unknown. To him it
was all Mr. Brown and Mrs. Johnson, and nothing
more. The conversation turned upon the various
excursions of the day. Some had been at the
Staubbach, others at the Grindelwald; others at
the Lake of Thun; and nobody before had ever
experienced half the rapture, which they had
experienced
that day. And thus they sat in the
twilight, as people love to do, at the close of a
summer day. As yet the lamps had not been
lighted; and one could not distinguish faces; but
voices only, and forms, like shadows.
Presently a female figure, clothed in black,
entered
the room and sat down by the window. She
rather listened to the conversation, than joined in
it; but the few words she said were spoken in a
voice so musical and full of soul, that it moved the
soul of Flemming, like a whisper from heaven.
O, how wonderful is the human voice! It is
indeed the organ of the soul! The intellect of
man sits enthroned visibly upon his forehead and
in his eye; and the heart of man is written upon
his countenance. But the soul reveals itself in
the voice only; as God revealed himself to the
prophet of old in the still, small voice; and in a
voice from the burning bush. The soul of man
is audible, not visible. A sound alone betrays
the flowing of the eternal fountain, invisible to
man!
Flemming would fain have sat and listened for
hours to the sound of that unknown voice. He
felt sure, in his secret heart, that the being from
whom it came was beautiful. His imagination
filled up the faint outline, which the eye beheld in
the fading twilight, and the figure stood already in
his mind, like Raphael's beautiful Madonna in the
Dresden gallery. He was never more mistaken
in his life. The voice belonged to a beautiful
being
,
it is true; but her beauty was different from
that of any Madonna which Raphael ever painted;
as he would have seen, had he waited till the
lamps were lighted. But in the midst of his
reverie
and saint-painting, the landlord came in, and
told him he had found a chamber, which he begged
him to go and look at.
Flemming took his leave and departed. Berkley
went with him, to see, he said, what kind of a nest
his young friend was to sleep in.
The chamber is not what I could wish, said
the landlord, as he led them across the street.
It is in the old cloister. But to-morrow or next
day, you can no doubt have a room at the house.
The name of the cloister struck Flemming's
imagination
pleasantly. He was owl enough to like
ruins and old chambers, where nuns or friars had
slept. And he said to Berkley;
So, you perceive, my nest is to be in a
cloister
.
It already makes me think of a bird's-nest
I once saw on an old tower of Heidelberg castle,
built in the jaws of a lion, which formerly served
as a spout. But pray tell me, who was that young
lady, with the soft voice?
What young lady with the soft voice?
The young lady in black, who sat by the
window.
O, she is the daughter of an English officer,
who died not long ago at Naples. She is passing
the summer here with her mother, for her health.
What is her name?
Ashburton.
Is she beautiful?
Not in the least; but very intellectual. A
woman of genius, I should say.
And now they had reached the walls of the
cloister, and passed under an arched gateway, and
close beneath the round towers, which Flemming
had already seen, rising with their cone-shaped
roofs above the trees, like tall tapers, with
extinguishers
upon them.
It is not so bad, as it looks, said the
landlord
,
knocking at a small door, in the main
building
.
The Bailiff lives in one part of it.
A servant girl, with a candle in her hand,
opened
the door, and conducted Flemming and
Berkley
to the chamber which had been engaged. It
was a large room on the lower floor, wainscoted
with pine, and unpainted. Three lofty and narrow
windows, with leaden lattices and small panes,
looked
southward towards the valley of Lauterbrunnen
and the mountains. In one corner was a large
square bed, with a tester and checked curtains. In
another, a huge stove of painted tiles, reaching
almost
to the ceiling. An old sofa, a few
high-backed
antique chairs, and a table, completed the
furniture of the room.
Thus Flemming took possession of his monkish
cell and dormitory. He ordered tea, and began to
feel at home. Berkley passed the evening with
him. On going away he said;
Good night! I leave you to the care of the
Virgin and all the Saints. If the ghost of any
old monk comes back after his prayer-book, my
compliments to him. If I were a younger man,
you certainly should see a ghost. Good night!
When he had departed, Flemming opened the
lattice of one of the windows. The moon had
risen
,
and silvered the dark outline of the nearest
hills; while, afar off, the snowy summits of the
Jungfrau and the Silver-Horn shone like a white
2*
cloud in the sky. Close beneath the windows
was a flower-garden; and the breath of the
summer
night came to him with dewy fragrance.
There was a grateful seclusion about the place.
He blessed the happy accident, which gave him
such a lodging, and fell asleep that night
thinking
of the nuns, who once had slept in the
same quiet cells; but neither wimpled nun nor
cowled monk appeared to him in his dreams; not
even the face of Mary Ashburton; nor did he hear
her voice.
CHAPTER IV.
THE EVENING AND THE MORNING STAR.
Old
Froissart tells us, in his Chronicles, that
when King Edward beheld the Countess of
Salisbury
at her castle gate, he thought he had never
seen before so noble nor so fair a lady; he was
stricken therewith to the heart with a sparkle of
fine love, that endured long after; he thought no
lady in the world so worthy to be beloved, as she.
And so likewise thought Paul Flemming, when he
beheld the English lady in the fair light of a
summer morning. I will not disguise the truth.
She is my heroine; and I mean to describe her
with great truth and beauty, so that all shall be in
love with her, and I most of all.
Mary Ashburton was in her twentieth summer.
Like the fair maiden Amoret, she was sitting in
the lap of womanhood. They did her wrong,
who said she was not beautiful; and yet
she was not fair,
Nor beautiful;those words express her not.
But O, her looks had something excellent,
That wants a name!
Her face had a wonderful fascination in it. It
was such a calm, quiet face, with the light of the
rising soul shining so peacefully through it. At
times it wore an expression of seriousness,of
sorrow even; and then seemed to make the very
air bright with what the Italian poets so
beautifully
call the
lampeggiar dell' angelico riso,
the lightning of the angelic smile.
And O, those eyes,those deep, unutterable
eyes, with down-falling eyelids, full of dreams
and slumber, and within them a cold, living light,
as in mountain lakes at evening, or in the river of
Paradise, forever gliding,
with a brown, brown current
Under the shade perpetual, that never
Ray of the sun lets in, nor of the moon.
I dislike an eye that twinkles like a star. Those
only are beautiful which, like the planets, have a
steady, lambent light;are luminous, but not
sparkling. Such eyes the Greek poets give to the
Immortals. But I forget myself.
The lady's figure was striking. Every step,
every attitude was graceful, and yet lofty, as if
inspired by the soul within. Angels in the old
poetic philosophy have such forms; it was the
soul itself imprinted on the air. And what a soul
was hers! A temple dedicated to Heaven, and,
like the Pantheon at Rome, lighted only from
above. And earthly passions in the form of gods
were no longer there, but the sweet and thoughtful
faces of Christ, and the Virgin Mary, and the
Saints. Thus there was not one discordant thing
in her; but a perfect harmony of figure, and face,
and soul, in a word of the whole being. And he
who had a soul to comprehend hers, must of
necessity love her, and, having once loved her,
could love no other woman forevermore.
No wonder, then, that Flemming felt his heart
drawn towards her, as, in her morning walk, she
passed him, sitting alone under the great walnut
trees near the cloister, and thinking of Heaven,
but not of her. She, too, was alone. Her cheek
was no longer pale; but glowing and bright, with
the inspiration of the summer air. Flemming
gazed after her till she disappeared, even as a
vision of his dreams, he knew not whither. He
was not yet in love, but very near it; for he
thanked God, that he had made such beautiful
beings to walk the earth.
Last night he had heard a voice to which his
soul responded; and he might have gone on his
way, and taken no farther heed. But he would
have heard that voice afterwards, whenever at
evening he thought of this evening at Interlachen.
To-day he had seen more clearly the vision, and
his restless soul calm. The place seemed
pleasant to him; and he could not go. He did
not ask himself whence came this calm. He felt
it; and was happy in the feeling; and blessed the
landscape and the summer morning, as if they
possessed the wonder-working power.
A pleasant morning dream to you; said a
friendly voice; and at the same moment some one
laid his hand upon Flemming's shoulder. It was
Berkley. He had approached unseen and
unheard
.
I see by the smile on your countenance, he
continued, that it is no day-incubus.
You are right, replied Flemming. It was
a pleasant dream, which you have put to flight.
And I am glad to see, that you have also put
to flight the gloomy thoughts which used to haunt
you. I like to see people cheerful and happy.
What is the use of giving way to sadness in this
beautiful world?
Ah! this beautiful world! said Flemming,
with a smile. Indeed, I know not what to think
of it. Sometimes it is all gladness and sunshine,
and Heaven itself lies not far off. And then it
changes suddenly; and is dark and sorrowful, and
clouds shut out the sky. In the lives of the
saddest
of us, there are bright days like this, when
we feel as if we could take the great world in our
arms and kiss it. Then come the gloomy hours,
when the fire will neither burn on our hearths nor
in our hearts; and all without and within is
dismal
,
cold, and dark. Believe me, every heart has
its secret sorrows, which the world knows not,
and oftentimes we call a man cold, when he is
only sad.
And who says we don't? interrupted
Berkley
.
Come, come! Let us go to breakfast.
The morning air has given me a rude appetite. I
long to say grace over a fresh egg; and eat salt
with my worst enemies; namely, the Cockneys at
the hotel. After breakfast you must give
yourself
up wholly to me. I shall take you to the
Grindelwald!
To-day, then, you do not breakfast like
Diogenes
,
but consent to leave your tub.
Yes, for the pleasure of your company. I
shall also blow out the light in my lantern, having
found you.
Thank you.
The breakfast passed without any unusual
occurrence
.
Flemming watched the entrance of
every guest; but she came not,the guest he
most desired to see.
And now for the Grindelwald! said Berkley.
Why such haste? We have the whole day
before us. There is time enough.
Not a moment to loso, I assure you. The
carriage is at the door.
They drove up the valley of Lauterbrunnen, and
turned eastward among the mountains of the
Grindelwald. There they passed the day;
half-frozen
by the icy breath of the Great Glacier,
upon whose surface stand pyramids and blocks of
ice, like the tombstones of a cemetery. It was a
weary day to Flemming. He wished himself at
Interlachen; and was glad when, towards evening,
he saw once more the cone-roofed towers of the
cloister rising above the walnut trees.
That evening is written in red letters in his
history. It gave him another revelation of the
beauty and excellence of the female character and
intellect; not wholly new to him, yet now
renewed
and fortified. It was from the lips of Mary
Ashburton, that the revelation came. Her form
arose, like a tremulous evening star, in the
firmament
of his soul. He conversed with her; and
with her alone; and knew not when to go. All
others were to him as if they were not there. He
saw their forms, but saw them as the forms of
inanimate
things. At length her mother came; and
Flemming beheld in her but another Mary
Ashburton
,
with beauty more mature;the same
forehead
and eyes, the same majestic figure; and, as
yet, no trace of age. He gazed upon her with a
feeling of delight, not unmingled with holy awe.
She was to him the rich and glowing Evening,
from whose bosom the tremulous star was born.
Berkley took no active part in the conversation,
but did what was much more to the purpose, that
it is to say, arranged a drive for the next day with
the Ashburtons, and of course invited Flemming,
who went home that night with a halo round his
head; and wondering much at a dandy, who stood
at the door of the hotel, and said to his
companion
,
as Flemming passed;
What do you call this place? I have been
here two hours already, and find it devilish dull!
CHAPTER V.
A RAINY DAY.
When
Flemming awoke the next morning he
saw the sky dark and lowering. From the
mountain
tops hung a curtain of mist, whose heavy folds
waved to and fro in the valley below. Over all
the landscape, the soft, summer rain was falling.
No admiring eyes would look up that day at the
Staubbach.
A rainy day in Switzerland puts a sudden stop
to many diversions. The coachman may drive to
the tavern and then back to the stable; but no
farther. The sunburnt guide may sit at the
ale-house
door, and welcome; and the boatman
whistle
and curse the clouds, at his own sweet will;
but no foot stirs abroad for all that; no traveller
moves, if he has time to stay. The rainy day
gives him time for reflection. He has leisure now
to take cognizance of his impressions, and make
up his account with the mountains. He
remembers
,
too, that he has friends at home; and writes
up the Journal, neglected for a week or more;
and letters neglected longer; or finishes the rough
pencil-sketch, begun yesterday in the open air.
On the whole he is not sorry it rains; though
disappointed
.
Flemming was both sorry and disappointed;
but he did not on that account fail to go over to
the Ashburtons at the appointed hour. He found
them sitting in the parlour. The mother was
reading, and the daughter retouching a sketch of
the Lake of Thun. After the usual salutations,
Flemming seated himself near the daughter, and
said;
We shall have no Staubbach to-day, I
presume
;
only this Giessbach from the clouds.
Nothing more, I suppose. So we must be
content to stay in-doors; and listen to the sound
of the eves-dropping rain. It gives me time to
finish some of these rough sketches.
It is a pleasant pastime, said Flemming;
and I perceive you are very skilful. I am
delighted
to see, that you can draw a straight line. I
never
before saw a lady's sketch-book, in which all the
towers did not resemble the leaning Tower of
Pisa. I always tremble for the little men under
them.
How absurd! exclaimed Mary Ashburton,
with a smile that passed through the misty air of
Flemming's thoughts, like a sunbeam; For one,
I succeed much better in straight lines than in any
others. Here I have been trying a half-hour to
make this water-wheel round; and round it never
will be.
Then let it remain as it is. It looks
uncommonly
picturesque, and may pass for a new
invention
.
The lady continued to sketch, and Flemming to
gaze at her beautiful face; often repeating to
himself
those lines in Marlow's Faust;
O thou art fairer than the evening air,
Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars!
He certainly would have betrayed himself to
the maternal eye of Mrs. Ashburton, had she not
been wholly absorbed in the follies of a fashionable
novel. Ere long the fair sketcher had paused for
a moment; and Flemming had taken her
sketch-book
in his hands and was looking it through from
the beginning with ever-increasing delight, half of
which he dared not express, though he favored
her with some comments and bursts of admiration.
This is truly a very beautiful sketch of
Murten
and the battle-field! How quietly the
land-scape
sleeps there by the lake, after the battle!
Did you ever read the ballad of Veit Weber, the
shoe-maker, on this subject? He says, the routed
Burgundians jumped into the lake, and the Swiss
Leaguers shot them down like wild ducks among
the reeds. He fought in the battle and wrote the
ballad afterwards;
`He had himself laid hand on sword,
He who this rhyme did write;
Till evening mowed he with the sword,
And sang the song at night.'
You must give me the whole ballad, said Miss
Ashburton; it will serve to illustrate the sketch.
And the sketch to illustrate the ballad. And
now we suddenly slide down the Alps into Italy,
and are even in Rome, if I mistake not. This is
surely a head of Homer?
Yes, replied the lady, with a little
enthusiasm
.
Do you not remember the marble bust at
Rome? When I first beheld that bust, it
absolutely
inspired me with awe. It is not the face of
a man, but of a god!
And you have done it no injustice in your
copy, said Flemming, catching a new enthusiasm
from hers. With what a classic grace the fillet,
passing round the majestic forehead, confines his
flowing locks, which mingle with his beard! The
countenance, too, is calm, majestic, godlike! Even
the fixed and sightless eyeballs do not mar the
image
of the seer! Such were the sightless eyes of
the blind old man of Chios. They seem to look
with mournful solemnity into the mysterious future;
and the marble lips to repeat that prophetic
passage
in the Hymn to Apollo; `Let me also hope
to be remembered in ages to come. And when
any one, born of the tribes of men, comes hither,
a weary traveller, and inquires, who is the
sweetest
of the Singing Men, that resort to your feasts,
and whom you most delight to hear, do you make
answer for me. It is the Blind Man, who dwells
in Chios; his songs excel all that can ever be
sung!' But do you really believe, that this is a
portrait of Homer?
Certainly not! It is only an artist's dream.
It was thus, that Homer appeared to him in his
visions of the antique world. Every one, you
know, forms an image in his fancy of persons and
things he has never seen; and the artist
reproduces
them in marble or on canvass.
And what is the image in your fancy? Is it
like this?
VOL. II. 3
No; not entirely. I have drawn my
impressions
from another source. Whenever I think of
Homer, which is not often, he walks before me,
solemn and serene, as in the vision of the great
Italian; in countenance neither sorrowful nor glad,
followed by other bards, and holding in his right
hand a sword!
That is a finer conception, than even this,
said Flemming. And I perceive from your
words, as well as from this book, that you have a
true feeling for art, and understand what it is.
You have had bright glimpses into the enchanted
land.
I trust, replied the lady modestly, that I
am not wholly without this feeling. Certainly I
have as strong and passionate a love of Art as of
Nature.
But does it not often offend you to hear people
speaking of Art and Nature as opposite and
discordant
things? Surely nothing can be more false.
Nature is a revelation of God; Art a revelation of
man. Indeed, Art signifies no more than this.
Art is Power. That is the original meaning of the
word. It is the creative power by which the soul
of man makes itself known, through some
external
manifestation or outward sign. As we can
always
hear the voice of God, walking in the
garden
,
in the cool of the day, or under the star-light,
where, to quote one of this poet's verses, `high
prospects and the brows of all steep hills and
pinnacles
thrust up themselves for shows';so,
under the twilight and the starlight of past ages,
do we hear the voice of man, walking amid the
works of his hands, and city walls and towers and
the spires of churches, thrust up themselves for
shows.
The lady smiled at his warmth; and he
continued
;
This, however, is but a similitude; and Art
and Nature are more nearly allied than by
similitudes
only. Art is the revelation of man; and
not merely that, but likewise the revelation of
Nature
,
speaking through man. Art prexists in
Nature
,
and Nature is reproduced in Art. As vapors
from the ocean, floating landward and dissolved in
rain, are carried back in rivers to the ocean, so
thoughts and the semblances of things that fall
upon the soul of man in showers, flow out again
in living streams of Art, and lose themselves in
the great ocean, which is Nature. Art and
Nature
are not, then, discordant, but ever
harmoniously
working in each other.
Enthusiasm begets enthusiasm. Flemming spake
with such evident interest in the subject, that Miss
Ashburton did not fail to manifest some interest
in what he said; and, encouraged by this, he
proceeded
;
Thus in this wondrous world wherein we live,
which is the World of Nature, man has made
unto himself another world hardly less wondrous,
which is the World of Art. And it lies infolded
and compassed about by the other,
`And the clear region where 't was born,
Round in itself incloses.'
Taking this view of art, I think we understand
more easily the skill of the artist, and the
difference
between him and the mere amateur. What
we call miracles and wonders of art are not so to
him who created them. For they were created
by the natural movements of his own great soul.
Statues, paintings, churches, poems, are but
shadows
of himself;shadows in marble, colors,
stone, words. He feels and recognises their
beauty
;
but he thought these thoughts and produced
these things as easily as inferior minds do thoughts
and things inferior. Perhaps more easily. Vague
images and shapes of beauty floating through the
soul, the semblances of things as yet indefinite or
ill-defined, and perfect only when put in art,this
Possible Intellect, as the Scholastic Philosophers
have termed it,the artist shares in common with
us all. The lovers of art are many. But the
Active
Intellect, the creative power,the power to
put these shapes and images in art, to imbody the
indefinite, and render perfect, is his alone. He
shares the gift with few. He knows not even
whence nor how this is. He knows only that it
is; that God has given him the power, which
has been denied to others.
I should have known you were just from
Germany
,
said the lady, with a smile, even if you
had not told me so. You are an enthusiast for the
Germans. For my part I cannot endure their
harsh language.
You would like it better, if you knew it
better
,
answered Flemming. It is not harsh to
me; but homelike, hearty, and full of feeling, like
the sound of happy voices at a fireside, of a
winter's
night, when the wind blows, and the fire
crackles, and hisses, and snaps. I do indeed love
the Germans; the men are so hale and hearty,
and the Fruleins so tender and true!
I always think of men with pipes and beer,
and women with knittingwork.
O, those are English prejudices, exclaimed
Flemming. Nothing can be more
And their very literature presents itself to my
imagination under the same forms.
I see you have read only English criticisms;
and have an idea, that all German books smell, as
it were, `of groceries, of brown papers, filled with
greasy cakes and slices of bacon; and of fryings in
frowzy back-parlours; and this shuts you out from
a glorious world of poetry, romance, and dreams!
Mary Ashburton smiled, and Flemming
continued
to turn over the leaves of the sketch-book,
with an occasional criticism and witticism. At
length he came to a leaf which was written in
pencil. People of a lively imagination are
generally
curious, and always so when a little in love.
Here is a pencil-sketch, said he, with an
entreating
look, which I would fain examine with
the rest.
You may do so, if you wish; but you will
find it the poorest sketch in the book. I was
trying
one day to draw the picture of an artist's life
in Rome, as it presented itself to my imagination;
and this is the result. Perhaps it may awaken
some pleasant recollection in your mind.
Flemming waited no longer; but read with the
eyes of a lover, not of a critic, the following
description
,
which inspired him with a new
enthusiasm
for Art, and for Mary Ashburton.
I often reflect with delight upon the young
artist's life in Rome. A stranger from the cold
and gloomy North, he has crossed the Alps, and
with the devotion of a pilgrim journeyed to the
Eternal City. He dwells perhaps upon the
Pincian
Hill; and hardly a house there, which is not
inhabited by artists from foreign lands. The very
room he lives in has been their abode from time
out of mind. Their names are written all over
the walls; perhaps some further record of them
left in a rough sketch upon the window-shutter,
with an inscription and a date. These things
consecrate
the place, in his imagination. Even
these names, though unknown to him, are not
without associations in his mind.
In that warm latitude he rises with the day.
The night-vapors are already rolling away over
the Campagna sea-ward. As he looks from his
window, above and beyond their white folds he
recognises the tremulous blue sea at Ostia. Over
Soracte rises the sun,over his own beloved
mountain; though no longer worshipped there, as
of old. Before him, the antique house, where
Raphael lived, casts its long, brown shadow down
into the heart of modern Rome. The city lies still
asleep and silent. But above its dark roofs, more
than two hundred steeples catch the sunshine on
their gilded weather-cocks. Presently the bells
begin
to ring, and, as the artist listens to their pleasant
chimes, he knows that in each of those churches
over the high altar, hangs a painting by some great
master's hand, whose beauty comes between him
and heaven, so that he cannot pray, but wonder
only.
Among these works of art he passes the day;
but oftenest in St. Peter's and the Vatican. Up
the vast marble stair-case,through the Corridor
Chiaramonti,through vestibules, galleries,
chambers
,he
passes, as in a dream. All are filled
with busts and statues; or painted in daring
frescoes. What forms of strength and beauty!
what glorious creations of the human mind! and
in that last chamber of all, standing alone upon his
pedestal, the Apollo found at Actium,in such a
3*
majestic attitude,with such a noble
countenance
,
life-like, god-like!
Or perhaps he passes into the chambers of the
painters; but goes no further than the second.
For in the middle of that chamber a large
painting
stands upon the heavy easel, as if unfinished,
though more than three hundred years ago the
great artist completed it, and then laid his pencil
away forever, leaving this last benediction to the
world. It is the Transfiguration of Christ by
Raphael
.
A child looks not at the stars with greater
wonder, than the artist at this painting. He knows
how many studious years are in that picture. He
knows the difficult path that leads to perfection,
having himself taken some of the first steps.
Thus he recalls the hour, when that broad
canvass
was first stretched upon its frame, and
Raphael
stood before it, and laid the first colors upon it,
and beheld the figures one by one born into life,
and `looked upon the work of his own hands with
a smile, that it should have succeeded so well.'
He recalls too, the hour, when, the task
accomplished
,
the pencil dropped from the master's
dying
hand, and his eyes closed to open on a more
glorious transfiguration, and at length the dead
Raphael
lay in his own studio, before this wonderful
painting, more glorious than any conqueror under
the banners and armorial hatchments of his
funeral
!
Think you, that such sights and thoughts as
these do not move the heart of a young man and
an artist! And when he goes forth into the open
air, the sun is going down, and the gray ruins of
an antique world receive him. From the Palace
of the Csars he looks down into the Forum, or
towards the Coliseum; or westward sees the last
sunshine strike the bronze Archangel, which stands
upon the Tomb of Adrian. He walks amid a
world of Art in ruins. The very street-lamps,
that light him homeward, burn before some
painted
or sculptured image of the Madonna! What
wonder is it, if dreams visit him in his sleep,
nay, if his whole life seem to him a dream! What
wonder, if, with a feverish heart and quick hand,
he strive to reproduce those dreams in marble or
on canvass.
Foolish Paul Flemming! who both admired
and praised this little sketch, and yet was too blind
to see, that it was written from the heart, and not
from the imagination! Foolish Paul Flemming!
who thought, that a girl of twenty could write
thus, without a reason! Close upon this followed
another pencil sketch, which he likewise read, with
the lady's permission. It was this.
The whole period of the Middle Ages seems
very strange to me. At times I cannot persuade
myself that such things could have been, as history
tells us; that such a strange world was a part of
our world,that such a strange life was a part
of the life, which seems to us who are living it
now, so passionless and commonplace. It is only
when I stand amid ruined castles, that look at me
so mournfully, and behold the heavy armour of
old knights, hanging upon the wainscot of Gothic
chambers; or when I walk amid the aisles of
some dusky minster, whose walls are narrative of
hoar antiquity, and whose very bells have been
baptized, and see the carved oaken stalls in the
choir, where so many generations of monks have
sat and sung, and the tombs, where now they sleep
in silence, to awake no more to their midnight
psalms;it is only at such times, that the
history
of the Middle Ages is a reality to me, and
not a passage in romance.
Likewise the illuminated manuscripts of those
ages have something of this power of making the
dead Past a living Present in my mind. What
curious figures are emblazoned on the creaking
parchment, making its yellow leaves laugh with
gay colors! You seem to come upon them
unawares
.
Their faces have an expression of
wonder
.
They seem all to be just startled from their
sleep by the sound you made when you unloosed
the brazen clasps, and opened the curiously-carved
oaken covers, that turn on hinges, like the great
gates of a city. To the building of that city some
diligent monk gave the whole of a long life. With
what strange denizens he peopled it! Adam and
Eve standing under a tree, she, with the apple in
her hand;the patriarch Abraham, with a tree
growing out of his body, and his descendants
sitting
owl-like upon its branches;ladies with
flowing locks of gold; knights in armour, with
most fantastic, long-toed shoes; jousts and
tournaments
;
and Minnesingers, and lovers, whose heads
reach to the towers, where their ladies sit;
and all so angular, so simple, so childlike,all in
such simple attitudes, with such great eyes, and
holding up such long, lank fingers!These things
are characteristic of the Middle Ages, and
persuade
me of the truth of history.
At this moment Berkley entered, with a Swiss
cottage, which he had just bought as a present for
somebody's child in England; and a cane with a
chamois-horn on the end of it, which he had just
bought for himself. This was the first time,
that Flemming had been sorry to see the
good-natured
man. His presence interrupted the
delightful
conversation he was carrying on under
four eyes, with Mary Ashburton. He really
thought Berkley a bore, and wondered it had
never occurred to him before. Mrs. Ashburton,
too, must needs lay down her book; and the
conversation
became general. Strange to say, the
Swiss dinner-hour of one o'clock, did not come a
moment too soon for Flemming. It did not even
occur to him that it was early; for he was seated
beside Mary Ashburton, and at dinner one can
say so much, without being overheard.
CHAPTER VI.
AFTER DINNER, AND AFTER THE MANNER OF
THE BEST CRITICS.
When
the learned Thomas Diafoirus wooed
the fair Anglique, he drew from his pocket a
medical thesis, and presented it to her, as the
first-fruits of his genius; and at the same time,
invited her, with her father's permission, to attend
the dissection of a woman, upon whom he was to
lecture. Paul Flemming did nearly the same
thing; and so often, that it had become a habit.
He was continually drawing, from his pocket or his
memory, some scrap of song or story; and inviting
some fair Anglique, either with her father's
permission
or without, to attend the dissection of an
author, upon whom he was to discourse. He
soon gave proofs of this to Mary Ashburton.
What books have we here for afternoon
reading
?
said Flemming, taking a volume from the
parlour table, when they had returned from the
dining-room. O, it is Uhland's Poems. Have
you read any thing of his? He and Tieck are
the best living poets of Germany. They dispute
the palm of superiority. Let me give you a
lesson
in German, this afternoon, Miss Ashburton;
so that no one may accuse you of `omitting the
sweet benefit of time, to clothe your age with
angel-like perfection.' I have opened at random
upon the ballad of the Black Knight. You
repeat
the German after me, and I will translate to
you.
Pfingsten war, das Fest der Freude!
I should never persuade my unwilling lips to
pronounce such sounds. So I beg you not to
perplex me with your German, but read me the
ballad in English.
Well, then, listen. I will improvise a
translation
for your own particular benefit.
'T was
Pentecost, the Feast of Gladness,
When woods and fields put off all sadness.
Thus began the King and spake;
`So from the halls
Of ancient Hofburg's walls,
A luxuriant Spring shall break.'
Drums and trumpets echo loudly,
Wave the crimson banners proudly.
From balcony the King looked on;
In the play of spears,
Fell all the cavaliers,
Before the monarch's stalwart son.
To the barrier of the fight,
Rode at last a sable Knight.
`Sir Knight! your name and scutcheon, say!'
`Should I speak it here,
Ye would stand aghast with fear;
Am a Prince of mighty sway!'
When he rode into the lists,
The arch of heaven grew black with mists,
And the castle 'gan to rock.
At the first blow,
Fell the youth from saddle-bow,
Hardly rises from the shock.
Pipe and viol call the dances,
Torch-light through the high halls glances;
Waves a mighty shadow in.
With manner bland
Doth ask the maiden's hand,
Doth with her the dance begin.
Danced in sable iron sark,
Danced a measure weird and dark,
Coldly clasped her limbs around.
From breast and hair
Down fall from her the fair
Flowerets wilted to the ground.
To the sumptuous banquet came
Every Knight and every Dame.
'Twixt son and daughter all distraught,
With mournful mind
The ancient King reclined,
Gazed at them in silent thought.
Pale the children both did look,
But the guest a beaker took;
`Golden wine will make you whole!
The children drank,
Gave many a courteous thank;
`O that draught was very cool!'
Each the father's breast embraces,
Son and daughter; and their faces
Colorless grow utterly.
Whichever way
Looks the fear-struck father gray,
He beholds his children die.
`Woe! the blessed children both,
Takest thou in the joy of youth;
Take me, too, the joyless father!'
Spake the Grim Guest,
From his hollow, cavernous breast;
`Roses in the spring I gather!'
That is indeed a striking ballad! said Miss
Ashburton, but rather too grim and ghostly for
this dull afternoon.
It begins joyously enough with the feast of
Pentecost, and the crimson banners at the old
castle. Then the contrast is well managed.
The Knight in black mail, and the waving
in of the mighty shadow in the dance, and the
dropping of the faded flowers, are all strikingly
presented to the imagination. However, it tells
its own story, and needs no explanation. Here is
something in a different vein, though still
melancholy
.
The Castle by the Sea. Shall I
read it?
Yes, if you like.
Flemming read;
Hast
thou seen that lordly castle,
That Castle by the Sea?
Golden and red above it
The clouds float gorgeously.
And fain it would stoop downward
To the mirrored wave below;
And fain it would soar upward
In the evening's crimson glow.
`Well have I seen that castle,
That Castle by the Sea,
And the moon above it standing,
And the mist rise solemnly.'
The winds and the waves of ocean,
Had they a merry chime?
Didst thou hear, from those lofty chambers,
The harp and the minstrel's rhyme?
`The winds and the waves of ocean,
They rested quietly,
But I heard on the gale a sound of wail,
And tears came to my eye.'
And sawest thou on the turrets
The King and his royal bride?
And the wave of their crimson mantles?
And the golden crown of pride?
Led they not forth in rapture
A beauteous maiden there?
Resplendent as the morning sun,
Beaming with golden hair?
`Well saw I the ancient parents,
Without the crown of pride;
They were moving slow, in weeds of woe,
No maiden was by their side!'
How do you like that?
It is very graceful, and pretty. But Uhland
seems to leave a great deal to his reader's
imagination
.
All his readers should be poets themselves,
or they will hardly comprehend him. I confess, I
hardly understand the passage where he speaks of
the castle's stooping downward to the mirrored
wave below, and then soaring upward into the
gleaming sky. I suppose, however, he wishes to
express the momentary illusion we experience at
beholding a perfect reflection of an old tower in
the sea, and look at it as if it were not a mere
shadow in the water; and yet the real tower rises
far above, and seems to float in the crimson
evening
clouds. Is that the meaning?
I should think it was. To me it is all a
beautiful cloud landscape, which I comprehend
and feel, and yet should find some difficulty
perhaps
in explaining.
And why need one always explain? Some
feelings are quite untranslatable. No language
has yet been found for them. They gleam upon
us beautifully through the dim twilight of fancy,
and yet, when we bring them close to us, and
hold them up to the light of reason, lose their
beauty, all at once; just as glow-worms, which
gleam with such a spiritual light in the shadows
of evening, when brought in where the candles
are lighted, are found to be only worms, like so
many others.
Very true. We ought sometimes to be
content
with feeling. Here, now, is an exquisite
piece, which soothes one like the fall of evening
shadows,like the dewy coolness of twilight
after
a sultry day. I shall not give you a bald
translation
of my own, because I have laid up in my
memory another, which, though not very literal,
equals the original in beauty. Observe how finely
it commences.
Many
a year is in its grave,
Since I crossed this restless wave;
And the evening, fair as ever,
Shines on ruin, rock, and river.
Then, in this same boat, beside,
Sat two comrades old and tried;
One with all a father's truth,
One with all the fire of youth.
One on earth in silence wrought,
And his grave in silence sought;
But the younger, brighter form
Passed in battle and in storm!
So, whene'er I turn my eye
Back upon the days gone by,
Saddening thoughts of friends come o'er me,
Friends, who closed their course before me.
Yet what binds us, friend to friend,
But that soul with soul can blend?
Soul-like were those hours of yore;
Let us walk in soul once more!
Take, O boatman, thrice thy fee;
Take,I give it willingly;
For, invisibly to thee,
Spirits twain have crossed with me!
O, that is beautiful,`beautiful
exceedingly
!'
Who translated it?
I do not know. I wish I could find him out.
It is certainly admirably done; though in the
measure of the original there is something like the
rocking motion of a boat, which is not preserved
in the translation.
And is Uhland always so soothing and
spiritual
?
Yes, he generally looks into the spirit-world.
VOL. II. 4
I am now trying to find here a little poem on the
Death of a Country Clergyman; in which he
introduces
a beautiful picture. But I cannot turn to
it. No matter. He describes the spirit of the
good old man, returning to earth on a bright
summer morning, and standing amid the golden
corn and the red and blue flowers, and mildly
greeting the reapers as of old. The idea is
beautiful
,
is it not?
Yes, very beautiful!
But there is nothing morbid in Uhland's mind.
He is always fresh and invigorating, like a breezy
morning. In this he differs entirely from such
writers
as Salis and Matthisson.
And who are they?
Two melancholy gentlemen to whom life was
only a Dismal Swamp, upon whose margin they
walked with cambric handkerchiefs in their hands,
sobbing and sighing, and making signals to Death,
to come and ferry them over the lake. And now
their spirits stand in the green fields of German
song, like two weeping-willows, bending over a
grave. To read their poems, is like wandering
through a village churchyard on a summer
evening
,
reading the inscription upon the grave-stones,
and recalling sweet images of the departed; while
above you,
`Hark! in the holy grove of palms,
Where the stream of life runs free,
Echoes, in the angels' psalms,
`Sister spirit! hail to thee!'
How musically those lines flow! Are they
Matthisson's!
Yes; and they do indeed flow musically. I
wish I had his poems here. I should like to read
to you his Elegy on the Ruins of an Ancient
Castle. It is an imitation of Gray's Elegy. You
have been at Baden-Baden?
Yes; last summer.
And have not forgotten
The old castle? Of course not. What a
magnificent ruin it is!
That is the scene of Matthisson's Poem, and
seems to have filled the melancholy bard with
more than wonted inspiration.
I should like very much to see the poem, I
remember that old ruin with so much delight.
I am sorry I have not a translation of it for
you. Instead of it I will give you a sweet and
mournful poem from Salis. It is called the Song
of the Silent Land.
Into
the Silent Land!
Ah! who shall lead us thither!
Clouds in the evening sky more darkly gather,
And shattered wrecks lie thicker on the strand.
Who leads us with a gentle hand,
Thither, oh, thither.
Into the Silent Land?
Into the Silent Land!
To you, ye boundless regions
Of all perfection! Tender morning-visions
Of beauteous souls! Eternity's own band!
Who in Life's battle firm doth stand,
Shall bear Hope's tender blossoms
Into the Silent Land!
O Land! O Land!
For all the broken-hearted
The mildest herald by our fate allotted,
Beckons, and with inverted torch doth stand
To lead us with a gentle hand
Into the land of the great departed,
Into the Silent Land!
Is not that a beautiful poem?
Mary Ashburton made no answer. She had
turned away to hide her tears. Flemming
wondered
,
that Berkley could say she was not
beautiful
.
Still he was rather pleased than offended at
it. He felt at that moment how sweet a thing it
would be to possess one, who should seem
beautiful
to him alone, and yet to him be more beautiful
than all the world beside! How bright the world
became to him at that thought! It was like one
of those paintings in which all the light streams
from the face of the Virgin. O, there is nothing
holier in this life of ours, than the first
consciousness
of love,the first fluttering of its silken
wings; the first rising sound and breath of that
wind, which is so soon to sweep through the soul,
to purify or to destroy!
Old histories tell us, that the great Emperor
Charlemagne stamped his edicts with the hilt of
his sword. The greater Emperor, Death, stamps
his with the blade; and they are signed and
executed
with the same stroke. Flemming received
that night a letter from Heidelberg, which told
him, that Emma of Ilmenau was dead. The fate
of this poor girl affected him deeply; and he said
in his heart;
Father in Heaven! Why was the lot of
this weak and erring child so hard! What had
she done, to be so tempted in her weakness, and
perish? Why didst thou suffer her gentle
affections
to lead her thus astray?
And, through the silence of the awful midnight,
the voice of an avalanche answered from the
distant
mountains, and seemed to say;
Peace! peace! Why dost thou question
God's providence!
CHAPTER VII.
TAKE CARE!
Fair
is the valley of Lauterbrunnen with its
green meadows and overhanging cliffs. The ruined
castle of Unspunnen stands like an armed warder
at the gate of the enchanted land. In calm
serenity
the snowy mountains rise beyond. Fairer
than the Rock of Balmarusa, you frowning
precipice
looks down upon us; and, from the topmost
cliff, the white pennon of the Brook of Dust
shimmers
and waves in the sunny air!
It was a bright, beautiful morning after
night-rain
.
Every dewdrop and raindrop had a whole
heaven within it; and so had the heart of Paul
Flemming, as, with Mrs. Ashburton and her
dark-eyed
daughter, he drove up the Valley of
Lauter-brunnen
,the
Valley of Fountains-Only.
How beautiful the Jungfrau looks this
morning
!
exclaimed he, looking at Mary Ashburton.
She thought he meant the mountain, and
assented
.
But he meant her likewise.
And the mountains, beyond, he continued;
the Monk and the Silver-horn, the Wetter-horn
the Schreck-horn, and the Schwarz-horn, all those
sublime apostles of Nature, whose sermons are
avalanches! Did you ever behold anything more
grand!
O yes. Mont Blanc is more grand, when
you behold it from the hills opposite. It was there
that I was most moved by the magnificence of
Swiss scenery. It was a morning like this; and
the clouds, that were hovering about on their huge,
shadowy wings, made the scene only the more
magnificent
.
Before me lay the whole panorama of
the Alps; pine forests standing dark and solemn at
the base of the mountains; and half-way up a veil
of mist; above which rose the snowy summits,
and sharp needles of rock, which seemed to float
in the air, like a fairy world. Then the glaciers
stood on either side, winding down through the
mountain ravines; and, high above all, rose the
white, dome-like summit of Mont Blanc. And
ever and anon from the shroud of mist came the
awful sound of an avalanche, and a continual roar,
as of the wind through a forest of pines, filled the
air. It was the roar of the Arve and Aveiron,
breaking from their icy fountains. Then the mists
began to pass away; and it seemed as if the whole
firmament were rolling together. It recalled to
my mind that sublime passage in the Apocalypse;
`I saw a great white throne; and him that sat
thereon
;
before whose face the heavens and the earth
fled away, and found no place!' O, I cannot
believe
that upon this earth there is a more
magnificent
scene.
It must be grand, indeed, replied Flemming.
And those mighty glaciers,huge monsters with
bristling crests, creeping down into the valley! for
it is said they really move.
Yes; it filled me with a strange sensation of
awe to think of this. They seemed to me like
4 *
the dragons of Northern Romance, which come
down from the mountains and devour whole
villages
.
A little hamlet in Chamouni was once
abandoned by its inhabitants, terrified at the
approach
of the icy dragon. But is it possible you
have never been at Chamouni?
Never. The great marvel still remains
unseen
by me.
Then how can you linger here so long? Were
I in your place I would not lose an hour.
These words passed over the opening blossoms
of hope in the soul of Flemming, like a cold wind
over the flowers in spring-time. He bore it as best
he could, and changed the subject.
I do not mean to describe the Valley of
Lauterbrunnen
,
nor the bright day passed there. I know
that my gentle reader is blessed with the divine
gift of a poetic fancy; and can see already how
the mountains rise, and the torrents fall, and the
sweet valley lies between; and how, along the
dusty
road, the herdsman blows his horn, and
travellers
come and go in
charabans,
like Punch and
Judy in a show-box. He knows already how
romantic
ladies sketch romantic scenes; while
sweet gentlemen gather sweet flowers; and how
cold meat tastes under the shadow of trees, and
how time flies when we are in love, and the
beloved
one near. One little incident I must,
however
,
mention, lest his fancy should not suggest it.
Flemming was still sitting with the ladies, on
the green slope near the Staubbach, or Brook of
Dust, when a young man clad in green, came
down the valley. It was a German student, with
flaxen ringlets hanging over his shoulders, and a
guitar in his hand. His step was free and elastic,
and his countenance wore the joyous expression of
youth and health. He approached the company
with a courteous salutation; and, after the manner
of travelling students, asked charity with the
confident
air of one unaccustomed to refusal. Nor
was he refused in this instance. The presence of
those we love makes us compassionate and
generous
.
Flemming gave him a piece of gold; and
after a short conversation he seated himself, at a
little distance on the grass, and began to play and
sing. Wonderful and many were the sweet
accords
and plaintive sounds that came from that
little
instrument, touched by the student's hand.
Every feeling of the human heart seemed to find
an expression there, and awaken a kindred feeling
in the hearts of those who heard him. He sang
sweet German songs, so full of longing, and of
pleasing sadness, and hope and fear, and
passionate
desire, and soul-subduing sorrow, that the tears
came into Mary Ashburton's eyes, though she
understood
not the words he sang. Then his
countenance
glowed with triumph, and he beat the
strings like a drum, and sang;
O, how the drum beats so loud!
Close beside me in the fight,
My dying brother says, Good Night!
And the cannon's awful breath
Screams the loud halloo of Death!
And the drum,
And the drum,
Beats so loud!
Many were the words of praise, when the young
musician ended; and, as he rose to depart, they
still entreated for one song more. Whereupon he
played a lively prelude; and, looking full into
Flemming's face, sang with a pleasant smile, and
still in German, this little song.
I KNOW a maiden fair to see,
Take care!
She can both false and friendly be,
Beware! Beware!
Trust her not,
She is fooling thee!
She has two eyes, so soft and brown,
Take care!
She gives a side-glance and looks down,
Beware! Beware!
Trust her not,
She is fooling thee!
And she has hair of a golden hue,
Take care!
And what she says, it is not true,
Beware! Beware!
Trust her not,
She is fooling thee!
She has a bosom as white as snow,
Take care!
She knows how much it is best to show,
Beware! Beware!
Trust her not,
She is fooling thee!
She gives thee a garland woven fair,
Take care!
It is a fool's cap for thee to wear,
Beware! Beware!
Trust her not,
She is fooling thee!
The last stanza he sung in a laughing,
triumphant
tone, which resounded above the loud clang
of his guitar, like the jeering laugh of Till
Eulenspiegel
.
Then slinging his guitar over his
shoulder, he took off his green cap, and made a
leg to the ladies, in the style of Gil Blas; waved
his hand in the air, and walked quickly down the
valley, singing Ad! Ad! Ad!
CHAPTER VIII.
THE FOUNTAIN OF OBLIVION.
The
power of magic in the Middle Ages
created
monsters, who followed the unhappy magician
everywhere. The power of Love in all ages
creates angels, who likewise follow the happy or
unhappy lover everywhere, even in his dreams.
By such an angel was Paul Flemming now
haunted
,
both when he waked and when he slept. He
walked as in a dream; and was hardly conscious
of the presence of those around him. A sweet
face looked at him from every page of every book
he read; and it was the face of Mary Ashburton!
a sweet voice spake to him in every sound he
heard; and it was the voice of Mary Ashburton!
Day and night succeeded each other, with pleasant
interchange of light and darkness; but to him the
passing of time was only as a dream. When he
arose in the morning, he thought only of her, and
wondered if she were yet awake; and when he
lay down at night he thought only of her, and
how, like the Lady Christabel,
Her gentle limbs she did undress,
And lay down in her loveliness.
And the livelong day he was with her, either in
reality or in day-dreams, hardly less real; for, in
each delirious vision of his waking hours, her
beauteous
form passed like the form of Beatrice through
Dante's heaven; and, as he lay in the summer
afternoon
,
and heard at times the sound of the wind
in the trees, and the sound of Sabbath bells
ascending
up to heaven, holy wishes and prayers
ascended
with them from his inmost soul, beseeching
that he might not love in vain! And whenever, in
silence and alone, he looked into the silent, lonely
countenance of Night, he recalled the impassioned
lines of Plato;
Lookest thou at the stars? If I were heaven,
With all the eyes of heaven would I look down on thee!
O how beautiful it is to love! Even thou, that
sneerest at this page, and laughest in cold
indifference
or scorn if others are near thee, thou, too,
must acknowledge its truth when thou art alone;
and confess, that a foolish world is prone to laugh
in public, at what in private it reverences, as one
of the highest impulses of our nature,namely,
Love!
One by one the objects of our affection depart
from us. But our affections remain, and like vines
stretch forth their broken, wounded tendrils for
support. The bleeding heart needs a balm to heal
it; and there is none but the love of its kind,
none but the affection of a human heart! Thus
the wounded, broken affections of Flemming
began
to lift themselves from the dust and cling
around this new object. Days and weeks passed;
and, like the Student Crisostomo, he ceased to love
because he began to adore. And with this
adoration
mingled the prayer, that, in that hour when
the world is still, and the voices that praise are
mute, and reflection cometh like twilight, and the
maiden, in her day-dreams, counted the number of
her friends, some voice in the sacred silence of her
thoughts might whisper his name! And was it
indeed so? Did any voice in the sacred silence of
her thoughts whisper his name?We shall soon
learn.
They were sitting together one morning, on the
green, flowery meadow, under the ruins of Burg
Unspunnen. She was sketching the ruins. The
birds were singing one and all, as if there were no
aching hearts, no sin nor sorrow, in the world. So
motionless was the bright air, that the shadow of
the trees lay engraven on the grass. The distant
snow-peaks sparkled in the sun, and nothing
frowned
,
save the square tower of the old ruin above
them.
What a pity it is, said the lady, as she
stopped
to rest her weary fingers; what a pity it is,
that there is no old tradition connected with this
ruin.
I will make you one, if you wish, said
Flemming.
Can you make old traditions?
O yes; I made three the other day for the
Rhine, and one very old one for the Black Forest.
A lady with dishevelled hair; a robber with a
horrible
slouched hat; and a night-storm among the
roaring pines.
Delightful! Do make one for me.
With the greatest pleasure. Where will you
have the scene? Here, or in the Black Forest?
In the Black Forest, by all means? Begin.
First promise not to interrupt me. If you
snap the golden threads of thought, they will float
away on the air like gossamer threads, and I shall
never be able to recover them.
I promise.
Listen, then, to the Tradition of `
The
Fountain
of Oblivion
.'
Begin.
Flemming was reclining on the flowery turf,
at the lady's feet, looking up with dreamy eyes
into her sweet face, and then into the leaves of
the linden-trees overhead.
Gentle Lady! Dost thou remember the
linden-trees of Blach, those tall and stately
trees, with velvet down upon their shining leaves
and rustic benches underneath their overhanging
eaves! A leafy dwelling, fit to be the home of
elf or fairy, where first I told my love to thee,
thou cold and stately Hermione! A little peasant
girl stood near, and listened all the while, with
eyes of wonder and delight, and an unconscious
smile, to hear the stranger still speak on in accents
deep yet mild,none else was with us in that
hour, save God and that peasant child!
Why, it is in rhyme!
No, no! the rhyme is only in your
imagination
.
You promised not to interrupt me, and you
have already snapped asunder the gossamer threads
of as sweet a dream as was ever spun from a
poet's brain.
It certainly did rhyme!
This was the reverie of the Student
Hieronymus
,
as he sat at midnight in his chamber, with
his hands clasped together, and resting upon an
open volume, which he should have been reading.
His pale face was raised, and the pupils of his
eyes dilated as if the spirit-world were open
before
him, and some beauteous vision were standing
there, and drawing the student's soul through his
eyes up into Heaven, as the evening sun through
parting summer-clouds, seems to draw into its
bosom the vapors of the earth. O, it was a sweet
vision! I can see it before me now!
Near the student stood an antique bronze
lamp, with strange figures carved upon it. It
was a magic lamp, which once belonged to the
Arabian astrologer El Geber, in Spain. Its light
was beautiful as the light of stars; and, night after
night, as the lonely wight sat alone and read in
his lofty tower, through the mist, and mirk, and
dropping rain, it streamed out into the darkness,
and was seen by many wakeful eyes. To the
poor Student Hieronymus it was a wonderful
Aladdin's
Lamp; for in its flame a Divinity revealed
herself unto him, and showed him treasures.
Whenever he opened a ponderous, antiquated
tome, it seemed as if some angel opened for him
the gates of Paradise; and already he was known
in the city as Hieronymus the Learned.
But, alas! he could read no more. The
charm was broken. Hour after hour he passed
with his hands clasped before him, and his fair
eyes gazing at vacancy. What could so disturb
the studies of this melancholy wight? Lady, he
was in love! Have you ever been in love? He
had seen the face of the beautiful Hermione;
and as, when we have thoughtlessly looked at
the sun, our dazzled eyes, though closed, behold
it still; so he beheld by day and by night the
radiant image of her upon whom he had too rashly
gazed. Alas! he was unhappy; for the proud
Hermione disdained the love of a poor student,
whose only wealth was a magic lamp. In marble
halls, and amid the gay crowd that worshipped
her, she had almost forgotten that such a being
lived as the Student Hieronymus. The adoration
of his heart had been to her only as the perfume
of a wild flower, which she had carelessly crushed
with her foot in passing. But he had lost all; for
he had lost the quiet of his thoughts; and his
agitated soul reflected only broken and distorted
images of things. The world laughed at the
poor student, who, in his torn and threadbare
cassock, dared to lift his eyes to the Lady
Hermione
;
while he sat alone, in his desolate
chamber
,
and suffered in silence. He remembered
many things, which he would fain forget; but
which, if he had forgotten them, he would wish
again to remember. Such were the linden-trees
of Blach, under whose pleasant shade he had
told his love to Hermione. This was the scene
which he wished most to forget, yet loved most
to remember; and of this he was now dreaming,
with his hands clasped upon his book, and that
kind of music in his thoughts, which you, Lady,
mistook for rhyme.
Suddenly the cathedral clock struck twelve
with a melancholy clang. It roused the Student
Hieronymus from his dream; and rang in his ears,
like the iron hoofs of the steeds of Time. The
magic hour had come, when the Divinity of the
lamp most willingly revealed herself to her votary.
The bronze figures seemed alive; a white cloud
rose from the flame and spread itself through the
chamber, whose four walls dilated into magnificent
cloud vistas; a fragrance, as of wild-flowers, filled
the air; and a dreamy music, like distant,
sweet-chiming
bells, announced the approach of the
midnight Divinity. Through his streaming tears
the heart-broken Student beheld her once more
descending a pass in the snowy cloud-mountains,
as, at evening, the dewy Hesperus comes from the
bosom of the mist, and assumes his station in the
sky. At her approach, his spirit grew more calm;
for her presence was, to his feverish heart, like a
tropical night,beautiful and soothing and
invigorating
.
At length she stood before him
revealed
in all her beauty; and he comprehended
the visible language of her sweet but silent lips;
which seemed to say;`What would the Student
Hieronymus to-night?'`Peace!' he answered,
raising his clasped hands, and smiling through his
tears. `The Student Hieronymus imploreth peace!'
`Then go,' said the spirit, `go to the Fountain of
Oblivion in the deepest solitude of the Black
Forest
,
and cast this scroll into its waters; and thou
shalt be at peace once more. Hieronymus opened
his arms to embrace the Divinity, for her
countenance
assumed the features of Hermione; but she
vanished away; the music ceased; the gorgeous
cloud-land sank and fell asunder; and the student
was alone within the four bare walls of his
chamber
.
As he bowed his head downward, his eye
fell upon a parchment scroll, which was lying
beside
the lamp. Upon it was written only the name
of Hermione!
The next morning Hieronymus put the scroll
into his bosom, and went his way in search of the
Fountain of Oblivion. A few days brought him
to the skirts of the Black Forest. He entered,
not without a feeling of dread, that land of
shadows
;
and passed onward under melancholy pines
and cedars, whose branches grew abroad and
mingled
together, and, as they swayed up and down,
VOL. II. 5
filled the air with solemn twilight and a sound of
sorrow. As he advanced into the forest, the
waving
moss hung, like curtains, from the branches
overhead, and more and more shut out the light
of heaven; and he knew that the Fountain of
Oblivion was not far off. Even then the sound of
falling waters was mingling with the roar of the
pines overhead; and ere long he came to a river,
moving in solemn majesty through the forest, and
falling with a dull, leaden sound into a motionless
and stagnant lake, above which the branches of
the forest met and mingled, forming perpetual
night. This was the Fountain of Oblivion.
Upon its brink the student paused, and gazed
into the dark waters with a steadfast look. They
were limpid waters, dark with shadows only. And
as he gazed, he beheld, far down in their silent
depths, dim and ill-defined outlines, wavering to
and fro, like the folds of a white garment in the
twilight. Then more distinct and permanent
shapes arose;shapes familiar to his mind, yet
forgotten and remembered again, as the fragments
of a dream; till at length, far, far below him he
beheld the great city of the Past, with silent marble
streets, and moss-grown walls, and spires uprising
with a wave-like, flickering motion. And amid the
crowd that thronged those streets, he beheld faces
once familiar and dear to him; and heard
sorrowful
,
sweet voices, singing; `O forget us not! forget
us not!' and then the distant, mournful sound of
funeral bells, that were tolling below, in the city of
the Past. But in the gardens of that city, there
were children playing, and among them, one who
wore his features, as they had been in childhood.
He was leading a little girl by the hand, and
caressed
her often, and adorned her with flowers.
Then, like a dream, the scene changed, and the
boy had grown older, and stood alone, gazing into
the sky; and, as he gazed, his countenance
changed
again, and Hieronymus beheld him, as if it
had been his own image in the clear water; and
before him stood a beauteous maiden, whose face
was like the face of Hermione, and he feared lest
the scroll had fallen into the water, as he bent over
it. Starting as from a dream he put his hand into
his bosom and breathed freely again, when he
found the scroll still there. He drew it forth, and
read the blessed name of Hermione, and the city
beneath him vanished away, and the air grew
fragrant
as with the breath of May-flowers, and a
light streamed through the shadowy forest and
gleamed upon the lake; and the Student
Hieronymus
pressed the dear name to his lips and
exclaimed
with streaming eyes; `O, scorn me as thou
wilt, still, still will I love thee; and thy name shall
irradiate the gloom of my life, and make the waters
of Oblivion smile!' And the name was no longer
Hermione, but was changed to Mary; and the
Student Hieronymusis lying at your feet! O,
gentle Lady!
`I did hear you talk
Far above singing; after you were gone
I grew acquainted with my heart, and searched
What stirred it so! Alas! I found it love.
CHAPTER IX.
A TALK ON THE STAIRS.
No! I will not describe that scene; nor how
pale the stately lady sat on the border of the green,
sunny meadow! The hearts of some women
tremble
like leaves at every breath of love which
reaches them, and then are still again. Others,
like the ocean, are moved only by the breath of a
storm, and not so easily lulled to rest. And such
was the proud heart of Mary Ashburton. It had
remained unmoved by the presence of this
stranger
;
and the sound of his footsteps and his voice
excited in it no emotion. He had deceived
himself
!
Silently they walked homeward through
the green meadow. The very sunshine was sad;
and the rising wind, through the old ruin above
them, sounded in his ears like a hollow laugh!
Flemming went straight to his chamber. On
the way, he passed the walnut trees under which
he had first seen the face of Mary Ashburton.
Involuntarily he closed his eyes. They were full
of tears. O, there are places in this fair world,
which we never wish to see again, however dear
they may be to us! The towers of the old
Franciscan
convent never looked so gloomily as then,
though the bright summer sun was shining full
upon them.
In his chamber he found Berkley. He was
looking out of the window, whistling.
This evening I leave Interlachen forever, said
Flemming, rather abruptly. Berkley stared.
Indeed! Pray what is the matter? You look
as pale as a ghost!
And have good reason to look pale, replied
Flemming bitterly. Hoffmann says, in one of his
note-books, that, on the eleventh of March, at half
past eight o'clock, precisely, he was an ass. That
is what I was this morning at half past ten o'clock,
precisely, and am now, and I suppose always shall
be.
He tried to laugh, but could not. He then
related
to Berkley the whole story, from beginning
to end.
This is a miserable piece of business!
exclaimed
Berkley, when he had finished. Strange
enough! And yet I have long ceased to marvel
at the caprices of women. Did not Pan captivate
the chaste Diana? Did not Titania love Nick
Bottom, with his ass's head? Do you think that
maidens' eyes are no longer touched with the juice
of love-in-idleness! Take my word for it, she is
in love with somebody else. There must be some
reason for this. No; women never have any
reasons
,
except their will. But never mind. Keep
a stout heart. Care killed a cat. After all,what
is she? Who is she? Only a
Hush! hush, exclaimed Flemming, in great
excitement. Not one word more, I beseech you.
Do not think to console me, by depreciating her.
She is very dear to me still; a beautiful,
high-minded
,
noble woman.
Yes, answered Berkley; that is the way
with you all, you young men. You see a sweet
face, or a something, you know not what, and
flickering reason says, Good night; amen to
common
sense. The imagination invests the beloved
object with a thousand superlative charms;
furnishes
her with all the purple and fine linen, all the
rich apparel and furniture, of human nature. I did
the same when I was young. I was once as
desperately
in love as you are now; and went through
all the
`Delicious deaths, soft exhalations
Of soul; dear and divine annihilations,
A thousand unknown rites
Of joys, and rarified delights.'
I adored and was rejected. `You are in love with
certain attributes,' said the lady. `Damn your
attributes
,
Madam,' said I; `I know nothing of
attributes
.'
`Sir,' said she, with dignity, `you have
been drinking.' So we parted. She was married
afterwards to another, who knew something about
attributes, I suppose. I have seen her once since,
and only once. She had a baby in a yellow gown.
I hate a baby in a yellow gown. How glad I am
she did not marry me. One of these days, you
will be glad you have been rejected. Take my
word for it.
All that does not prevent my lot from being a
very melancholy one! said Flemming sadly.
O, never mind the lot, cried Berkley laughing,
so long as you don't get Lot's wife. If the
cucumber
is bitter, throw it away, as the philosopher
Marcus Antoninus says, in his Meditations. Forget
her, and all will be as if you had not known her.
I shall never forget her, replied Flemming,
rather solemnly. Not my pride, but my
affections
,
are wounded; and the wound is too deep
ever
to heal. I shall carry it with me always. I
enter
no more into the world, but will dwell only in
the world of my own thoughts. All great and
unusual
occurrences, whether of joy or sorrow, lift us
above this earth; and we should do well always
to preserve this elevation. Hitherto I have not
done so. But now I will no more descend; I will
5*
sit apart and above the world, with my mournful,
yet holy thoughts.
Whew! You had better go into society; the
whirl and delirium will cure you in a week. If you
find a lady, who pleases you very much, and you
wish to marry her, and she will not listen to such a
horrid thing, I see but one remedy, which is to
find another, who pleases you more, and who will
listen to it.
No, my friend; you do not understand my
character, said Flemming, shaking his head. I
love this woman with a deep, and lasting affection.
I shall never cease to love her. This may be
madness
in me; but so it is. Alas and alas! Paracelsus
of old wasted life in trying to discover its elixir,
which after all turned out to be alcohol; and
instead
of being made immortal upon earth, he died
drunk on the floor of a tavern. The like
happens
to many of us. We waste our best years in
distilling the sweetest flowers of life into
love-potions
,
which after all do not immortalize, but
only intoxicate us. By Heaven! we are all of us
mad.
But are you sure the case is utterly
hopeless
?
Utterly! utterly!
And yet I perceive you have not laid aside
all hope. You still flatter yourself, that the lady's
heart may change. The great secret of
happiness
consists not in enjoying, but in renouncing.
But it is hard, very hard. Hope has as many
lives as a cat or a king. I dare say you have heard
the old Italian proverb, `The King never dies.'
But perhaps you have never heard, that, at the
court of Naples, where the dead body of a
monarch
lies in state, his dinner is carried up to him
as usual, and the court physician tastes it, to see
that it be not poisoned, and then the servants bear
it out again, saying `The King does not dine
to-day
.'
Hope in our souls is King; and we also
say, `The King never dies.' Even when in reality
he lies dead within us, in a kind of solemn
mockery
we offer him his accustomed food, but are
constrained
to say, `The King does not dine to-day.'
It must be an evil day, indeed, when a king of
Naples
has no heart for his dinner! but you yourself
are a proof, that the King never dies. You are
feeding your King, although you say he is dead.
To show you, that I do not wish to cherish
hope, replied Flemming, I shall leave
Interlachen
to-morrow morning. I am going to the
Tyrol
.
You are right, said Berkley; there is
nothing
so good for sorrow as rapid motion in the open
air. I shall go with you; though probably your
conversation will not be very various; nothing but
Edward and Kunigunde.
What do you mean by that?
Go to Berlin, and you will find out.
However
,
jesting apart, I will do all I can to cheer you,
and make you forget the Dark Ladie, and this
untoward accident.
Accident! said Flemming. This is no
accident, but God's Providence, which brought us
together, to punish me for my sins.
O, my friend, interrupted Berkley, if you
see the finger of Providence so distinctly in every
act of your life, you will end by thinking yourself
an Apostle and Envoy Extraordinary. I see
nothing
so very uncommon in what has happened to
you.
What! not when our souls are so akin to each
other! When we seemed so formed to be
together
,to
be one!
I have often observed, replied Berkley
coldly
,
that those who are of kindred souls, rarely
wed together; almost as rarely as those who are
akin by blood. There seems, indeed, to be such a
thing as spiritual incest. Therefore, mad lover, do
not think to persuade thyself and thy scornful
lady
,
that you have kindred souls; but rather the
contrary; that you are much unlike; and each
wanting in those qualities which most mark and
distinguish the other. Trust me, thy courtship
will then be more prosperous. But good morning.
I must prepare for this sudden journey.
On the following morning, Flemming and
Berkley
started on their way to Innsbruck, like Huon
of Bordeaux and Scherasmin on their way to
Babylon
.
Berkley's self-assumed duty was to console
his companion; a duty which he performed like
an old Spanish Matadora, a woman whose
business
was to attend the sick, and put her elbow
into
the stomach of the dying to shorten their agony.
BOOK THE FOURTH.
Mortal, they softly say,
Peace to thy heart!
We too, yes, mortal,
Have been as thou art;
Hope-lifted, doubt-depressed,
Seeing in part,
Tried, troubled, tempted,
Sustained,as thou art.
BOOK THE FOURTH.
CHAPTER I.
A MISERERE.
In
the Orlando Innamorato, Malagigi, the
necromancer
,
puts all the company to sleep by reading
to them from a book. Some books have this power
of themselves and need no necromancer.
Fearing
,
gentle reader, that mine may be of this kind,
I have provided these introductory chapters, from
time to time, like stalls or Misereres in a church,
with flowery canopies and poppy-heads over them,
where thou mayest sit down and sleep.
No,the figure is not a bad one. This book
does somewhat resemble a minster, in the
Romanesque
style, with pinnacles, and flying
buttresses
,
and roofs,
Gargoyled with greyhounds, and with many lions
Made of fine gold, with divers sundry dragons.
You step into its shade and coolness out of the hot
streets of life; a mysterious light streams through
the painted glass of the marigold windows,
staining
the cusps and crumpled leaves of the
window-shafts
,
and the cherubs and holy-water-stoups
below
.
Here and there is an image of the Virgin
Mary; and other images, in divers vestures,
called weepers, stand in housings made about the
tomb; and, above all, swells the vast dome of
heaven, with its star-mouldings, and the flaming
constellations, like the mosaics in the dome of St.
Peter's. Have you not heard funeral psalms from
the chauntry? Have you not heard the sound of
church-bells, as I promised; mysterious sounds
from the Past and Future, as from the belfries
outside
the cathedral; even such a mournful, mellow,
watery peal of bells, as is heard sometimes at sea,
from cities afar off below the horizon?
I know not how this Romanesque, and at times
flamboyant, style of architecture may please the
critics. They may wish, perhaps, that I had
omitted
some of my many ornaments, my arabesques,
and roses, and fantastic spouts, and Holy-Roods
and Gallilee-steeples. But would it then have
been Romanesque?
But perhaps, gentle reader, thou art one of
those, who think the days of Romance gone
forever
.
Believe it not! O, believe it not! Thou
hast at this moment in thy heart as sweet a
romance
as was ever written. Thou art not less a
woman, because thou dost not sit aloft in a tower,
with a tassel-gentle on thy wrist! Thou art not
less a man, because thou wearest no hauberk, nor
mail-sark, and goest not on horseback after foolish
adventures! Nay, nay! Every one has a
Romance
in his own heart. All that has blessed or
awed the world lies there; and
The oracle within him, that which lives,
He must invoke and question,not dead books,
Not ordinances, not mould-rotten papers.
Sooner or later some passages of every one's
romance must be written, either in words or
actions
.
They will proclaim the truth; for Truth is
thought, which has assumed its appropriate
garments
,
either of words or actions; while
Falsehood
is thought, which, disguised in words or
actions
not its own, comes before the blind old
world, as Jacob came before the patriarch Isaac,
clothed in the goodly raiment of his brother
Esau. And the world, like the patriarch, is often
deceived; for, though the voice is Jacob's voice,
yet the hands are the hands of Esau, and the
False takes away the birth-right and the blessing
from the True. Hence it is, that the world so
often lifts up its voice and weeps.
That very pleasing and fanciful Chinese
Romance
,
the Shadow in the Water, ends with the
hero's marrying both the heroines. I hope my
gentle reader feels curious to know the end of
this Romance, which is a shadow upon the earth;
and see whether there be any marriage at all
in it.
That is the very point I am now thinking of, as
I sit here at my pleasant chamber window, and
enjoy the balmy air of a bright summer morning,
and watch the motions of the golden robin, that
sits on its swinging nest on the outermost,
pendulous
branch of yonder elm. The broad meadows
and the steel-blue river remind me of the meadows
of Unterseen, and the river Aar; and beyond
them rise magnificent snow-white clouds, piled up
like Alps. Thus the shades of Washington and
William Tell seem to walk together on these
Elysian Fields; for it was here, that in days
long gone, our great Patriot dwelt; and yonder
clouds so much resemble the snowy Alps, that
they remind me irresistibly of the Swiss. Noble
examples of a high purpose and a fixed will! Do
they not move, Hyperion-like on high? Were
they not, likewise, sons of Heaven and Earth?
Nothing can be more lovely than these summer
mornings; nor than the southern window at which
I sit and write, in this old mansion, which is like
an Italian Villa. But O, this lassitude,this
weariness,when all around me is so bright! I
have this morning a singular longing for flowers;
a wish to stroll among the roses and carnations,
and inhale their breath, as if it would revive me.
I wish I knew the man, who called flowers
the fugitive poetry of Nature. From this
distance
,
from these scholastic shades,from this
leafy, blossoming, and beautiful Cambridge, I
stretch forth my hand to grasp his, as the hand of
a poet!Yes; this morning I would rather stroll
with him among the gay flowers, than sit here and
write. I feel so weary!
Old men with their staves, says the Spanish
poet, are ever knocking at the door of the grave.
But I am not old. The Spanish poet might have
included the young also.No matter! Courage,
and forward! The Romance must be finished;
and finished soon.
O thou poor authorling! Reach a little deeper
into the human heart! Touch those strings,
touch those deeper strings, and more boldly, or
the notes will die away like whispers, and no ear
shall hear them, save thine own! And, to cheer
thy solitary labor, remember, that the secret studies
of an author are the sunken piers upon which is
to rest the bridge of his fame, spanning the dark
waters of Oblivion. They are out of sight; but
without them no superstructure can stand secure!
And now, Reader, since the sermon is over,
and we are still sitting here in this Miserere, let us
read aloud a page from the old parchment
manuscript
on the lettern before us; let us sing it
through these dusky aisles, like a Gregorian Chant,
and startle the sleeping congregation!
I have read of the great river Euripus, which
ebbeth and floweth seven times a day, and with
such violence, that it carrieth ships upon it with
full sail, directly against the wind. Seven times
in an hour ebbeth and floweth rash opinion, in the
torrent of indiscreet and troublesome
apprehensions
;
carrying critic calumny and squint-eyed
detraction
mainly against the wind of wisdom and
judgment.
In secula seculorum! Amen!
CHAPTER II.
CURFEW BELLS.
Welcome
Disappointment! Thy hand is cold
and hard, but it is the hand of a friend! Thy
voice is stern and harsh, but it is the voice of a
friend! O, there is something sublime in calm
endurance
,
something sublime in the resolute, fixed
purpose of suffering without complaining, which
makes disappointment oftentimes better than
success
!
The emperor Isaac Angelus made a treaty with
Saladin, and tried to purchase the Holy Sepulchre
with gold. Richard Lion-heart scorned such
alliance
,
and sought to recover it by battle. Thus
do weak minds make treaties with the passions
they cannot overcome, and try to purchase
happiness
at the expense of principle. But the resolute
VOL. II. 6
will of a strong man scorns such means; and
struggles
nobly with his foe, to achieve great deeds.
Therefore, whosoever thou art that sufferest, try
not to dissipate thy sorrow by the breath of the
world, nor drown its voice in thoughtless
merriment
.
It is a treacherous peace that is
purchased
by indulgence. Rather take this sorrow to
thy heart, and make it a part of thee, and it shall
nourish thee till thou art strong again.
The shadows of the mind are like those of the
body. In the morning of life they all lie behind
us; at noon, we trample them under foot; and in
the evening they stretch long, broad, and
deepening
before us. Are not, then, the sorrows of
childhood
as dark as those of age? Are not the
morning
shadows of life as deep and broad as those of
its evening? Yes; but morning shadows soon
fade away, while those of evening reach forward
into the night and mingle with the coming
darkness
.
Man is begotten in delight and born in
pain; and in these are the rapture and labor of his
life fore-shadowed from the beginning. But the
life of man upon this fair earth is made up for the
most part of little pains and little pleasures. The
great wonder-flowers bloom but once in a
lifetime
.
A week had already elapsed since the events
recorded in the last chapter. Paul Flemming
went his way, a melancholy man, drinking the
sweet wormwood of his sorrow. He did not rail
at Providence and call it fate, but suffered and
was silent. It is a beautiful trait in the lover's
character, that he thinks no evil of the object
loved. What he suffered was no swift storm of
feeling, that passes away with a noise, and leaves
the heart clearer; but a dark phantom had risen
up in the clear night, and, like that of Adamastor,
hid the stars; and if it ever vanished away for a
season, still the deep sound of the moaning main
would be heard afar, through many a dark and
lonely hour. And thus he journeyed on, wrapped
in desponding gloom, and mainly heedless of all
things around him. His mind was distempered.
That one face was always before him; that one
voice forever saying;
You are not the Magician.
Painful, indeed, it is to be misunderstood and
undervalued by those we love. But this, too,
in our life, must we learn to bear without a
murmur
;
for it is a tale often repeated.
There are persons in this world to whom all
local associations are naught. The genius of the
place speaks not to them. Even on battle-fields,
where the voice of this genius is wont to be
loudest, they hear only the sound of their own
voices; they meet there only their own dull and
pedantic thoughts, as the old grammarian Brunetto
Latini met on the plain of Roncesvalles a poor
student riding on a bay mule. This was not
always
the case with Paul Flemming, but it had
become
so now. He felt no interest in the scenery
around him. He hardly looked at it. Even
the difficult mountain-passes, where, from his
rocky eyrie the eagle-eyed Tyrolese peasant had
watched his foe, and the roaring, turbid torrent
underneath, which had swallowed up the bloody
corse, that fell from the rocks like a crushed worm,
awakened no lively emotion in his breast. All
around him seemed dreamy and vague; all within
dim, as in a sun's eclipse. As the moon, whether
visible or invisible, has power over the tides of the
ocean, so the face of that lady, whether present or
absent, had power over the tides of his soul; both
by day and night, both waking and sleeping. In
every pale face and dark eye he saw a
resemblance
to her; and what the day denied him in
reality, the night gave him in dreams.
This is a strange, fantastic world, said
Berkley
,
after a very long silence, during which the
two travellers had been sitting each in his corner
of the travelling carriage, wrapped in his own
reflections
.
A very strange, fantastic world; where
each one pursues his own golden bubble, and laughs
at his neighbour for doing the same. I have been
thinking how a moral Linnus would classify
our race. I think he would divide it, not as
Lord Byron did, into two great classes, the bores
and those who are bored, but into three,
namely
;
Happy Men, Lucky Dogs, and Miserable
Wretches. This is more true and philosophical,
though perhaps not quite so comprehensive. He
is the Happy Man, who, blessed with modest
ease, a wife and children,sits enthroned in the
hearts of his family, and knows no other ambition,
than that of making those around him happy. But
the Lucky Dog is he, who, free from all domestic
cares, saunters up and down his room, in morning
gown and slippers; drums on the window of a
rainy day; and, as he stirs his evening fire, snaps
his fingers at the world, and says, `I have no
wife nor children, good or bad, to provide for.'
I had a friend, who is now no more. He was
taken away in the bloom of life, by a very
rapidwidow. He was by birth and by
profession
a beau,born with a quizzing-glass and a
cane. Cock of the walk, he flapped his wings,
and crowed among the feathered tribe. But alas!
a fair, white partlet has torn his crest out, and he
shall crow no more. You will generally find him
of a morning, smelling round a beef-cart, with
domestic felicity written in every line of his
countenance
;
and sometimes meet him in a cross-street
at noon, hurrying homeward, with a beef-steak on
a wooden skewer, or a fresh fish, with a piece of
tarred twine run through its gills. In the evening
he rocks the cradle, and gets up in the night when
the child cries. Like a Goth, of the Dark Ages,
he consults his wife on all mighty matters, and
looks upon her as a being of more than human
goodness and wisdom. In short, the ladies all say
he is a very domestic man, and makes a good
husband
;
which, under the rose, is only a more polite
way of saying he is hen-pecked. He is a
Happy
Man. I have another dear friend, who is a
sexagenary bachelor. He has one of those
well-oiled
dispositions, which turn upon the hinges of
the world without creaking. The hey-day of life
is over with him; but his old age is sunny and
chirping; and a merry heart still nestles in his
tottering frame, like a swallow that builds in a
tumble-down chimney. He is a professed Squire
of Dames. The rustle of a silk gown is
music
to his ears, and his imagination is
continually
lantern-led by some will-with-a-wisp in the
shape of a lady's stomacher. In his devotion
to the fair sex,the muslin, as he calls it,
he is the gentle flower of chivalry. It is amusing
to see how quick he strikes into the scent of a
lady's handkerchief. When once fairly in pursuit,
there is no such thing as throwing him out. His
heart looks out at his eye; and his inward delight
tingles down to the tail of his coat. He loves to
bask in the sunshine of a smile; when he can
breathe the sweet atmosphere of kid gloves and
cambric handkerchiefs, his soul is in its element;
and his supreme delight is to pass the morning, to
use his own quaint language, `in making dodging
calls, and wiggling round among the ladies!' He is
a lucky dog!
And as a specimen of the class of Miserable
Wretches, I suppose you will take me, said
Flemming, making an effort to enter into his
friend's humor. Certainly I am wretched
enough. You may make me the stuffed bear,
the specimen of this class.
By no means, replied Berkley; you are
not reduced so low. He only is utterly wretched,
who is the slave of his own passions, or those of
others. This, I trust, will never be your
condition
.
Why so wan and pale, fond lover? Do you
remember Sir John Suckling's Song?
`Why so wan and pale, fond lover;
Pr'ythee why so pale?
Will, if looking well can't move her,
Looking ill prevail?
Pr'ythee why so pale?
`Why so dull and mute, young sinner;
Pr'ythee why so mute?
Will, if speaking well can't win her,
Saying nothing do 't?
Pr'ythee why so mute?
`Quit, quit, for shame! this cannot move,
This cannot take her!
If of herself she do not love,
Nothing will make her!
The devil take her!'
How do you like that?
6*
To you I say quit, quit for shame; replied
Flemming. Why quote the songs of that witty
and licentious age? Have you no better
consolation
to offer me? How many, many times must I
tell you, that I bear the lady no ill-will. I do
not blame her for not loving me. I desire her
happiness, even at the sacrifice of my own.
That is generous in you, and deserves a
better
fate. But you are so figurative in all you say,
that a stranger would think you had no real
feeling
,and
only fancied yourself in love.
Expression of feeling is different with different
minds. It is not always simple. Some minds,
when excited, naturally speak in figures and
similitudes
.
They do not on that account feel less
deeply. This is obvious in our commonest modes
of speech. It depends upon the individual.
Kyrie Eleson!
Well, abuse my figures of speech as much as
you please. What I insist upon is, that you shall
not abuse the lady. When did you ever hear me
breathe a whisper against her?
Oho! Now you speak like Launce to his
dog!
Their conversation, which had begun so
merrily
,
was here suddenly interrupted by a rattling
peal of thunder, that announced a near-approaching
storm. It was late in the afternoon, and the
whole heaven black with low, trailing clouds.
Still blacker the storm came sailing up majestically
from the southwest, with almost unbroken volleys
of distant thunder. The wind seemed to be
storming a cloud redoubt; and marched onward with
dust, and the green banners of the trees flapping
in the air, and heavy cannonading, and
occasionally
an explosion, like the blowing up of a
powder-wagon
.
Mingled with this was the sound of
thunder-bells
from a village not far off. They were all
ringing dolefully to ward off the thunderbolt. At
the entrance of the village stood a large wooden
crucifix; around which was a crowd of priests
and peasants, kneeling in the wet grass, by the
roadside, with their hands and eyes lifted to
heaven, and praying for rain. Their prayer was
soon answered.
The travellers drove on with the driving wind
and rain. They had come from Landeck, and
hoped to reach Innsbruck before midnight. Night
closed in, and Flemming fell asleep with the loud
storm overhead, and at his feet the roaring Inn, a
mountain torrent leaping onward as wild and
restless
,
as when it first sprang from its cradle in the
solitudes of Engaddin; meet emblem of himself,
thus rushing through the night. His slumber was
long, but broken; and at length he awoke in
terror
;
for he heard a voice pronounce in his ear
distinctly these words;
They have brought the dead body.
They were driving by a churchyard at the
entrance
of a town; and among the tombs a dim
lamp was burning before an image of the Virgin.
It had a most unearthly appearance. Flemming
almost feared to see the congregation of the dead
go into the church and sing their midnight mass.
He spoke to Berkley; but received no answer;
he was in a deep sleep.
Then it was only a dream, said he to
himself
;
yet how distinct the voice was! O, if we
had spiritual organs, to see and hear things now
invisible and inaudible to us, we should behold the
whole air filled with the departing souls of that
vast multitude which every moment dies,should
behold them streaming up like thin vapors
heaven-ward
,
and hear the startling blast of the archangel's
trump sounding incessant through the universe and
proclaiming the awful judgment day. Truly the
soul departs not alone on its last journey, but
spirits of its kind attend it, when not ministering
angels; and they go in families to the unknown
land! Neither in life nor in death are we alone.
He slept again at intervals; and at length,
though long after midnight, reached Innsbruck
between
sleeping and waking; his mind filled with
dim recollections of the unspeakably dismal
night-journey
;the
climbing of hills, and plunging
into dark ravines;the momentary rattling of the
wheels over paved streets of towns, and the
succeeding
hollow rolling and tramping on the wet
earth;the blackness of the night;the
thunder
and lightning and rain; the roar of waters,
leaping through deep chasms by the road-side, and
the wind through the mountain-passes, sounding
loud and long, like the irrepressible laughter of the
gods.
The travellers on the morrow lingered not long
in Innsbruck. They did not fail, however, to visit
the tomb of Maximilian in the Franciscan Church
of the Holy Cross, and gaze with some admiration
upon the twenty-eight gigantic bronze statues of
Godfrey of Bouillon, and King Arthur and Ernest
the Iron-man, and Frederick of the Empty
Pockets
,
kings and heroes, and others, which stand
leaning
on their swords between the columns of the
church, as if guarding the tomb of the dead.
These statues reminded Flemming of the bronze
giants, which strike the hours on the belfry of
San Basso, in Venice, and of the flail-armed
monsters
,
that guarded the gateway of Angulaffer's
castle
in Oberon. After gazing awhile at these
motionless
sentinels, they went forth, and strolled through
the public gardens, with the jagged mountains right
over their heads, and all around them tall,
melancholy
pines, like Tyrolese peasants, with shaggy
hair; and at their feet the mad torrent of the Inn,
sweeping with turbid waves through the midst of
the town. In the afternoon they drove on
towards
Salzburg through the magnificent
mountain-passes
of Waidering and Unken.
CHAPTER III.
SHADOWS ON THE WALL.
On
the following morning Flemming awoke in a
chamber of the Golden Ship at Salzburg, just as
the clock in the Dome-church opposite was
striking
ten. The window-shutters were closed, and
the room nearly dark. He was lying on his back,
with his hands crossed upon his breast, and his
eyes looking up at the white curtains overhead.
He thought them the white marble canopy of a
tomb, and himself the marble statue, lying beneath.
When the clock ceased striking, the eight and
twenty gigantic bronze statues from the Church
of Holy Rood in Innsbruck stalked into the
chamber
,
and arranged themselves along the walls,
which spread into dimly-lighted aisles and arches.
On the painted windows he saw Interlachen, with
its Franciscan cloister, and the Square Tower of the
ruins. In a pendent, overhead, stood the German
student, as Saint Vitus; and on a lavatory, or
basin
of holy-water, below, sat a cherub, with the form
and features of Berkley. Then the organ-pipes
began to blow, and he heard the voices of an
invisible
choir chanting. And anon the gilded gates
in the bronze screen before the chancel opened,
and a bridal procession passed through. The
bride was clothed in the garb of the Middle Ages;
and held a book in her hand, with velvet covers,
and golden clasps. It was Mary Ashburton. She
looked at him as she passed. Her face was pale;
and there were tears in her sweet eyes. Then
the gates closed again; and one of the oaken
poppy-heads over a carved stall, in the shape of
an owl, flapped its broad wings, and hooted,
Towhit
!
to-whoo! Then the whole scene changed;
and he thought himself a monk's-head on a
gutterspout
;
and it rained dismally; and Berkley was
standing under with an umbrella, laughing!
In other words, Flemming was in a raging
fever, and delirious. He remained in this state for
a week. The first thing he was conscious of was
hearing the doctor say to Berkley;
The crisis is passed. I now consider him out
of danger.
He then fell into a sweet sleep; the wild fever
had swept away like an angry, red cloud, and the
refreshing summer rain began to fall like dew upon
the parched earth. Still another week; and
Flemming was, sitting clothed, and in his right
mind. Berkley had been reading to him; and
still held the book in his hand, with his fore-finger
between the leaves. It was a volume of
Hoffmann's
writings.
How very strange it is, said he, that you
can hardly open the biography of any German
author
,
but you will find it begin with an account of his
grandfather. It will tell you how the venerable
old man walked up and down the garden among
the gay flowers, wrapped in his morning gown,
which is likewise covered with flowers, and
perhaps
wearing on his head a little velvet cap. Or
you will find him sitting by the chimney-corner in
the great chair, smoking his ancestral pipe, with
shaggy eyebrows and eyes like birdsnests under
the eaves of a house, and a mouth like a
Nuremberg
nutcracker's. The future poet climbs upon
the old man's knees. His genius is not recognised
yet. He is thought for the most part a dull boy.
His father is an austere man, or perhaps dead. But
the mother is still there, a sickly, saint-like
woman
,
with knitting-work, and an elder sister, who
has already been in love, and wears rings on
her fingers;
`Death's heads, and such mementos,
Her grandmother and worm-eaten aunts left to her,
To tell her what her beauty must arrive at.'
But this is not the case with the life of
Hoffmann
,
if I recollect right.
No, not precisely. Instead of the grandfather
we have the grandmother, a stately dame, who has
long since shaken hands with the vanities of life.
The mother, separated from her husband, is sick in
mind and body, and flits to and fro, like a shadow.
Then there is an affectionate maiden aunt; and an
uncle, a retired judge, the terror of little boys,
the Giant Despair of this Doubting Castle in
Koenigsberg
;
and occasionally the benign countenance
of a venerable grand-uncle, whom Lamotte Fouqu
called a hero of the olden time in morning gown and
slippers, looks in at the door and smiles. In the
upper story of the same house lived a poor boy with
his mother, who was so far crazed as to believe
herself to be the Virgin Mary, and her son the
Saviour
of the world. Wild fancies, likewise, were to
sweep through the brain of that child. He was to
meet Hoffmann elsewhere and be his friend in
after years, though as yet they knew nothing of
each other. This was Werner, who has made
some noise in German literature as the author of
many wild Destiny-Dramas.
Hoffmann died, I believe, in Berlin.
Yes. He left Koenigsberg at twenty years of
age, and passed the next eight years of his life in
the Prussian-Polish Provinces, where he held some
petty office under government; and took to
himself
many bad habits and a Polish wife. After
this he was Music-Director at various German
theatres
,
and led a wandering, wretched life for ten
years. He then went to Berlin as Clerk of the
Exchange, and there remained till his death, which
took place some seven or eight years afterward.
Did you ever see him?
I was in Berlin during his lifetime, and saw
him frequently. I shall never forget the first time.
It was at one of the
sthetic Teas,
given by a
literary lady
Unter den Linden,
where the lions
were fed with convenient food, from tea and bread
and butter, up to oysters and Rhine-wine.
During
the evening my attention was arrested by the
entrance of a strange little figure, with a wild head
of brown hair. His eyes were bright gray; and
his thin lips closely pressed together with an
expression
of not unpleasing irony. This
strange-looking
personage began to bow his way through
the crowd, with quick, nervous, hinge-like motions,
much resembling those of a marionette. He had
a hoarse voice, and such a rapid utterance, that
although
I understood German well enough for
ordinary
purposes, I could not understand one half
he said. Ere long he had seated himself at the
piano-forte, and was improvising such wild, sweet
fancies, that the music of one's dreams is not more
sweet and wild. Then suddenly some painful
thought seemed to pass over his mind, as if he
imagined
,
that he was there to amuse the company.
He rose from the piano-forte, and seated himself
in another part of the room; where he began to
make grimaces, and talk loud while others were
singing. Finally he disappeared, like a hobgoblin,
laughing, `Ho! ho! ho!' I asked a person
beside
me who this strange being was. `That was
Hoffmann,' was the answer. `The Devil!' said I.
`Yes,' continued my informant; `and if you should
follow him now, you would see him plunge into an
obscure and unfrequented wine-cellar, and there,
amid boon companions, with wine and
tobacco-smoke
,
and quirks and quibbles, and quaint, witty
sayings, turn the dim night into glorious day.'
What a strange being!
I once saw him at one of his night-carouses.
He was sitting in his glory, at the head of the
table
;
not stupidly drunk, but warmed with wine,
which made him madly eloquent, as the Devil's
Elixir did the Monk Medardus. There, in the full
tide of witty discourse, or, if silent, his gray, hawk
eye flashing from beneath his matted hair, and
taking
note of all that was grotesque in the company
round him, sat this unfortunate genius, till the day
began to dawn. Then he found his way
homeward
,
having, like the souls of the envious in
Purgatory
,
his eyelids sewed together with iron wire;
though his was from champagne bottles. At
such hours he wrote his wild, fantastic tales. To
his excited fancy everything assumed a spectral
look. The shadows of familiar things about him
stalked like ghosts through the haunted chambers
of his soul; and the old portraits on the walls
winked at him, and seemed stepping down from
their frames; till, aghast at the spectral throng
about him, he would call his wife from her bed, to
sit by him while he wrote.
No wonder he died in the prime of life!
No. The only wonder is, that he could have
followed this course of life for six years. I am
astonished
that it did not kill him sooner.
But death came at last in an appalling shape.
Yes; his forty-sixth birth day found him
sitting
at home in his arm-chair, with his friends
around him. But the rare old wine,he always
drank the best,touched not the sick-man's lips
that night. His wonted humor was gone. Of all
his `jibes, his gambols, his songs, his flashes of
merriment
,
that were wont to set the table on a roar,
not one now, to mock his own grinning!quite
chap-fallen.'The conversation was of death and
the grave. And when one of his friends said, that
life was not the highest good, Hoffmann
interrupted
him, exclaiming with a startling earnestness;
`No, no! Life, life, only life! on any condition
whatsoever!' Five months after this he had ceased
to suffer, because he had ceased to live. He died
piecemeal. His feet and hands, his legs and
arms, gradually, and in succession, became
motionless
,
dead. But his spirit was not dead, nor
motionless; and, through the solitary day or
sleepless
night, lying in his bed, he dictated to an
amanuensis
his last stories. Strange stories, indeed,
were they for a dying man to write! Yet such
delight did he take in dictating them, that he said
to his friend Hitzig, that, upon the whole, he was
willing to give up forever the use of his hands, if
he could but preserve the power of writing by
dictation
.
Such was his love of life,of what he
called the sweet habitude of being!
Was it not he, who in his last hours expressed
such a longing to behold the green fields once
more; and exclaimed; `Heaven! it is already
summer, and I have not yet seen a single green
tree!'
Yes, that was Hoffmann. Soon afterwards he
died. The closing scene was striking. He
gradually
lost all sensation, though his mind remained
vigorous. Feeling no more pain, he said to his
physician; `It will soon be over now. I feel no
more pain.' He thought himself well again; but
VOL. II. 7
the physician knew that he was dying, and said;
`Yes, it will soon be over!' The next morning
he called his wife to his bed-side; and begged her
to fold his motionless hands together. Then, as
he raised his eyes to heaven, she heard him say,
`We must, then, think of God, also!' More
sorrowful
words than these have seldom fallen from
the lips of man. Shortly afterwards the flame of
life glared up within him; he said he was well
again; that in the evening he should go on with
the story he was writing; and wished that the
last sentence might be read over to him. Shortly
after this they turned his face to the wall, and he
died.
And thus passed to its account a human soul,
after much self-inflicted suffering. Let us tread
lightly upon the poet's ashes. For my part, I
confess, that I have not the heart to take him from
the general crowd of erring, sinful men, and judge
him harshly. The little I have seen of the world,
and know of the history of mankind, teaches me
to look upon the errors of others in sorrow, not in
anger. When I take the history of one poor heart
that has sinned and suffered, and represent to
myself
the struggles and temptations it has passed,
the brief pulsations of joy,the feverish
inquie-tude
of hope and fear,the tears of regret,
the feebleness of purpose,the pressure of want,
the desertion of friends,the scorn of a world
that has little charity,the desolation of the
soul's sanctuary,and threatening voices within,
health gone,happiness gone,even hope,
that stays longest with us, gone,I have little
heart for aught else than thankfulness, that it is
not so with me, and would fain leave the erring
soul of my fellow-man with Him, from whose
hands it came,
`even as a little child,
Weeping and laughing in its childish sport.'
You are right. And it is worth a student's
while to observe calmly how tobacco, wine, and
midnight did their work like fiends upon the
delicate frame of Hoffmann; and no less
thoroughly
upon his delicate mind. He who drinks beer,
thinks beer; and he who drinks wine, thinks
wine;and he who drinks midnight, thinks
midnight
.
He was a man of rare intellect. He was
endowed with racy humor and sarcastic wit, and a
glorious imagination. But the fire of his genius
burned not peacefully, and with a steady flame,
upon the hearth of his home. It was a glaring
and irregular flame;for the branches that he fed
it with, were not branches from the Tree of Life,
but from another tree that grew in Paradise,
and they were wet with the unhealthy dews
of night, and more unhealthy wine; and thus, amid
smoke and ashes the fire burned fitfully, and went
out with a glare, which leaves the beholder blind.
This fire within him was a Meleager's
fire-brand
;
and, when it burned out, he died. And, as
you say, marks of all this are clearly visible in
Hoffmann's
writings. Indeed, when I read his strange
fancies, it is with me, as when in the summer
night I hear the rising wind among the trees, and
the branches bow, and beckon with their long
fingers, and voices go gibbering and mocking
through the air. A feeling of awe and
mysterious
dread comes over me. I wish to hear the
sound of living voice or footstep near me,to
see a friendly and familiar face. In truth, if it be
late at night, the reader as well as the writer of
these unearthly fancies, would fain have a patient,
meek-eyed wife, with her knitting-work, at his
elbow.
Berkley smiled; but Flemming continued
without
noticing the smile, though he knew what was
passing in the mind of his friend;
The life and writings of this singular being
interest me in a high degree. Oftentimes one may
learn more from a man's errors, than from his
virtues
.
Moreover, from the common sympathies of
our nature, souls that have struggled and suffered
are dear to me. Willingly do I recognise their
brotherhood. Scars upon their foreheads do not so
deform them, that they cease to interest. They
are always signs of struggle; though alas! too
often, likewise, of defeat. Seasons of unhealthy,
dreamy, vague delight, are followed by seasons of
weariness and darkness. Where are then the
bright fancies, that, amid the great stillness of the
night, arise like stars in the firmament of our
souls? The morning dawns, the light of common
day shines in upon us, and the heavens are
without
a star! From the lives of such men we learn,
that mere pleasant sensations are not happiness;
that sensual pleasures are to be drunk sparingly,
and, as it were, from the palm of the hand; and
that those who bow down upon their knees to
drink of these bright streams that water life, are
not chosen of God either to overthrow or to
overcome
!
I think you are very lenient in your
judgment
.
This is not the usual defect of critics.
Like Shakspeare's samphire-gatherer, they have a
dreadful trade! and, to make the simile complete,
they ought to hang for it!
Methinks it would be hard to hang a man for
the sake of a simile. But which of Hoffmann's
works is it, that you have in your hand?
His Phatasy-Pieces in Callot's manner. Who
was this Callot?
He was a Lorrain painter of the seventeenth
century, celebrated for his wild and grotesque
conceptions
.
These sketches of Hoffmann are
imitations
of his style. They are full of humor,
poetry
,
and brilliant imagination.
And which of them shall I read to you? The
Ritter Glck; or the Musical Sufferings of John
Kreisler; or that very exquisite story of the
Golden Jar, wherein is depicted the life of Poesy,
in this common-place world of ours?
Read the shortest. Read Kreisler. That
will amuse me. It is a picture of his own
sufferings
at the
sthetic Teas
in Berlin, supposed
to be written in pencil on the blank leaves of a
music-book.
Thereupon Berkley leaned back in his
easychair
,
and read as follows.
CHAPTER IV.
MUSICAL SUFFERINGS OF JOHN KREISLER.
They
are all gone! I might have known it
by the whispering, shuffling, coughing, buzzing
through all the notes of the gamut. It was a true
swarm of bees, leaving the old hive. Gottlieb has
lighted fresh candles for me, and placed a bottle
of Burgundy on the piano-forte. I can play no
more, I am perfectly exhausted. My glorious old
friend here on the music-stand is to blame for
that. Again he has borne me away through the
air, as Mephistopheles did Faust, and so high, that
I took not the slightest notice of the little men
under me, though I dare say they made noise
enough. A rascally, worthless, wasted evening!
But now I am well and merry! However, while
I was playing, I took out my pencil, and on page
sixty-three, under the last system, noted down a
couple of good flourishes in cipher with my right
hand, while the left was struggling away in the
torrent of sweet sounds. Upon the blank page at
the end I go on writing. I leave all ciphers and
sweet tones, and with true delight, like a sick man
restored to health, who can never stop relating
what he has suffered, I note down here
circumstantially
the dire agonies of this evening's tea-party.
And not for myself alone, but likewise for all those
who from time to time may amuse and edify
themselves with my copy of John Sebastian
Bach's Variations for the Piano-forte, published by
Ngeli in Zrich, and who find my marks at the
end of the thirtieth variation, and, led on by the
great Latin
Verte,
(I will write it down the
moment
I get through this doleful statement of
grievances
,)
turn over the leaf and read.
They will at once see the connexion. They
know, that the Geheimerath Rdelein's house is a
charming house to visit in, and that he has two
daughters, of whom the whole fashionable world
7*
proclaims with enthusiasm, that they dance like
goddesses, speak French like angels, and play and
sing and draw like the Muses. The Geheimerath
Rdelein is a rich man. At his quarterly dinners
he brings on the most delicious wines and richest
dishes. All is established on a footing of the
greatest elegance; and whoever at his tea-parties
does not amuse himself heavenly, has no ton, no
esprit,
and particularly no taste for the fine arts.
It is with an eye to these, that, with the tea, punch,
wine, ice-creams, etc., a little music is always
served up, which, like the other refreshments, is
very quietly swallowed by the fashionable world.
The arrangements are as follows.After every
guest has had time enough to drink as many cups of
tea as he may wish, and punch and ices have been
handed round twice, the servants wheel out the
card-tables for the elder and more solid part of the
company, who had rather play cards than any
musical
instrument; and, to tell the truth, this kind of
playing does not make such a useless noise as
others
,
and you hear only the clink of money.
This is a hint for the younger part of the
company
to pounce upon the Misses Rdelein. A
great tumult ensues; in the midst of which you
can distinguish these words,
`
Schnes Frulein!
do not refuse us the
gratification of your heavenly talent! O, sing
something! that's a good dear!impossible,
bad cold,the last ball! have not practised
anything
,oh,
do, do, we beg of you,' etc.
Meanwhile Gottlieb has opened the piano-forte,
and placed the well-known music-book on the
stand; and from the card-table cries the
respectable
mamma,
`
Chantez donc, mes enfans!
'
That is the cue of
my
part. I place myself at
the piano-forte, and the Rdeleins are led up to the
instrument in triumph.
And now another difficulty arises. Neither
wishes to sing first.
`You know, dear Nanette, how dreadful hoarse
I am.'
`Why, my dear Marie, I am as hoarse as you
are.'
`I sing so badly!'
`O, my dear child;
do
begin!'
My suggestion, (I always make the same!)
that they should both begin together with a duet,
is loudly applauded;the music-book is thumbed
over, and the leaf, carefully folded down, is at
length found, and away we go with
Dolce dell'
anima,
etc.
To tell the truth, the talent of the Misses
Rdelein
is not the smallest. I have been an instructer
here only five years, and little short of two years in
the Rdelein family. In this short time, Frulein
Nanette has made such progress, that a tune,
which she has heard at the theatre only ten times,
and has played on the piano-forte, at farthest, ten
times more, she will sing right off, so that you
know in a moment what it is. Frulein Marie
catches it at the eighth time; and if she is
sometimes
a quarter of a note lower than the piano-forte,
after all it is very tolerable, considering her pretty
little doll-face, and very passable rosy-lips.
After the duet, a universal chorus of applause!
And now arriettas and duettinos succeed each
other, and right merrily I hammer away at the
thousand-times-repeated accompaniment. During
the singing, the Finanzrthin Eberstein, by
coughing
and humming, has given to understand that she
also sings. Frulein Nanette says;
`But, my dear Finanzrthin, now you must let
us hear
your
exquisite voice.'
A new tumult arises. She has a bad cold in
her head,she does not know anything by heart!
Gottlieb brings straightway two armfuls of
music-books
;
and the leaves are turned over again and
again. First she thinks she will sing
Der Hlle
Rache,
etc., then
Hebe sich,
etc., then
Ach, Ich
liebte,
etc. In this embarrassment, I propose,
Ein
Veilchen auf der Wiese,
etc. But she is for the
heroic style; she wants to make a display, and
finally selects the aria in Constantia.
O scream, squeak, mew, gurgle, groan, agonize,
quiver, quaver, just as much as you please,
Madam
,I
have my foot on the fortissimo pedal,
and thunder myself deaf! O Satan, Satan! which
of thy goblins damned has got into this throat,
pinching, and kicking, and cuffing the tones about
so! Four strings have snapped already, and one
hammer is lamed for life. My ears ring again,
my head hums,my nerves tremble! Have all
the harsh notes from the cracked trumpet of a
strolling-player been imprisoned in this little throat!
(But this excites me,I must drink a glass of
Burgundy.)
The applause was unbounded; and some one
observed, that the Finanzrthin and Mozart had
put me quite in a blaze. I smiled with downcast
eyes, very stupidly. I could but acknowledge it.
And now all talents, which hitherto had bloomed
unseen, were in motion, wildly flitting to and fro.
They were bent upon a surfeit of music; tuttis,
finales, choruses must be performed. The
Canonicus
Kratzer sings, you know, a heavenly bass, as
was observed by the gentleman yonder, with the
head of Titus Andronicus, who modestly remarked
also, that he himself was properly only a
second-rate
tenor; but, though he said it, who should not
say it, was nevertheless member of several
academies
of music. Forthwith preparations are made
for the first chorus in the opera of Titus. It went
off gloriously. The Canonicus, standing close
behind
me, thundered out the bass over my head, as
if he were singing with bass-drums and trumpet
obbligato
in a cathedral. He struck the notes
gloriously
;
but in his hurry he got the
tempo
just
about twice too slow. However, he was true to
himself at least in this, that through the whole
piece he dragged along just half a beat behind the
rest. The others showed a most decided penchant
for the ancient Greek music, which, as is well
known, having nothing to do with harmony, ran
on in
unison
or monotone. They all sang treble,
with slight variations, caused by accidental
rising
and falling of the voice, say some quarter of a
note.
This somewhat noisy affair produced a
universal
tragic state of feeling, namely a kind of
terror
,
even at the card-tables, which for the moment
could no longer, as before, chime in melodramatic,
by weaving into the music sundry exclamations;
as, for instance;
`O! I loved,eight and forty,was so
happy,I pass,then I knew not,whist,
pangs of love,follow suit,' etc.It has a very
pretty effect. (I fill my glass.)
That was the highest point of the musical
exhibition
this evening. `Now it is all over,' thought
I to myself. I shut the book, and got up from the
piano-forte. But the baron, my ancient tenor,
came up to me, and said;
`My dear Herr Capellmeister, they say you
play the most exquisite voluntaries! Now do play
us one; only a short one, I entreat you!'
I answered very drily, that to-day my fantasies
had all gone a wool-gathering; and, while we are
talking about it, a devil, in the shape of a dandy,
with two waistcoats, had smelt out Bach's
Variations
,
which were lying under my hat in the next
room. He thinks they are merely little variations,
such as
Nel cor mio non pi sento,
or
Ah, vous
dirai-je, maman,
etc., and insists upon it, that I
shall
play them. I try to excuse myself, but they
all attack me. So then, `Listen, and burst with
ennui
,'
think I to myself,and begin to work away.
When I had got to variation number three,
several ladies departed, followed by the gentleman
with the Titus-Andronicus head. The Rdeleins,
as their teacher was playing, stood it out, though
not without difficulty, to number twelve.
Number
fifteen made the man with two waistcoats take
to his heels. Out of most excessive politeness,
the Baron stayed till number thirty, and drank up
all the punch, which Gottlieb placed on the
piano-forte
for me.
I should have brought all to a happy
conclusion
,
but, alas! this number thirty,the
theme,
tore me irresistibly away. Suddenly the quarto
leaves spread out to a gigantic folio, on which a
thousand imitations and developments of the theme
stood written, and I could not choose but play
them. The notes became alive, and glimmered
and hopped all round about me,an electric fire
streamed through the tips of my fingers into the
keys,the spirit, from which it gushed forth,
spread his broad wings over my soul, the whole
room was filled with a thick mist, in which the
candles burned dim,and through which peered
forth now a nose, and anon a pair of eyes, and
then suddenly vanished away again. And thus it
came to pass, that I was left alone with my
Sebastian
Bach, by Gottlieb attended, as by a familiar
spirit. (Your good health, Sir.)
Is an honest musician to be tormented with
music, as I have been to-day, and am so often
tormented
?
Verily, no art is so damnably abused,
as this same glorious, holy
Musica,
who, in her
delicate being, is so easily desecrated. Have you
real talent,real feeling for art? Then study
music;do something worthy of the art,and
dedicate your whole soul to the beloved saint. If
without this you have a fancy for quavers and
demi-semi-quavers, practise for yourself and by
yourself, and torment not therewith the
Capellmeister
Kreisler and others.
Well, now I might go home, and put the
finishing
touch to my sonata for the piano-forte; but
it is not yet eleven o'clock, and, withal, a beautiful
summer night. I will lay any wager, that, at my
next-door neighbour's, (the Oberjgermeister,) the
young ladies are sitting at the window, screaming
down into the street, for the twentieth time, with
harsh, sharp, piercing voices, `When thine eye is
beaming love,'but only the first stanza, over and
over again. Obliquely across the way, some one
is murdering the flute, and has, moreover, lungs
like Rameau's nephew; and, in notes of `linked
sweetness long drawn out,' his neighbour is trying
acoustic experiments on the French horn. The
numerous dogs of the neighbourhood are growing
unquiet, and my landlord's cat, inspired by that
sweet duet, is making close by my window (for, of
course, my musico-poetic laboratory is an attic,)
certain tender confessions,upward through the
whole chromatic scale, soft complaining, to the
neighbour's puss, with whom he has been in love
since March last! Till this is all fairly over, I
I think will sit quietly here. Besides, there is still
blank paper and Burgundy left, of which I
forthwith
take a sip.
There is, as I have heard, an ancient law,
forbidding
those, who followed any noisy handicraft,
from living near literary men. Should not then
musical composers, poor, and hard beset, and who,
moreover, are forced to coin their inspiration into
gold, to spin out the thread of life withal, be
allowed
to apply this law to themselves, and banish
out of the neighbourhood all ballad-singers and
bagpipers? What would a painter say, while
transferring
to his canvass a form of ideal beauty, if
you should hold up before him all manner of wild
faces and ugly masks? He might shut his eyes,
and in this way, at least, quietly follow out the
images of fancy. Cotton, in one's ears, is of no
use; one still hears the dreadful massacre. And
then the idea,the bare idea, `Now they are
going to sing,now the horn strikes up,'is
enough to send one's sublimest conceptions to the
very devil.
CHAPTER V.
SAINT GILGEN.
It
was a bright Sunday morning when
Flemming
and Berkley left behind them the
cloud-capped
hills of Salzburg, and journeyed eastward
towards the lakes. The landscape around them
was one to attune their souls to holy musings.
Field, forest, hill and vale, fresh air, and the
perfume
of clover-fields and new-mown hay, birds
singing, and the sound of village bells, and the
moving breeze among the branches,no laborers
in the fields, but peasants on their way to church,
coming across the green pastures, with roses in
their hats,the beauty and quiet of the holy day
of rest,all, all in earth and air, breathed upon
the soul like a benediction.
They stopped to change horses at Hof, a
handful
of houses on the brow of a breezy hill, the
church and tavern standing opposite to each other,
and nothing between them but the dusty road, and
the churchyard, with its iron crosses, and the
fluttering
tinsel of the funeral garlands. In the
churchyard and at the tavern-door, were groups
of peasants, waiting for divine service to begin.
They were clothed in their holiday dresses. The
men wore breeches and long boots, and frock-coats
with large metal buttons; the women, straw hats,
and gay calico gowns, with short waists and scant
folds. They were adorned with a profusion of
great, trumpery ornaments, and reminded Flemming
of the Indians in the frontier villages of America.
Near the churchyard-gate was a booth, filled with
flaunting calicos; and opposite sat an old woman
behind a table, which was loaded with
ginger-bread
.
She had a roulette at her elbow, where
the peasants risked a kreutzer for a cake. On
other tables, cases of knives, scythes,
reaping-hooks
,
and other implements of husbandry were
offered for sale.
The travellers continued their journey, without
stopping to hear mass. In the course of the
forenoon
they came suddenly in sight of the beautiful
Lake of Saint Wolfgang, lying deep beneath them
in the valley. On its shore, under them, sat the
white village of Saint Gilgen, like a swan upon its
reedy nest. They seemed to have taken it
unawares
,
and as it were clapped their hands upon it
in its sleep, and almost expected to see it spread
its broad, snow-white wings, and fly away. The
whole scene was one of surpassing beauty.
They drove leisurely down the steep hill, and
stopped at the village inn. Before the door was
a magnificent, broad-armed tree, with benches and
tables beneath its shadow. On the front of the
house was written in large letters, Post-Tavern
by Franz Schoendorfer; and over this was a
large sun-dial, and a half-effaced painting of a
bear-hunt
,
covering the whole side of the house, and
mostly red. Just as they drove up, a procession of
priests with banners, and peasants with their hats
in their hands, passed by towards the church.
They were singing a solemn psalm. At the same
moment, a smart servant girl, with a black straw
hat, set coquettishly on her flaxen hair, and a
large silver spoon stuck in her girdle, came out
of the tavern, and asked Flemming what he would
please to order for breakfast.
Breakfast was soon ready, and was served up at
the head of the stairs, on an old-fashioned oaken
table in the great hall, into which the chambers
opened. Berkley ordered at the same time a tub
of cold water, in which he seated himself, with his
coat on, and a bed-quilt thrown round his knees.
Thus he sat for an hour; ate his breakfast, and
smoked a pipe, and laughed a good deal. He
then went to bed and slept till dinner time.
Meanwhile
Flemming sat in his chamber and read. It
was a large room in the front of the house, looking
upon the village and the lake. The windows
were latticed, with small panes, and the
window-sills
filled with fragrant flowers.
At length the heat of the noon was over. Day,
like a weary pilgrim, had reached the western
gate of Heaven, and Evening stooped down to
unloose the latchets of his sandal-shoon.
Flemming
and Berkley sallied forth to ramble by the
borders of the lake. Down the cool, green glades
and alleys, beneath the illuminated leaves of the
forest, over the rising grounds, in the glimmering
fretwork of sunshine and leaf-shadow,an
exhilarating
walk! The cool evening air by the lake
was like a bath. They drank the freshness of the
hour in thirsty draughts, and their breasts heaved
rejoicing and revived, after the feverish, long
confinement
of the sultry summer day. And there,
too, lay the lake, so beautiful and still! Did it
not recall, think ye, the lake of Thun?
On their return homeward they passed near the
village churchyard.
Let us go in and see how the dead rest,
said Flemming, as they passed beneath the belfry
of the church; and they went in, and lingered
among the tombs and the evening shadows.
How peaceful is the dwelling-place of those
who inhabit the green hamlets, and populous cities
VOL. II. 8
of the dead! They need no antidote for care,
nor armour against fate. No morning sun shines in
at the closed windows, and awakens them, nor shall
until the last great day. At most a straggling
sunbeam
creeps in through the crumbling wall of an
old neglected tomb,a strange visiter, that stays
not long. And there they all sleep, the holy ones,
with their arms crossed upon their breasts, or lying
motionless by their sides,not carved in marble
by the hand of man, but formed in dust, by the
hand of God. God's peace be with them. No
one comes to them now, to hold them by the hand,
and with delicate fingers smooth their hair. They
heed no more the blandishments of earthly
friendship
.
They need us not, however much we may
need them. And yet they silently await our
coming.
Beautiful is that season of life, when we can
say, in the language of Scripture, Thou hast the
dew of thy youth. But of these flowers Death
gathers many. He places them upon his bosom,
and his form becomes transformed into something
less terrific than before. We learn to gaze and
shudder not; for he carries in his arms the sweet
blossoms of our earthly hopes. We shall see them
all again, blooming in a happier land.
Yes, Death brings us again to our friends. They
are waiting for us, and we shall not live long.
They have gone before us, and are like the angels
in heaven. They stand upon the borders of the
grave to welcome us, with the countenance of
affection
,
which they wore on earth; yet more
lovely
,
more radiant, more spiritual! O, he spake well
who said, that graves are the foot-prints of angels.
Death has taken thee, too, and thou hast the
dew of thy youth. He has placed thee upon his
bosom, and his stern countenance wears a smile.
The far country, toward which we journey, seems
nearer to us, and the way less dark; for thou hast
gone before, passing so quietly to thy rest, that day
itself dies not more calmly!
It was in an hour of blessed communion with
the souls of the departed, that the sweet poet
Henry Vaughan wrote those few lines, which
have made death lovely, and his own name
immortal
!
They
are all gone into a world of light,
And I alone sit lingering here!
Their very memory is fair and bright,
And my sad thoughts doth clear.
It glows and glitters in my cloudy breast,
Like stars upon some gloomy grove,
Or those faint beams in which the hill is dressed,
After the sun's remove.
I see them walking in an air of glory,
Whose light doth trample on my days,
My days, which are at best but dull and hoary,
Mere glimmerings and decays.
O holy hope, and high humility,
High as the heavens above!
These are your walks, and ye have showed them me,
To kindle my cold love.
Dear, beauteous Death! the jewel of the just!
Shining nowhere but in the dark!
What mysteries do lie beyond thy dust,
Could man outlook that mark!
He that hath found some fledged bird's nest, may know,
At first sight, if the bird be flown;
But what fair field or grove he sings in now,
That is to him unknown.
And yet as angels, in some brighter dreams,
Call to the soul, when man doth sleep,
So some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes,
And into glory peep!
Such were Flemming's thoughts, as he stood
among the tombs at evening in the churchyard of
Saint Gilgen. A holy calm stole over him. The
fever of his heart was allayed. He had a
moment's
rest from pain; and went back to his
chamber
in peace. Whence came this holy calm, this
long-desired tranquillity? He knew not; yet the
place seemed consecrated. He resolved to linger
there, beside the lake, which was a Pool of
Bethesda
for him; and let Berkley go on alone to
the baths of Ischel. He would wait for him there
in the solitude of Saint Gilgen. Long after they
had parted for the night, he sat in his chamber,
and thought of what he had suffered, and enjoyed
the silence within and without. Hour after hour,
slipped by unheeded, as he sat lost in his reverie.
At length, his candle sank in its socket, gave one
flickering gleam, and expired with a sob. This
aroused him.
He went to the window, and peered out into
the dark night. It was very late. Twice already
since midnight had the great pulpit-orator Time,
like a preacher in the days of the Puritans, turned
the hour-glass on his high pulpit, the church
belfry
,
and still went on with his sermon, thundering
downward to the congregation in the churchyard
and in the village. But they heard him not.
They were all asleep in their narrow pews,
namely
,
in their beds and in their graves. Soon
afterward
the cock crew; and the cloudy heaven, like
the apostle, who denied his Lord, wept bitterly.
CHAPTER VI.
SAINT WOLFGANG.
The
morning is lovely beyond expression. The
heat of the sun is great; but a gentle wind cools
the air. Birds never sang more loud and clear.
The flowers, too, on the window-sill, and on the
table, rose, geranium, and the delicate crimson
cactus, are all so beautiful, that we think the
German
poet right, when he calls the flowers stars
in the firmament of the earth. Out of doors all
is quiet. Opposite the window stands the village
schoolhouse. There are two parasite trees, with
their outspread branches nailed against the white
walls, like the wings of culprit kites. There the
rods grow. Under them, on a bench at the door,
sit school-girls; and barefoot urchins in breeches
are spelling out their lessons. The clock strikes
twelve, and one by one they disappear, and go
into the hive, like bees at the sound of a brass
pan. At the door of the next house sits a poor
woman, knitting in the shade; and in front of her
is an aqueduct pouring its cool, clear water into a
rough wooden trough. A travelling carriage
without
horses, stands at the inn-door, and a postilion
in red jacket is talking with a blacksmith, who
wears blue woollen stockings and a leather apron.
Beyond is a stable, and still further a cluster of
houses and the village church. They are
repairing
the belfry and the bulbous steeple. A little
farther, over the roofs of the houses, you can see
Saint Wolfgang's Lake. Water so bright and
beautiful hardly flows elsewhere. Green, and
blue, and silver-white run into each other, with
almost imperceptible change, like the streaks on
the sides of a mackerel. And above are the
pinnacles of the mountains; some bald, and rocky,
and cone-shaped, and others bold, and broad, and
dark with pines.
Such was the scene, which Paul Flemming
beheld
from his window a few mornings after
Berkley's
departure. The quiet of the place had
soothed him. He had become more calm. His
heart complained less loudly in the holy village
silence, as we are wont to lower our voices when
those around us speak in whispers. He began to
feel at times an interest in the lowly things
around him. The face of the landscape pleased
him, but more than this the face of the poor
woman who sat knitting in the shade. It was a
pale, meek countenance, with more delicacy in
its features than is usual among peasantry. It
wore also an expression of patient suffering. As
he was looking at her, a deformed child came
out of the door and hung upon her knees. She
caressed him affectionately. It was her child;
in whom she beheld her own fair features
distorted
and hardly to be recognised, as one
sometimes
sees his face reflected from the bowl of a
spoon.
The child's deformity and the mother's
tenderness
interested the feelings of Flemming. The
8*
landlady told him something of the poor woman's
history. She was the widow of a blacksmith,
who had died soon after their marriage. But she
survived to become a mother, just as, in oaks,
immediately
after fecundation, the male flower fades
and falls, while the female continues and ripens
into perfect fruit. Alas! her child was deformed.
Yet she looked upon him with eyes of maternal
fondness and pity, loving him still more for his
deformity. And in her heart she said, as the
Mexicans say to their new-born offspring, Child,
thou art come into the world to suffer. Endure,
and hold thy peace. Though poor, she was not
entirely destitute; for her husband had left her,
beside the deformed child, a life estate in a tomb
in the churchyard of Saint Gilgen. During the
week she labored for other people, and on
Sundays
for herself, by going to church and reading
the Bible. On one of the blank leaves she had
recorded the day of her birth, and that of her
child's, likewise her marriage and her husband's
death. Thus she lived, poor, patient and
resigned
.
Her heart was a passion-flower, bearing
within it the crown of thorns and the cross of
Christ. Her ideas of Heaven were few and
simple
.
She rejected the doctrine that it was a place
of constant activity, and not of repose, and
believed
,
that, when she at length reached it, she
should work no more, but sit always in a clean
white apron, and sing psalms.
As Flemming sat meditating on these things, he
paid new homage in his heart to the beauty and
excellence of the female character. He thought
of the absent and the dead; and said, with tears
in his eyes;
Shall I thank God for the green Summer, and
the mild air, and the flowers, and the stars, and
all that makes this world so beautiful, and not for
the good and beautiful beings I have known in it?
Has not their presence been sweeter to me than
flowers? Are they not higher and holier than the
stars? Are they not more to me than all things
else?
Thus the morning passed away in musings; and
in the afternoon, when Flemming was preparing to
go down to the lake, as his custom was, a carriage
drew up before the door, and, to his great
astonishment
,
out jumped Berkley. The first thing he
did was to give the Postmaster, who stood near
the door, a smart cut with his whip. The sufferer
gently expostulated, saying,
Pray, Sir, don't; I am lame.
Whereupon Berkley desisted, and began
instead
to shake the Postmaster's wife by the
shoulders
,
and order his dinner in English. But all this
was done so good-naturedly, and with such a rosy,
laughing face, that no offence was taken.
So you have returned much sooner than you
intended; said Flemming, after the first friendly
salutations.
Yes, replied Berkley; I got tired of Ischel,
very tired. I did not find the friends there,
whom I expected. Now I am going back to
Salzburg, and then to Gastein. There I shall
certainly find them. You must go with me.
Flemming declined the invitation; and proposed
to Berkley, that he should join him in his
excursion
on the lake.
You shall hear the grand echo of the
Falkenstein
,
said he, and behold the scene of the
Bridal Tragedy; and then we will go on as far as
the village of Saint Wolfgang, which you have
not yet seen, except across the lake.
Well, this afternoon I devote to you; for
to-morrow we part once more, and who knows
when we shall meet again?
They went down to the water's side without
farther delay; and, taking a boat with two oars,
struck across an elbow of the lake towards a
barren
rock by the eastern shore, from which a small
white monument shone in the sun.
That monument, said one of the boatmen, a
stout young lad in leather breeches, was built by
a butcher, to the glory of Saint Wolfgang, who
saved him from drowning. He was one day riding
an ox to market along the opposite bank; when
the animal taking fright, sprang into the water, and
swam over to this place, with the butcher on his
back.
And do you think he could have done this,
asked Berkley; if Saint Wolfgang had not
helped
him?
Of course not! answered leather-breeches;
and the Englishman laughed.
From this point they rowed along under the
shore to a low promontory, upon which stood
another monument, commemorating a more tragical
event.
This is the place I was speaking of, said
Flemming, as the boatmen rested on their oars.
The melancholy and singular event it
commemorates
happened more than two centuries ago.
There was a bridal party here upon the ice one
winter; and in the midst of the dance the ice
broke, and the whole merry company were
drowned
together, except the fiddlers, who were sitting
on the shore.
They looked in silence at the monument, and at
the blue quiet water, under which the bones of the
dancers lay buried, hand in hand. The
monument
is of stone, painted white, with an
over-hanging
roof to shelter it from storms. In a niche
in front is a small image of the Saviour, in a sitting
posture; and an inscription, upon a marble tablet
below, says that it was placed there by Longinus
Walther and his wife Barbara Juliana von
Hainberg
;
themselves long since peacefully crumbled
to dust, side by side in some churchyard.
That was breaking the ice with a
vengeance
!
said Berkley, as they pushed out into
the lake again; and ere long they were floating
beneath the mighty precipice of Falkenstein; a
steep wall of rock, crowned with a chapel and a
hermitage, where in days of old lived the holy
Saint Wolfgang. It is now haunted only by an
echo, so distinct and loud, that one might imagine
the ghost of the departed saint to be sitting there,
and repeating the voices from below, not word by
word, but sentence by sentence, as if he were
passing them up to the recording angel.
Ho! ho! ho! shouted Berkley; and the
sound seemed to strike the wall of stone, like the
flapping of steel plates; Ho! ho! ho! How are
you to-day, Saint Wolfgang! You infernal old
rascal! How is the Frau von Wolfgang!God
save great George the King! Damn your eyes!
Hold your tongue! Ho! ho! ha! ha! hi!
And the words were recorded above; and a
voice repeated them with awful distinctness in the
blue depths overhead, and Flemming felt in his
inmost soul the contrast between the holy heavens,
and the mockery of laughter, and the idle words,
which fall back from the sky above us and soil
not its purity.
In half an hour they were at the village of Saint
Wolfgang, threading a narrow street, above which
the roofs of quaint, picturesque old houses almost
met. It led them to a Gothic church; a
magnificent
one for a village;in front of which was
a small court, shut in by Italian-looking houses,
with balconies, and flowers at the windows. Here
a bronze fountain of elaborate workmanship was
playing in the shade. On its summit stood an
image of the patron Saint of the village; and,
running round the under lip of the water-basin
below
,
they read this inscription in old German
rhymes;
I am in the honor of Saint Wolfgang raised.
Abbot Wolfgang Habel of Emensee, he hath
made me for the use and delight of poor pilgrim
wight. Neither gold nor wine hath he; at this
water shall he merry be. In the year of the Lord
fifteen hundred and fifteen, hath the work
completed
been. God be praised!
As they were deciphering the rude characters
of this pious inscription, a village priest came
down a high flight of steps from the parsonage
near the church, and courteously saluted the
strangers. After returning the salutation, the mad
Englishman, without preface, asked him how
many
natural children were annually born in the
parish. The question seemed to astonish the
good father, but he answered it civilly, as he did
several other questions, which Flemming thought
rather indiscreet, to say the least.
You will excuse our curiosity, said he to the
priest, by way of apology. We are strangers
from distant countries. My friend is an
Englishman
and I an American.
Berkley, however, was not so easily silenced.
After a few moments' conversation he broke out
into most audacious Latin, in which the only
words clearly intelligible were;
Plurimum reverende, in Christo religiosissime,
ac clarissime Domine, necnon et amice
observandissime
!
Petrus sic est locutus; `Nec argentum
mihi, nec aurum est; sed quod habeo, hoc tibi do;
surge et ambula.'
He seemed to be speaking of the fountain.
The priest answered meekly,
Non intellexi, Domine!
But Berkley continued with great volubility to
speak of his being a stranger in the land, and all
men being strangers upon earth, and hoping to
meet the good priest hereafter in the kingdom of
Heaven. The priest seemed confounded, and
abashed. Through the mist of a strange
pronunciation
he could recognise only here and there a
familiar word. He took out his snuff-box; and
tried to quote a passage from Saint Paul;
Ut dixit Sanctus Paulus; qui bene facit
Here his memory failed him, or, as the French
say, he was at the end of his Latin, and,
stretching
forth his long forefinger, he concluded in
German;
Yes;I don'tso clearly remember
what he did say.
The Englishman helped him through with a
moral phrase; and then pulling off his hat,
exclaimed
very solemnly;
Vale, domine doctissime et reverendissime!
And the Dominie, as if pursued by a demon,
made a sudden and precipitate retreat down a
flight of steps into the street.
There! said Berkley laughing, I beat him
at his own weapons. What do you say of my
Latin?
I say of it, replied Flemming, what
Holophernes
said of Sir Nathaniel's; `Priscian a little
scratched; 't will serve.' I think I have heard
better. But what a whim! I thought I should
have laughed aloud.
They were still sitting by the bronze fountain
when the priest returned, accompanied by a short
man, with large feet, and a long blue surtout, so
greasy, that it reminded one of Polilla's in the
Spanish play, which was lined with slices of pork.
His countenance was broad and placid, but his blue
eyes gleamed with a wild, mysterious, sorrowful
expression. Flemming thought the Latin contest
was to be renewed, with more powder and heavier
guns. He was mistaken. The stranger saluted
him in German, and said, that, having heard he
was from America, he had come to question him
about that distant country, for which he was on
the point of embarking. There was nothing
peculiar
in his manner, nor in the questions he asked,
nor the remarks he made. They were the usual
questions and remarks about cities and climate,
and sailing the sea. At length Flemming asked
him the object of his journey to America. The
stranger came close up to him, and lowering his
voice, said very solemnly;
That holy man, Frederick Baraga, missionary
among the Indians at Lacroix, on Lake Superior,
has returned to his father-land, Krain; and I am
chosen by Heaven to go forth as Minister
Extraordinary
of Christ, to unite all nations and people
in one church!
Flemming almost started at the singular
earnestness
,
with which he uttered these words; and
looked at him attentively, thinking to see the face
of a madman. But the modest, unassuming look
of that placid countenance was unchanged; only
in the eyes burned a mysterious light, as if
candles
had been lighted in the brain, to magnify
the daylight there.
It is truly a high vocation, said he in reply.
But are you sure, that this is no hallucination?
Are you certain, that you have been chosen by
Heaven for this great work?
I am certain, replied the German, in a tone
of great calmness and sincerity; and, if Saint
Peter and Saint Paul should come down from
Heaven to assure me of it, my faith would be no
stronger than it now is. It has been declared to
me by many signs and wonders. I can no longer
doubt, nor hesitate. I have already heard the
voice of the Spirit, speaking to me at night; and
I know that I am an apostle; and chosen for this
work.
Such was the calm enthusiasm with which he
spoke, that Flemming could not choose but listen.
He felt interested in this strange being. There
was something awe-inspiring in the spirit that
possessed him. After a short pause he continued;
If you wish to know who I am, I can tell you
in few words. I think you will not find the story
without interest.
He then went on to relate the circumstances
recorded
in the following chapter.
CHAPTER VII.
THE STORY OF BROTHER BERNARDUS.
I was
born in the city of Stein, in the
land of Krain. My pious mother Gertrude
sang me psalms and spiritual songs in
childhood
;
and often, when I awoke in the night, I
saw her still sitting, patiently at her work by
the stove, and heard her singing those hymns
of heaven, or praying in the midnight darkness
when her work was done. It was for me she
prayed. Thus, from my earliest childhood, I
breathed the breath of pious aspirations.
Afterwards
I went to Laybach as a student of theology;
and after the usual course of study, was ordained
a priest. I went forth to the care of souls; my
own soul filled with the faith, that ere long all
people would be united in one church. Yet at
times my heart was heavy, to behold how many
nations there are who have not heard of Christ;
and how those, who are called Christians, are
divided into numberless sects, and how among
these are many who are Christians in name only.
I determined to devote myself to the great work
of the one church universal; and for this purpose,
to give myself wholly up to the study of the
Evangelists and the Fathers. I retired to the
Benedictine cloister of Saint Paul in the valley of
Lavant. The father-confessor in the nunnery of
Laak, where I then lived, strengthened me in this
resolve. I had long walked with this angel of
God in a human form, and his parting benediction
sank deep into my soul. The Prince-Abbot
Berthold
,
of blessed memory, was then head of the
Benedictine convent. He received me kindly,
and led me to the library; where I gazed with
secret rapture on the vast folios of the Christian
Fathers, from which, as from an arsenal, I was to
draw the weapons of holy warfare. In the study
of these, the year of my noviciate passed. I
became
a Franciscan friar; and took the name of
Brother Bernardus. Yet my course of life
remained
unchanged. I seldom left the cloister;
but sat in my cell, and pored over those tomes of
holy wisdom. About this time the aged confessor
in Laak departed this life. His death was made
known to me in a dream. It must have been
after
midnight, when I thought that I came into the
church, which was brilliantly lighted up. The dead
body of the venerable saint was brought in,
attended
by a great crowd. It seemed to me, that I
must go up into the pulpit and pronounce his
funeral
oration; and, as I ascended the stairs, the
words of my text came into my mind; `Blessed
in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.'
My funeral sermon ended in a strain of exultation;
and I awoke with `Amen!' upon my lips. A few
days afterwards, I heard that on that night the old
man died. After this event I became restless and
melancholy. I strove in vain to drive from me
my gloomy thoughts. I could no longer study.
VOL. II. 9
I was no longer contented in the cloister. I
even thought of leaving it.
One night I had gone to bed early, according
to my custom, and had fallen asleep. Suddenly I
was awakened by a bright and wonderful light,
which shone all about me, and filled me with
heavenly rapture. Shortly after I heard a voice,
which pronounced distinctly these words, in the
Sclavonian tongue; `Remain in the cloister!'
It was the voice of my departed mother. I was
fully awake; yet saw nothing but the bright light,
which disappeared, when the words had been
spoken. Still it was broad daylight in my
chamber
.
I thought I had slept beyond my usual hour.
I looked at my watch. It was just one o'clock
after midnight. Suddenly the daylight vanished,
and it was dark. In the morning I arose, as if
new-born, through the wonderful light, and the
words of my mother's voice. It was no dream.
I knew it was the will of God that I should stay;
and I could again give myself up to quiet study.
I read the whole Bible through once more in the
original text; and went on with the Fathers, in
chronological order. Often, after the apparition of
the light, I awoke at the same hour; and though
I heard no voice and saw no light, yet was
refreshed
with heavenly consolation.
Not long after this an important event
happened
in the cloister. In the absence of the
deacon of the Abbey, I was to preach the
Thanksgiving sermon of Harvest-home. During
the week the Prince-Abbot Berthold gave up the
ghost; and my sermon became at once a
Thanks-giving
and Funeral Sermon. Perhaps it may not
be unworthy of notice, that I was thus called to
pronounce
the burial discourse over the body of the
last reigning, spiritual Prince Abbot in Germany.
He was a man of God, and worthy of this honor.
One year after this event, I was appointed
Professor of Biblical Hermeneutics in Klagenfurt,
and left the Abbey forever. In Klagenfurt I
remained
ten years, dwelling in the same house, and
eating at the same table, with seventeen other
professors
.
Their conversation naturally suggested
new topics of study, and brought to my notice
books, which I had never before seen. One day
I heard at table, that Maurus Cappellari, a monk
of Camaldoli, had been elected Pope, under the
name of Gregory Sixteenth. He was spoken of as
a very learned man, who had written many books.
At this time I was a firm believer in the Pope's
infallibility; and when I heard these books
mentioned
,
there arose in me an irresistible longing to
read them. I inquired for them; but they were
nowhere to be had. At length I heard, that his
most important work, The Triumph of the
Holy
See, and of the Church, had been translated
into German and published in Augsburg. Ere
long the precious volume was in my hands. I
began
to read it with the profoundest awe. The
farther
I read, the more my wonder grew. The
subject
was of the deepest interest to me. I could
not lay the book out of my hand, till I had read
it through with the closest attention. Now at
length my eyes were opened. I saw before me a
monk, who had been educated in an Italian
cloister
;
who, indeed, had read much, and yet only
what was calculated to strengthen him in the
prejudices
of his childhood; and who had entirely
neglected those studies upon which a bishop should
most rely, in order to work out the salvation of
man. I perceived at the same time, that this was
the strongest instrument for battering down the
walls, which separate Christian from Christian.
I saw, though as yet dimly, the way in which the
union of Christians in the one true church was to
be accomplished. I knew not whether to be most
astonished at my own blindness, that, in all my
previous studies, I had not perceived, what the
reading of this single book made manifest to me;
or at the blindness of the Pope, who had
undertaken
to justify such follies, without perceiving that
at the same moment he was himself lying in fatal
error. But since I have learned more thoroughly
the ways of the Lord, I am now no more
astonished
at this, but pray only to Divine providence,
who so mysteriously prepares all people to be united
in one true church. I no longer believed in the
Pope's infallibility; nay, I believed even, that, to
the great injury of humanity, he lay in fatal error.
I felt, moreover, that now the time had fully come,
when I should publicly show myself, and found
in America a parish and a school, and become the
spiritual guide of men, and the schoolmaster of
children.
It was then, and on that account, that I wrote
in the Latin tongue my great work on Biblical
Hermeneutics. But in Germany it cannot be
published
.
The Austrian censor of the press cannot
find time to read it, though I think, that if I have
spent so many laborious days and sleepless nights
in writing it, this man ought likewise to find time
enough not only to read it, but to examine all the
grounds of my reasoning, and point out to me any
errors, if he can find any. Notwithstanding, the
Spirit gave me no repose, but urged me ever
mightily on to the perfection of my great work.
One morning I sat writing, under peculiar
influences
of the Spirit, upon the Confusion of Tongues,
the Division of the People, and the importance of
the study of Comparative Philology, in reference
to their union in one church. So wrapped was I
in the thought, that I came late into my
lecture-room
;
and after lecture returned to my chamber,
where I wrote till the clock struck twelve. At
dinner, one of the Professors asked if any one had
seen the star, about which so much was said.
The Professor of Physics, said, that the student
Johannes Schminke had come to him in the
greatest
haste, and besought him to go out and see
the wonderful star; but, being incredulous about it,
he made no haste, and, when they came into the
street, the star had disappeared. When I heard
the star spoken of, my soul was filled with rapture;
and a voice within me seemed to say, `The great
time is approaching; labor unweariedly in thy
work.' I sought out the student; and like Herod,
inquired diligently what time the star appeared.
He informed me, that, just as the clock was
striking
eight, in the morning, he went out of his house
to go to the college, and saw on the square a
crowd looking at a bright star. It was the very
hour, when I was writing alone in my chamber on
the importance of Comparative Philology in
bringing
about the union of all nations. I felt, that my
hour had come. Strangely moved, I walked up
and down my chamber. The evening twilight
came on. I lighted my lamp, and drew the green
curtains before the windows, and sat down to read.
But hardly had I taken the book into my hand,
when the Spirit began to move me, and urge me
then to make my last decision and resolve. I
made a secret vow, that I would undertake the
voyage to America. Suddenly my troubled
thoughts were still. An unwonted rapture filled
my heart. I sat and read till the supper bell
rang. They were speaking at table of a red
glaring
meteor, which had just been seen in the air,
southeast from Klagenfurt; and had suddenly
disappeared
with a dull, hollow sound. It was the
very moment at which I had taken my final
resolution
to leave my native land. Every great
purpose
and event of my life, seemed heralded and
attended by divine messengers; the voices of the
dead; the bright morning star, shining in the clear
sunshine; and the red meteor in the evening
twilight
.
I now began seriously to prepare for my
departure
.
The chamber I occupied, had once been
the library of a Franciscan convent. Only a thick
wall separated it from the church. In this wall
was a niche, with heavy folding-doors, which had
served the Franciscans as a repository for
prohibited
books. Here also I kept my papers, and my
great work on Biblical Hermeneutics. The
inside
of the doors was covered with horrible
caricatures
of Luther, Melancthon, Calvin, and other
great men. I used often to look at them with the
deepest melancholy, when I thought that these
great men likewise had labored upon earth, and
fought with Satan in the church. But they were
persecuted, denounced, condemned to die. So
perhaps
will it be with me. I thought of this often;
and armed myself against the fear of death. I was
in constant apprehension, lest the police should
search my chamber during my absence, and, by
9*
examining my papers, discover my doctrine and
designs. But the Spirit said to me; `Be of good
cheer; I will so blind the eyes of thy enemies,
that it shall not once occur to them to think of
thy writings.'
At length, after many difficulties and
temptations
of the Devil, I am on my way to America.
Yesterday I took leave of my dearest friend,
Gregory
Kuscher, in Hallstadt. He seemed filled with
the Spirit of God, and has wonderfully
strengthened
me in my purpose. All the hosts of heaven
looked on, and were glad. The old man kissed
me at parting; and I ascended the mountain as if
angels bore me up in their arms. Near the
summit
,
lay a newly fallen avalanche, over which, as
yet, no footsteps had passed. This was my last
temptation. `Ha!' cried I aloud, `Satan has
prepared a snare for me; but I will conquer him
with godly weapons.' I sprang over the
treacherous
snow, with greater faith than St. Peter walked
the waters of the Lake of Galilee; and came
down the valley, while the mountain peaks yet
shone in the setting sun. God smiles upon me.
I go forth, full of hopeful courage. On Christmas
next, I shall excommunicate the Pope.
Saying these words, he slowly and solemnly
took his leave, like one conscious of the great
events which await him, and withdrew with the
other priest into the church. Flemming could not
smile as Berkley did; for in the solitary, singular
enthusiast, who had just left them, he saw only
another
melancholy victim to solitude and over-labor
of the brain; and felt how painful a thing it is, thus
to become unconsciously the alms-man of other
men's sympathies, a kind of blind beggar for the
charity of a good wish or a prayer.
The sun was now setting. Silently they floated
back to Saint Gilgen, amid the cool evening
shadows. The village clock struck nine as they
landed; and as Berkley was to depart early in the
morning, he went to bed betimes. On bidding
Flemming good night he said;
I shall not see you in the morning; so good
bye, and God bless you. Remember my parting
words. Never mind trifles. In this world a man
must either be anvil or hammer. Care killed a
cat!
I have heard you say that so often, replied
Flemming, laughing, that I begin to believe it is
true. But I wonder if Care shaved his left
eyebrow
,
after doing the deed, as the ancient
Egyptians
used to do!
Aha! now you are sweeping cobwebs from
the sky! Good night! Good night!
A sorrowful event happened in the
neighbourhood
that night. The widow's child died
suddenly
.
Woe is me!thus mourns the
childless
mother in one of the funeral songs of
Greenland
;
Woe is me, that I should gaze upon thy
place and find it vacant! In vain for thee thy
mother dries the sea-drenched garments! Not
in these words, but in thoughts like these, did the
poor mother bewail the death of her child,
thinking
mostly of the vacant place, and the daily cares
and solicitudes of maternal love. Flemming saw
a light in her chamber, and shadows moving to
and fro, as he stood by the window, gazing into
the starry, silent sky. But he little thought of the
awful domestic tragedy, which was even then
enacted
behind those thin curtains!
CHAPTER VIII.
FOOT-PRINTS OF ANGELS.
It
was Sunday morning; and the church bells
were all ringing together. From all the
neighbouring
villages, came the solemn, joyful sounds,
floating through the sunny air, mellow and faint
and low,all mingling into one harmonious
chime, like the sound of some distant organ in
heaven. Anon they ceased; and the woods, and
the clouds, and the whole village, and the very air
itself seemed to pray, so silent was it
everywhere
.
Two venerable old men,high priests and
patriarchs were they in the land,went up the
pulpit stairs, as Moses and Aaron went up Mount
Hor, in the sight of all the congregation,for
the pulpit stairs were in front, and very high.
Paul Flemming will never forget the sermon he
heard that day,no, not even if he should live
to be as old as he who preached it. The text
was, I know that my Redeemer liveth. It was
meant to console the pious, poor widow, who sat
right below him at the foot of the pulpit stairs, all
in black, and her heart breaking. He said nothing
of the terrors of death, nor of the gloom of the
narrow house, but, looking beyond these things, as
mere circumstances to which the imagination
mainly
gives importance, he told his hearers of the
innocence
of childhood upon earth, and the holiness
of childhood in heaven, and how the beautiful
Lord Jesus was once a little child, and now in
heaven the spirits of little children walked with
him, and gathered flowers in the fields of
Paradise
.
Good old man! In behalf of humanity, I
thank thee for these benignant words! And, still
more than I, the bereaved mother thanked thee,
and from that hour, though she wept in secret for
her child, yet
She knew he was with Jesus,
And she asked him not again.
After the sermon, Paul Flemming walked forth
alone into the churchyard. There was no one
there, save a little boy, who was fishing with a pin
hook in a grave half full of water. But a few
moments afterward, through the arched gateway
under the belfry, came a funeral procession. At
its head walked a priest in white surplice,
chanting
.
Peasants, old and young, followed him, with
burning tapers in their hands. A young girl
carried
in her arms a dead child, wrapped in its little
winding sheet. The grave was close under the
wall, by the church door. A vase of holy water
stood beside it. The sexton took the child from
the girl's arms, and put it into a coffin; and, as he
placed it in the grave, the girl held over it a cross,
wreathed with roses, and the priest and peasants
sang a funeral hymn. When this was over, the
priest sprinkled the grave and the crowd with holy
water; and then they all went into the church,
each one stopping as he passed the grave to
throw a handful of earth into it, and sprinkle it
with holy water.
A few moments afterwards, the voice of the
priest was heard saying mass in the church, and
Flemming saw the toothless old sexton treading
the fresh earth into the grave of the little child,
with his clouted shoes. He approached him,
and asked the age of the deceased. The sexton
leaned a moment on his spade, and shrugging his
shoulders replied;
Only an hour or two. It was born in the
night, and died this morning early?
A brief existence, said Flemming. The child
seems to have been born only to be buried, and
have its name recorded on a wooden tombstone.
The sexton went on with his work, and made
no reply. Flemming still lingered among the
graves, gazing with wonder at the strange
devices
,
by which man has rendered death horrible
and the grave loathsome.
In the Temple of Juno at Elis, Sleep and his
twin-brother Death were represented as children
reposing in the arms of Night. On various funeral
monuments of the ancients the Genius of Death is
sculptured as a beautiful youth, leaning on an
inverted
torch, in the attitude of repose, his wings
folded and his feet crossed. In such peaceful and
attractive forms, did the imagination of ancient
poets and sculptors represent death. And these
were men in whose souls the religion of Nature
was like the light of stars, beautiful, but faint and
cold! Strange, that in later days, this angel of
God, which leads us with a gentle hand, into the
Land of the great departed, into the silent Land,
should have been transformed into a monstrous
and terrific thing! Such is the spectral rider on
the white horse;such the ghastly skeleton with
scythe and hour-glass;the Reaper, whose name
is Death!
One of the most popular themes of poetry
and painting in the Middle Ages, and continuing
down even into modern times, was the Dance of
Death. In almost all languages is it written,
the apparition of the grim spectre, putting a
sudden
stop to all business, and leading men away
into the remarkable retirement of the grave. It
is written in an ancient Spanish Poem, and
painted
on a wooden bridge in Switzerland. The
designs
of Holbein are well known. The most
striking among them is that, where, from a group
of children sitting round a cottage hearth, Death has
taken one by the hand, and is leading it out of the
door. Quietly and unresisting goes the little
child, and in its countenance no grief, but wonder
only; while the other children are weeping and
stretching forth their hands in vain towards their
departing brother. A beautiful design it is, in all
save the skeleton. An angel had been better,
with folded wings, and torch inverted!
And now the sun was growing high and warm.
A little chapel, whose door stood open, seemed to
invite
Flemming to enter and enjoy the grateful
coolness
.
He went in. There was no one there. The
walls were covered with paintings and sculpture of
the rudest kind, and with a few funeral tablets.
There was nothing there to move the heart to
devotion
;
but in that hour the heart of Flemming
was weak,weak as a child's. He bowed his
stubborn knees, and wept. And oh! how many
disappointed hopes, how many bitter recollections,
how much of wounded pride, and unrequited love,
were in those tears, through which he read on a
marble tablet in the chapel wall opposite, this
singular inscription;
Look not mournfully into the Past. It comes
not back again. Wisely improve the Present. It
is thine. Go forth to meet the shadowy Future,
without fear, and with a manly heart.
It seemed to him, as if the unknown tenant of
that grave had opened his lips of dust, and spoken
to him the words of consolation, which his soul
needed, and which no friend had yet spoken. In
a moment the anguish of his thoughts was still.
The stone was rolled away from the door of his
heart; death was no longer there, but an angel
clothed in white. He stood up, and his eyes were
no more bleared with tears; and, looking into
the bright, morning heaven, he said;
I will be strong!
Men sometimes go down into tombs, with
painful
longings to behold once more the faces of their
departed friends; and as they gaze upon them,
lying there so peacefully with the semblance, that
they wore on earth, the sweet breath of heaven
touches them, and the features crumble and fall
together, and are but dust. So did his soul then
descend for the last time into the great tomb of
the Past, with painful longings to behold once
more the dear faces of those he had loved; and
the sweet breath of heaven touched them, and
they would not stay, but crumbled away and
perished
as he gazed. They, too, were dust. And
thus, far-sounding, he heard the great gate of the
Past shut behind him as the Divine Poet did the
gate of Paradise, when the angel pointed him the
way up the Holy Mountain; and to him likewise
was it forbidden to look back.
In the life of every man, there are sudden
transitions of feeling, which seem almost
miraculous
.
At once, as if some magician had touched
the heavens and the earth, the dark clouds melt
into the air, the wind falls, and serenity succeeds
the storm. The causes which produce these
sudden
changes may have been long at work within us,
but the changes themselves are instantaneous, and
apparently without sufficient cause. It was so with
Flemming; and from that hour forth he resolved,
that he would no longer veer with every shifting
wind of circumstance; no longer be a child's
plaything
in the hands of Fate, which we ourselves do
make or mar. He resolved henceforward not to
lean on others; but to walk self-confident and
self-possessed
;
no longer to waste his years in vain
regrets, nor wait the fulfilment of boundless hopes
and indiscreet desires; but to live in the Present
wisely, alike forgetful of the Past, and careless of
what the mysterious Future might bring. And
from that moment he was calm, and strong; he
was reconciled with himself! His thoughts turned
to his distant home beyond the sea. An
indescribable
,
sweet feeling rose within him.
Thither will I turn my wandering footsteps,
said he; and be a man among men, and no
longer a dreamer among shadows. Henceforth be
mine a life of action and reality! I will work in
my own sphere, nor wish it other than it is. This
alone is health and happiness. This alone is
Life;
`Life that shall send
A challenge to its end,
And when it comes, say, Welcome, friend!'
Why have I not made these sage reflections, this
wise resolve, sooner? Can such a simple result
spring only from the long and intricate process
of experience? Alas! it is not till Time, with
reckless hand, has torn out half the leaves from the
Book of Human Life, to light the fires of passion
with, from day to day, that Man begins to see,
that the leaves which remain are few in number,
and to remember, faintly at first, and then more
clearly, that, upon the earlier pages of that book,
was written a story of happy innocence, which he
would fain read over again. Then come listless
irresolution, and the inevitable inaction of despair;
or else the firm resolve to record upon the leaves
that still remain, a more noble history, than the
child's story, with which the book began.
CHAPTER IX.
THE LAST PANG.
Farewell
to thee, Saint Gilgen! said
Flemming
,
as he turned on the brow of the hill, to take
his last look at the lake and the village below, and
felt that this was one of the few spots on the wide
earth to which he could say farewell with regret.
Thy majestic hills have impressed themselves
upon my soul, as a seal upon wax. The quiet
beauty of thy lake shall be to me forever an image
of peace and purity and stillness, and that
inscription
in thy little churchyard, a sentence of wisdom
for my after life.
Before the setting of the same sun, which then
shone on that fair landscape, he was far on his
way towards Munich. He had left far behind
him the mountains of the Tyrol; and beheld them
for the last time in the soft evening twilight, their
bases green with forest trees, and here and there,
a sharp rocky spire, and a rounded summit capped
with snow. There they lay, their backs, like the
backs of camels; a mighty caravan, reposing at
evening in its march across the desert.
From Munich he passed through Augsburg and
Ulm, on his way to Stuttgard. At the entrances
of towns and villages, he saw large crucifixes;
and on the fronts of many houses, coarse paintings
and images of saints. In Gunzburg three priests
in black were slowly passing down the street, and
women fell on their knees to receive their blessing.
There were many beggars, too, in the streets;
and an old man who was making hay in a field by
the road-side, when he saw the carriage
approaching
,
threw down his rake, and came tumbling over
the ditch, with his hat held out in both hands,
uttering the most dismal wail. The next day, the
bright yellow jackets of the postilions, and the
two great tassels of their bugle-horns, dangling
down their backs, like two cauliflowers, told him
he was in Wrtemberg; and, late in the evening,
VOL. II. 10
he stopped at a hotel in Stuttgard; and from his
chamber-window, saw, in the bright moonlight, the
old Gothic cathedral, with its narrow, lancet
windows
and jutting buttresses, right in front of him.
Ere long he had forgotten all his cares and
sorrows
in sleep, and with them his hopes, and
wishes
,
and good resolves.
He was still sitting at breakfast in his chamber,
the next morning, when the great bell of the
cathedral
opposite began to ring, and reminded him
that it was Sunday. Ere long the organ answered
from within, and from its golden lips breathed forth
a psalm. The congregation began to assemble,
and Flemming went up with them to the house of
the Lord. In the body of the church he found
the pews all filled or locked; they seemed to
belong
to families. He went up into the gallery,
and looked over the psalm-book of a peasant,
while the congregation sang the sublime old hymn
of Martin Luther,
Our God, he is a tower of strength,
A trusty shield and weapon.
During the singing, a fat clergyman, clad in black,
with a white surplice thrown loosely about him,
came pacing along one of the aisles, from beneath
the organ-loft and ascended the pulpit. After the
hymn, he read a portion of Scripture, and then
said;
Let us unite in silent prayer.
And turning round, he knelt in the pulpit, while
the congregation remained standing. For a while
there was a breathless silence in the church, which
to Flemming was more solemnly impressive than
any audible prayer. The clergyman then arose,
and began his sermon. His theme was the
Reformation
;
and he attempted to prove how much
easier it was to enter the kingdom of Heaven
through the gateways of the Reformed
Evangelical
Dutch church, than by the aisles and
penitential
stair-cases of Saint Peter's. He then gave
a history of the Reformation; and, when
Flemming
thought he was near the end, he heard him
say, that he should divide his discourse into four
heads. This reminded him of the sturdy old
Puritan
,
Cotton Mather, who after preaching an hour,
would coolly turn the hour-glass on the pulpit, and
say; Now, my beloved hearers, let us take
another
glass. He stole out into the silent,
deserted
street, and went to visit the veteran sculptor
Dannecker. He found him in his parlour, sitting
alone, with his psalm-book, and the reminiscences
of a life of eighty years. As Flemming entered,
he arose from the sofa, and tottered towards him;
a venerable old man, of low stature, and dressed
in a loose white jacket, with a face like Franklin's,
his white hair flowing over his shoulders, and a
pale, blue eye.
So you are from America, said he. But
you have a German name. Paul Flemming was
one of our old poets. I have never been in
America
,
and never shall go there. I am now too old. I
have been in Paris and in Rome. But that was
long ago. I am now eight and seventy years
old.
Here he took Flemming by the hand, and made
him sit down by his side, on the sofa. And
Flemming
felt a mysterious awe creep over him, on
touching the hand of the good old man, who sat
so serenely amid the gathering shade of years, and
listened to life's curfew-bell, telling, with eight and
seventy solemn strokes, that the hour had come,
when the fires of all earthly passion must be
quenched within, and man must prepare to lie
down and rest till the morning.
You see, he continued, in a melancholy tone,
my hands are cold; colder than yours. They
were warmer once. I am now an old man.
Yet these are the hands, answered
Flemming
,
that sculptured the beauteous Ariadne
and the Panther. The soul never grows old.
Nor does Nature, said the old man, pleased
with this allusion to his great work, and pointing
to the green trees before his window. This
pleasure I have left to me. My sight is still good.
I can even distinguish objects on the side of
yonder
mountain. My hearing is also unimpaired.
For all which, I thank God.
10*
Then, directing Flemming's attention to a fine
engraving, which hung on the opposite wall of the
room, he continued;
That is an engraving of Canova's Religion. I
love to sit here and look at it, for hours together.
It is beautiful. He made the statue for his native
town, where they had no church, until he built
them one. He placed the statue in it. This
engraving
he sent me as a present. Ah, he was a
dear, good man. The name of his native town I
have forgotten. My memory fails me. I cannot
remember names.
Fearful that he had disturbed the old man in his
morning devotions, Flemming did not remain long,
but took his leave with regret. There was
something
impressive in the scene he had witnessed;
this beautiful old age of the artist; sitting by the
open window, in the bright summer morning,
the labor of life accomplished, the horizon reached,
where heaven and earth meet,thinking it was
angel's music, when he heard the church-bells ring;
himself too old to go. As he walked back to his
chamber, he thought within himself, whether he
likewise might not accomplish something, which
should live after him;might not bring something
permanent out of this fast-fleeting life of man, and
then sit down, like the artist, in serene old age,
and fold his hands in silence. He wondered how
a man felt when he grew so old, that he could no
longer go to church, but must sit at home and read
the bible in large print. His heart was full of
indefinite longings, mingled with regrets; longings
to accomplish something worthy of life; regret,
that as yet he had accomplished nothing, but had
felt and dreamed only. Thus the warm days in
spring bring forth passion-flowers and
forget-me-nots
.
It is only after mid-summer, when the days
grow shorter and hotter, that fruit begins to
appear
.
Then, the heat of the day brings forward
the harvest, and after the harvest, the leaves fall,
and there is a gray frost. Much meditating upon
these things, Paul Flemming reached his hotel.
At that moment a person clad in green came
down the church-steps, and crossed the street. It
was the German student, of Interlachen.
Flemming
started as if a green snake had suddenly
crossed his path. He took refuge in his chamber.
That night as he was sitting alone in his
chamber
,
having made his preparation to depart the
following morning, his attention was arrested by
the sound of a female voice in the next room. A
thin partition, with a door, separated it from his
own. He had not before observed that the room
was occupied. But, in the stillness of the night,
the tones of that voice struck his ear. He
listened
.
It was a lady, reading the prayers of the
English Church. The tones were familiar; and
awakened at once a thousand painfully sweet
recollections. It was the voice of Mary
Ashburton
!
His heart could not be deceived; and all its
wounds began to bleed afresh, like those of a
murdered
man, when the murderer approaches. His
first impulse was of affection only, boundless,
irrepressible
,
delirious, as of old in the green valley of
Interlachen. He waited for the voice to cease;
that he might go to her, and behold her face once
more. And then his pride rose up within him,
and rebuked this weakness. He remembered his
firm resolve; and blushed to find himself so
feeble
.
And the voice ceased; and yet he did not
go. Pride had so far gained the mastery over
affection
.
He lay down upon his bed, like a child
as he was. All about him was silence, and the
silence was holy, for she was near; so near that
he could almost hear the beating of her heart.
He knew now for the first time how weak he was,
and how strong his passion for that woman. His
heart was like the altar of the Israelites of old;
and, though drenched with tears, as with rain, it
was kindled at once by the holy fire from heaven!
Towards morning he fell asleep, exhausted with
the strong excitement; and, in that hour when,
sleep being nigh unto the soul, visions are
deemed prophetic, he dreamed. O blessed vision
of the morning, stay! thou wert so fair! He
stood again on the green sunny meadow, beneath
the ruined towers; and she was by his side, with
her pale, speaking countenance and holy eyes;
and he kissed her fair forehead; and she turned her
face towards him beaming with affection and said,
I confess it now; you are the Magician! and
pressed him in a meek embrace, that he, might
rather feel than see the swelling of her heart.
And then she faded away from his arms, and her
face became transfigured, and her voice like the
voice of an angel in heaven;and he awoke, and
was alone!
It was broad daylight; and he heard the
postilion
,
and the stamping of horses' hoofs on the
pavement at the door. At the same moment his
servant came in, with coffee, and told him all was
ready. He did not dare to stay. But, throwing
himself into the carriage, he cast one look towards
the window of the Dark Ladie, and a moment
afterwards
had left her forever! He had drunk the
last drop of the bitter cup, and now laid the golden
goblet gently down, knowing that he should behold
it no more!
No more! O how majestically mournful are
those words! They sound like the roar of the
wind through a forest of pines!
