LEISLER.
CHAPTER I.
DESERTION OF THE CITADEL OF YORK.
Bits
of history in a novel, especially at
the outset, we very well know, are by no
means relished by novel-readers, who
generally like to open at once upon the
action of the story. But it is sometimes
necessary, particularly when a romance
is based upon an interesting historical
incident, to lay before the reader a brief
outline of the events upon which the tale
hangs. It is better, we think, to do this
at the outset, in a fair and above-board
manner, than open with an interesting
scene, and before the reader has got half
a dozen pages, smuggle in two or three
solid
pages of history, through which he
must flounder, or take them at a flying
leap. We don't like this mode of
cheating
our friends, so we place our history
in the fore-ground, that it may be fairly
met at the outset.
But we will only detain the reader for
a few sentences, prefacing the story with
no more than is absolutely necessary to
make it intelligibly understood.
The scenes of the tale are laid so far
back as 1689, when New York, under
the name of New Amsterdam, was quite
as much a Dutch town as it
subsequently
became an English one.
The reign of the
Catholic
James II.
sowed the seeds of disunion and civil
trouble in his province of New York, as
well as at home. Resolved to establish
the religion of Rome throughout his
dominions
,
he appointed every where in
the colonies Roman Catholic governors.
New York, in Dongan, had a Catholic
governor placed over her, who appointed
sub-officers of the same faith. Around
him, during his administration, there
formed a cabal of men of the Roman
religion
,
who held all the influence of the
province in their hands. The Protestant
gentlemen of figure, whether English of
the Church of England or Dutch of the
Reformed Church, were alike deprived
of power and consideration, and
rendered
cyphers in the colony. Roman
Catholic
influence and power predominated.
The administration of the affairs of the
province was characterized by a decided
and undisguised hostility to the
Protestant
citizeus, whom the governor and his
minions oppressed in every way whereby
they could frame an excuse for laying
their hands upon them. The least
remonstrance
on the part of a Protestant
was punished with rigor. Among others
who suffered for manly resistance to
this tyranny was Jacob Leisler, a
gentleman
of property, a merchant of influence
and wealth, who owned many ships, and
who, by his enterprize and intelligence,
was founder of that vast commerce of
New York, which now extends its wings
over every sea of the globe. For an act
of firm resistance to the injustice of the
governor, he was thrown into prison,
where he was long detained, and heavily
fined.
These proceedings rendered the
government
of the Roman Catholic rulers
in the province hateful in the eyes of the
Protestants, both English and Dutch,
and among the poor as well as the rich.
This state of things continued until
Dongan, for fear of an insurrection, and
alarmed for his life, surrendered his
authority
into the hands of Nicholson, his
lieutenant-governor, and retired on board
a ship in the harbor.
But the people derived no benefit by
this resignation. It was one tyrant
exchanged
for another. At length Andross,
who held under King James the
government
of New England, was deposed by a
successful rebellion at Boston, where had
been the principal seat of a despotism of
a similar character. He was imprisoned
by the indignant colonists with his
notorious
agent, Randolph.
Nicholson, hearing of this revolution
and overthrow of Andross, began to
tremble for his own; for a rumor
reached
him with the alarming intelligence
that the people of England were about to
rise and dethrone his master, James II.,
and offer the crown of England to
William
,
Prince of Orange.
This news filled the Protestant
inhabitants
of New York with great joy, and
they began to take courage and unite
themselves secretly for the purpose of
following
the example set them in Boston.
Nicholson, suspecting this combination,
threw himself into the fort; when a
vessel
arriving, brought the news of the
invasion
of England by the Prince of
Orange, and the accession of William
and Mary to the throne.
The citizens at once waited upon him
and desired to know whether he would
recognize the authority of the Protestant
King and Queen. But this he
absolutely
refused to do; and becoming alarmed
at the stern excitement of the people, and
remembering the fate of Andross, he
embarked
from the fort in the night, and
rowed on board a ship, thus deserting his
government.
The next morning early the rumor of
the departure of the lieutenant-governor
spread throughout the town, and the bells
were rang to call the people together.
They assembled soon to the number of
several hundreds in an open place
between
the Trinity Church and the Fort.
To a man they were Protestants, the
Roman
Catholics keeping their houses, and
some of them, who were the chief men
under Nicholson, hiding themselves.
How the rumor got about that the
governor
had fled no one knew, nor could any
one say who had ordered the bells to be
rung. But joy and animation were
upon
every face; and though the people
were assembled in this sudden and
apparently
tumultuous manner, without a
leader, there was the utmost order
prevailing
.
Each man looked to his neighbour for
the confirmation of the truth of the words
that were still flying through the streets,
and which the church bells, in tongues
almost as articulate as the voices of men,
were proclaiming:
`The Papist has fled! Long live
William
and Mary!'
These were the words commingled with
the loud clangor of bells, that broke upon
the stillness of the morning repose of the
town and started every man from his bed;
the protestant to clothe and arm himself
and hasten to the Parade above the fort;
the Catholic to bar his doors and await in
silence the issue.
At length, when the multitude had as
sembled and each was looking round for
a speaker or some master spirit of the
hour, a tall, well-built gentleman, in a
plain olive-brown velvet coat, very white
powdered hair and about forty six years
of age, stood up above their heads on a
broken gun-carriage which lay upon the
parade. There was an air of
respectability
in his appearance, and his mouth
and brow indicated firmness combined
with benevolence of character. His eye
was sparkling with animation, and his
cheek flushed as he gazed around for a
moment upon the sea of heads beneath
him.
`Jacob Leisler! Jacob Leisler!'
shouted
a hundred voices as soon as he was
discovered. His name was then
repeated
from lip to lip in tones of satisfaction
which clearly showed, that in that
moment
of disorganization each man of
them looked to him with confidence as
one to advise and guide them.
The scene was singularly exciting. At
least four thousand men, young and old,
were condensed within a space which
just contained them. Lesiler towered
above the slender spire of Old
Trinity
chapel, the beams of the rising sun just
gilding its vane. On the left flowed the
majestic Hudson, shining like a mirror,
and beyond spread the woodland and
green shores of Jersey. North, extended
Broadway, in the direction of the Park,
which was then a common surrounded by
woodland. East of him ran Wall street
to the water side, nearly every house in
it having shade trees before it and a
stoope
before the door. In the rear of the south
row of houses, was still visible part of the
ancient wall, which had been once the
northern limits of the town. South of
him, about a musket shot distant from
where the battery now is, was the Fort,
a strong word for that day, formidable
with cannon couching in embrazures and
and pointing towards the parade, filled
with the multitude. In the windows and
upon the roofs of the dwellings
overlooking
the square were women and children,
almost equalling in numbers their
husbands
and fathers that thronged the area.
`My friends and fellow citizens,' began
Leisler, as soon as the enthusiasm which
hailed his sppearance had given way to
a deep, listening silence, `you have been
called together by the sound of bells and
cries that Nicholson has fled to a ship in
the harbor. Some of you about me doubt
the good newsit is in my power to
confirm
itit was by my command that the
bells were rung to call you together.
About an hour ago, or little less I
received
at my house a messenger from
Robert
Logan, the nephew of the late
Governor
and Secretary to Nichelson, a young
man whom you all full well know,
informing
me that the Lieutenant
Governor
had taken a boat and vacated the
government
,
leaving the fortress in his
command
,
he refusing to go.'
`The letter! Read us the letter!' cried
several voices from different qurrters of
the parade.
Jacob Leisler then unfolded the letter
and gave it a young man near him saiying
`Read it! It is too complimentary for
me to give it voice!' In a loud and
distinct
tone the young man, who was short
and fat, and who had been a
burgomaster
,
read as follows:
Fort York,
May, 1689.
Sir: Knowing that you possess no
little
influence and the confidence of the
Protestant citizens, and believing that a
communication to you will be the same
as to them in the aggregate, I proceed to
inform you that Lieutenant Colonel
Nictolson
;
late acting Governor of this
Province
,
under a commission from King
James II, having refused to acknowledge
the authority of William, the Prince of
Orange, has seen fit to abdicate his
government
.
He has this night past
embarked
on board a Swedish ship now in the
harbor, and will sail at once for Europe.
It was his desire that I should accompany
him; but as it does not suit my purposes
to quit the Province just now, I remain.
Now herewith I propose to surrender the
post and all appertaining to it to you, for
the sum of ten thousand pounds;
otherwise
I shall defend it with the soldiers
that are in it, against you and yours to
to the last extremity.
Yours respectfully
Robert Logan
.
P S. I shall give you until noon to
decide whether you will save
blood-sheding
or no.'
When this letter had been read there
was a deep murmur heard throughout the
multitude; a murmur of mingled surprise
and disapprobation.
`It is like that mad-cap, Robert
Logan
,'
said one.
`Nicholson is surely gone,' remarked
another, with satisfaction.
`Yes,' said a third, `the province is
free of the Papist and Pope. Long live
William and Mary!'
`Long live the king and queen!'
shouted a thousand voices as the
confirmation
of their freedom from papal
tyranny
was full received into their minds.
`No money! not a penny! Down
with the myrmidons of James. We will
give them steel instead of gold,' cried
others.
`No, no; let us hear what Jacob Leis
ler has to say,' suggested some more
moderate among the crowd. `See he is
about to speak to us!'
`Aye, aye! He is a good man and
true. We will hear him.'
A number of the principal protestant
gentlemen present now called on Mr.
Lesiler to advise them what course it was
expedient to take, now that the Province
was literally without government; and
although there was the same mayor and
city officers and city government, which
held office under Nicholson and Dongan,
yet so sudden had been this popular
movement that they had no sooner heard
in their houses the commotion without,
than they feared to stir forth out of their
doors.
`I am but a private citizen, my friends,'
answered Leisler. `I am not capable of
advising you in a crisis like the present.
As soon as I got this letter from Mr.
Logan
,
I sent to give notice to the town by
the ringing of bells, as much for
rejoicing
at the departure of Governor
Nicholson after Dongan as to get you
together
speedily. Having done this and
read to you the letter, I leave you to
take such measures as you deem
expedient
.
You shall have my voice, like
that of another, in your deliberations!'
`There is no one so capable of
advising
or guiding us in this emergency as
Jacob Leisler,' was the cry of all within
hearing of his voice.
`I am willing to do what I can to
serve you,' he answered as if shrinking
from assuming the responsibility at such
a time. `My advice is that the young
gentleman, Mr Logan be waited on by a
deputation of the citizens, and required
to surrender the fort without any
conditions
,
but granting him his liberty and
that of the soldiers, disarming them,
however
,
so that they may do no mischief.
It is probable that the soldiers will be
ready to acknowledge the new reign, as
they live by the crown whatsoever head
it be upon.'
This adivce was well received by the
people; and a deputation consisting of
seven citizens was despatched to the gate
of the fort, and demanded audience with
Robert Logan. This person appeared
over the gate-way and looking down upon
them, inquired who they were and what
they desired.
He was a gay young man, not more
than six or seven and twenty, of good
figure and face, richly dressed, with a
sword by his side and two pistols in his
belt. His face wore a reckless, fearless
air, as if he defied the burghesses and all
the power they could bring against him;
though he had not seventy soldiers with
him to hold the fortress.
`We are come hither, master Roberts
Logan,' said the chief man of the
deputation
,
a stout Dutch linen-draper of
substance
,
`to requires you for to surrenders
the vort midout delays!'
`Do you bring ten thousand pounds in
your pouch, Mynheer Van Vow?' asked
Robert Logan.
`We bring notings but what I said,'
answered the citizen flushed at the
coolness
of the young Englishman.
`Then I shall keep the fort. Where
is Leisler?'
`Mr. Leisler is on the green amongs
the peoples,' answered another of the
deputation
.
`Send him hither! He is your chief
man, and I will confer with him.'
`Mister Jacob Leisler has now no
powers to speaks with you,' responded
Mynheer Van Vow. `We are sent by
the peoples!'
`Then go back, Mynheer, to the
peoples
,
and tell them that I will treat with
no other man than Jacob Leisler!'
This was spoken in a very peremptory
way, and the Dutch committee saw that
their only course was to obey. So they
walked back to the `peoples' and
reported
the issue of their mission.
Thereupon, after considerable warmth
of debate between the English citizens
and Dutch citizens present, the former
proposing to attack the fort and carry it
by storm without delay, and hang Logan
over the gateway, the latter advocating
forboarance, Jacob Leslier was sent alone.
Upon arriving at the gate, Robert Logan,
instead of addressing him from the
platform
above it, came down and opened it
to him, inviting him to enter.
`Nay, sir, I am safer outside, good
Master Logan,' answered the merchant
smiling.
`Do not fear treachery from me, sir!
But as you will not go in, I will speak
with you outside as we walk up and
down!'
So together, side by side they paced to
and fro a small paved space in front of
the gate being about ten feet distant from
it; and that he might not be overheard,
Logan bade the sentry to step within the
wicket.
All this was seen from the parade, and
there was no little wonder manifested at
this boldness of the young man, and
curiosity
to know what he could propose to
their rich townsman.
`You received my note this morning,
Mr. Leisler?' observed Logan.
`Yes,' answered the merchant firmly;
`and on receiving kept not the news five
minutes. Thus, you see, I was resolved
to be no secret correspondent of yours.
I set the bells a-ringing, and have, as you
see, got the town together!'
`You have been diligent;' answered
the young man, with a sneer. `What
said the people to my proposition, if you
read it to them, as doubtless you did, for
I saw something like a letter in your
hand?'
`They scorn your proposal, sir! In
a word, Mr. Logan, you are getting to
yourself little credit for presuming to
maintain this fort after it has been
abandoned
by the lawful Governor of the
Province
.
You have not the least shadow
of authority by which to hold it. In my
eyes, in the eyes of the citizensand
you will be in the King's, when he hears
of this day's worka rebel and pirate!'
`Your Orange King's authority has
not yet reached here. The provincial
government under James is terminated.
Until fresh authority and powers arrive I
have as much right to hold this fort as
you or any other man!'
`There is some plausibility in this
reasoning; but
we
should hold it for King
William, you for a fallen and dead
power
!'
`No, I hold it for the Pope!'
answered
the young man emphatically.
Leisler turned and surveyed his face
with astonishment, to see if he were in
jest or earnest. But he could not decide,
for Robert Logan's countenance was
immoveable
.
`For the Pope?'
`Yes, sir. I nor no other son of the
church has power to surrender a
stronghold
,
encharged to us by a good Catholic
monarch, without the Pope's permission.
But hear me, sir! I have not sent for
you to argue, but to propose.'
`You need not expect any money, sir.'
`Nor do I wish it, if I can get what is
dearer to you than money.'
`What can you speak of that is dearer
to me than money?' demanded Jacob
Leisler, with surprise.
`Your fair daughter, Bertha,'
answered
Logan, impressing and fixing his keen
bright eye upon the face of the wealthy
citizen. He saw that it deepened to a
flush of anger and amazement, and that
his words had both alarmed and
displeased
.
`My daughter, Mr. Logan!'
`Yes, sir. I have often seen her trip
ping by your side to conventicle, and the
glances of her love-warm eyes have
melted
my bosom.'
`What! hast thou spoken with
Bertha
?'
asked the merchant, with anxious
suspicion.
`No, save as I have said, with the eyes.
In this way we have discoursed.'
`God forbid! Did she look kindly
upon thee?'
`Stealthily and curiously only, as
maidens
are wont to regard a young
gentleman
above them in degree.'
`If she is beneath thee, it little does
thee honor to seek to get her graces.'
`Nor have I done so. I have
worshipped
her only afar off. Now I know not
what favor the fair Bertha might bestow
upon my suit; but I love her with all my
heart? and I have sent for you to say
that I will surrender the fort into your
hands if you will promise to give me your
influence with your sweet daughter.'
`No, Master Logan. My daughter
cannot love, neither can she marry a
Papist
.
You ask what I will never assent
to. Besides, I intend to betroth her to
Slems Van Vow, the young
Burgomaster
!'
`It would be to cast a pearl before a
hog, Mr. Leisler! She can never love
such a lump of vanity and fat as that rich
young Mynheer Slems!'
`Bertha already favors him; at least
he says so.'
`He is a braggart. If a maiden but
look and laugh
at
him, as every sensible
maid would do, he forthwith takes it for
a sign of love. He has not wit enough
to know when he is made a fool of.'
`I did not come hither,' answered
Jacob
Leisler, looking as if he did not
relish
this free way of discussing his
proposed
son-in-law,`to talk about the
burgomaster, but to know whether you
intend to surrender the fort without more
delay.'
`I have told you my terms. Nothing
less than your daughter!'
`I would sooner see you and your fort
blown into the air,' answered Jacob
Leisler
indignantly.
`Very well; then I shall consider that
if I win the fair Bertha after this fair
warning to you that I love her, that you
will have no cause of complaint; so,
good Sir Merchant, keep a sharp eye on
your pretty daughter, and make Slems
Van Vow the watch-dog. If you refuse
her to me fairly, I will take her in spite
of thee!'
`Do you menace me, sir!'
`No; I but tell thee a secret.'
`Do you yield the fort?'
`No!'
`Shall I bear this message to the
citizens
?'
`Yes,' answered Logan, turning to
reenter
the gateway of the citadel.
CHAPTER II.
THE SURRENDER AND POSSESSION.
Upon approaching the gate Logan saw,
to his surprise, that it had been closed
from within during his conversation with
Jacob Leisler. The suspicion that it
might have been done purposely by some
traitors flashed upon his mind. But he
resolved to ascertain without betraying
his suspicions, and striking upon the
gate, he cried,
`Come, my masters, open and admit
me. Don't you see my interview is
ended?'
`Aye, we see that, Captain Robert,'
responded a man showing his face at a
little slide four inches square which he
opened at the side of the door; `we see
that your interview has ended, and so has
your command here!'
`How so, fellow?' he demanded,
turning
pale. `What means this jest? Open,
Sergeant Graff, and let me in!'
`No, no, master. We know when we
are wise! We have no notion of bein'
cooped up here to be besieged, and by
and by starved to death or hung. We
serve the king whoever he is. It is from
the crown's purse that our pay and the
money comes that buys our rations. So
we have resolved, seeing we have you on
the outside, to keep you there and give
up the fort. Come, comrades, let us
shout for William and Mary!'
A loud huzza rose from the bosom of
the fortress in answer to his call. Thrice
it rent the air, and then three pieces of
cannon were discharged by some of the
more enthusiastic of the soldiers, the
reverberation
shaking the town.
Fortunately
they were elevated so that the shot
passed high above the heads of the crowd
and did no mischief save among the trees
in the woods north of the city.
The people, who were too far off to
know the reason of the shouting, and yet
believing that it was for William and
Mary, and hearing the shot roar above
their heads were thrown into the wildest
confusion; a part rushing towards the
fort with cries of vengeance, others flying
into the side streets to escape the effects
of any further shot from this summary
cannonading.
Jacob Leisler had not got so far from
the gate of the fort after he parted from
Logan but that he distinctly heard and
understood all that passed between him
and the sergeant.. He stopped, therefore,
with surprise, to await the issne; and it
was with no little joy that he witnessed
the firm resolution of the stout man at
arms to refuse admittance to his
unqualified
commander. As the shouts and
hurrahs burst upon the air his heart
leaped
with joyful emotion, and his
three-cornered
hat waved in the air with zeal.
Looking at Logan he saw that he stood
by the gate amazed, yet with a look of
determined courage. He was advancing
towards him when the discharge of the
cannon from the embrasures directly
above his head and the shouts of alarm
and rage from the people on the green
arrested him. He caught the meaning
of their words as they came down upon
the fort with brandished arms and cries
of revenge.
For an instant he hesitated whether to
follow his original intention of arresting
Logan or turn back the multitude. But
as he saw them close at hand, and
fearing
the worst from their misconception
of the state of things he hastened towards
them, gesticulating and calling to them.
`Hold, citizens! You are in error!
The shouts and firing were for William
and Mary! The fort has surrendered!'
These words were comprehended by
the persons in advance of their fellows,
who checked their course, repeating them
to those behind till the whole mass echoed
the cry and came to a full stand. Jacob
Leisler who stood elevated upon the low
glacis in front of the fort, so that he could
see over their heads, made a sign that he
wished to be heard. A deep silence
followed
the late uproar, like a calm after
the hoarse howling of the tempestuous
sea.
`Citizens, the firing and shouts which
you fancied were hostile were for the
crown. The guns were unfortunately
shotted, but no mischief, I trust, has been
done. The fort has submitted to a man
voluntarily; for while I was listening to
terms from Robert Logan, as you saw,
they closed the gate upon him and
refused
to admit him again; and to show
their sincerity, they shouted for the
Prince. Now, my friends, we will take
quiet possession of the fort, letting such
of the soldiers remain as see fit; the rest
shall be deprived of their arms and
follow
such civil pursuits as they shall
choose. We will select from our
number
fifty good men and true, and with
them man and maintain the citadel. We
will then be guided as wisdom and
prudence
dictate, as to the further
disposition
of the government, until a
commissioned
governor arrives from England
with full authority.'
This address was received by the
multitude
with decided approbation. A mah
who had been in the rear now forced
himself in advance and called out,
`True ant honest protestants, which
are, I doubt not all ov you who hear me,
you have heard our goot Mynheer Jacop
Leslier what he haf said. You shout that
what he says is goot! Now I make a
motion
tat we gif him te commands ov te
fort wit fifty mens to keep it.
`We could not have better mens,'
resounded
a large number of voices. `We
will have Jacob Leisler to be our captain
general.'
`Our governor!' shouted a little Slems
Van Vow, who had before spoken; `he
should pe our governor! we cannot have
a petter.'
`No, no!' answered Jacob Leisler,
completely taken by surprise. `No, no,
good friends; I cannot be your governor;
I am willing to take the fort with fifty
citizens and keep it for the governor that
shall be sent, and so protect it from the
hands of the papists, who, if they should
get it into their possession, may do us a
mischief. If fifty brave men will now
come out from among you, I will readily
take possession of the fort, letting the
soldiers who have so freely surrendered
it go their own way.'
`With the exception of catholics!'
called
out the fat young burgomaster.
`Aye, aye, let no catholic go free,' was
the response of the mass of the people.
`I will do what is just and right,'
answered
Leisler, who, in spite of himself
found himself most reluctantly assuming
a responsibility for which neither his
mercantile
habits nor his energy of
character
fitted him. Yet all men seemed, as by
one voice, to fix upon him as the only
man suited to take the lead in such an
emergency. Although, it did not occur
to him, at the moment, yet his accepting
the command of the fort and therefore of
the military force of the Province, was in
part assuming the government; for there
being no civil administration, he who
commanded the soldiery held the reins
of power. In fact, the moment he
consented
to enter and hold the citadel, that
moment he was captain general of the
colony, at the head of a military
government
;
and a power, too, as truly without
authority as that which Robert Logan had
taken into his hands.
The fifty men, armed and ready to
obey, were soon chosen from the citizens
and drawn up by the merchant-soldier,
in front of the fortress. He now, for the
first time, bethought himself of Logan,
from whom his attention had been
diverted
by the necessity of checking the
advauce
of the infuriated populace.
But in the excitement of the moment
Logan, seeing the danger of his situation,
and aware that he had not a moment to
lose in providing for his personal safety,
glided round the angle of the tower
within
which stood the gate, and darting into
the fosse followed it swiftly to its outlet
by the shore on the harbor side of the
fort. Here he was out of the sight of his
enemies whose voices, however, reached
his ears. There was a boat lying not far
from the mouth of the fosse which he
took possession of, and began to pull
rapidly
out in the direction of the Swedish
ship, on board of which were both, the
governor and lieutenant governor.
But to his surprise, he had not pulled
but a few yards from the shore when he
saw the ship spread her sails and stand
down the harbour.
`They have heard the firing and
shouting
,
and the governor's fears have driven
him off. Well, let them go,' he said; `I
did not intend to sail with them, but only
remain on board till this excitement, that
has got these folks ashore by the ears,
subsides a little. No, no, I can't leave
the colony and leave in it the fair Bertha
Leisler. The ship sails bravely away!
I shall have nothing to do then but to
pull into some fisherman's cabin on one
of the islands, and there wait the turn
of affairs.'
He pulled steadily on, his face towards
the citadel, which was still partly
enveloped
in the smoke from the cannon. At
intervals the shouts of the populace came
clearly across the water, for the air was
very light where he was, though in the
lower harbour the ship had a five knot
breeze.
The islands in the harbour of
New-York
,
were not then as at the present day,
cultivated and adorned with villas or
public
edifices, Many of them were
wooded
,
and at a distance were mountainous
masses of foliage lifting themselves above
the waters of the bay. Some of them
were cleared here and there, showing
bright spots of verdure or patches of rich
brown loam, with a hut near the water.
These were the dwelling places of
fishermen
;
who ran seaward every morning to
catch their fish, and returned before noon
to dispose of them, still fresh, in the
market-place
of the town, and by night
reaching
their island homes again.
Towards the north east shore of
governor's
island Logan pulled his skiff,
which was a rude pirogue, constructed
from a hollow log, and such as was
ordinarily
used by the fishermen of the
islands
.
When he first discovered it and
got into it he saw that it was one of their
boats, and strongly suspected that in
taking
it, he was keeping the owner in town
for the day, or until he could get a
passage
to the island where he dwelt in some
neighbor's canoe.
Leaving him to his fortunes for the
present, we return to Jacob Leisler, who
was not a little amazed and vexed to find
that the young man had taken advantage
of the confusion to make his escape.
At first he thought he must have been
admitted
into the fort; and advanced to the
gate to ascertain. But to his inquiry,
sergeant Graff replied that he knew not
he was from his position, he could not
see to the right and left of the entrance,
and besides, he had been, he said, too
much taken up with looking at the
angry
people coming down upon them, as
if to massacre all in the fortress.
A search was made by looking this
way and that, and peeping into the fosse,
but he had escaped; and as the people
were clamorous for the gates to be
opened
,
Jacob Leisler gave up the attempt to
find him to place him under arrest, which
he wished to do to keep him from doing
his daughter a mischief; for his words
yet rang in his ears.
The gates were now thrown open to
Leisler and his fifty men, who marched
in and took formal possession of the fort
by hoisting the British flag and
proclaiming
William of Orange King of Great
Britain, and the lawful ruler of the
province
of New Amsterdam; for the Dutch
citizens gave this name to the colony,
while the English invariably gave that of
York, which, as well as the English
population
,
at length got the ascendancy
and held it.
Leisler now ranged the garrison, which
consisted of about one hall English
soldiers
and the other half Dutch, around
the interior court-yard of the fort, and
took from them their arms and
accoutrements
,
which they gave up, save five
or six contumacious fellows, who, being
more papal than loyal, resisted the
disarming
process, which at least twenty
more discreet Catholics had wisely and
quietly submitted to. They were,
however
,
not only disarmed, but bound and
thrown into a keeping-room on the left
of the gate, there to remain until they
were converted to Orangeism.
The process of disarming had hardly
got through, before a cry was raised that
the Roman Catholics in the city were
privately arming, with the intention of
retaking the fort. Upon hearing this,
Jacob Leisler, who now saw that he was
actually invested with the chief and only
power of the province, yet almost
insensibly
as it were, forthwith took upon
himself
the authority which every man
looked
to him to assume. He at once, at the
suggestion of his proposed son-in-law,
sent a detachment of twenty-five men
from the fort, and commanded one
hundred
others, who were outside, and who
had arms, to accompany them and
traverse
every street of the town, and report
the state of things. At the head of this
detachment he placed the young
burgomaster
,
who wielded a sword full four
feet long; a weapon of two great
magnitude
and weight for him to use, save to
inspire terror in his enemies, a ruse very
common with cowards, though we do
not wish the reader to infer that
Mynheer
Slems Van Vow was a timid man.
Had he been a coward, he would hardly
have put himself at the head of this war
party. But when the reader is informed
that the young burgomaster was well
aware that there was no danger, the
rumor
having been started by himself, on
his own account, that he might have an
opportunity not only of showing his
patriotism
,
but of exhibiting his military
bravery
to the fair eyes of Bertha Leisler,
whose dwelling he resolved to pass in his
march. Slems well knew that he needed
some deed of valiance and mark to find
favor in her sweet blue eyes; for he was
not so dull that he could not comprehend,
though obscurely, that the maiden
considered
him a very great bore. He had
had, indeed, for some time past, a hazy
notion that she did not think him an
individual
very much entitled to respect,
notwithstanding he had been a
burgomaster
and was worth money.
The detachment marched out of the
fortress with an African drummer at the
head of the column, playing a merry peal
upon the sheep-skin head of his
kettledrum
.
Slems marched up Broadway,
and turned down Wall street and into
Pearl, and down Maiden lane to the
corner of Water street, where he came to
a halt in front of a spacious mansion,
built of Dutch tiles, and bearing all the
the outward marks of an opulent
proprietor
.
This was the abode of Jacob
Leisler
,
the rich merchant, now, as if by
magic
,
elevated to the rule of the province.
Through the streets, thus far, no
person
had been seen, save some women and
children, who fled at the spectacle. Not
a male was visible, save at the windows,
from which scowled many a Papist form
upon the military column. No where
were discoverable any signs of
malcontent
.
Surprise and dismay seemed to
have seized the Roman Catholic
population
and deprived them of their courage
as well as of their political power. What
their Protestant suecessors were to decide
upon, none of them knew, and each
waited in painful suspense the rapid
progress
of events.
What intelligence they got from the
scene of the movements of the party was
gleaned from lads and females who had
ventured as far as the Green, and
returned
with exaggerated accounts of what
was passing. Among these, they were
paralyzed by one which declared that
every soldier in the fort had been
massacred
,
and Robert Logan hanged.
When, at length, the sound of the
drum and fife of the armed party of
observation
,
led by Slems Van Vow, fell
upon their ears, they apprehended the
worst; but when the burgomaster was
seen at their head, with his sleek cheeks
and capon belly, brandishing his
enormous
sword, their fears were dissipated;
for all who knew Mynheer Slems Van
Vow, knew he had the bump of caution
too largely developed to trust himself
within the sphere of personal peril.
When Slems, after patrolling half the
town, reached the dwelling of the fair
Bertha, he halted his men, and forming
them before the house, stood in the front,
and taking his sword in both hands with
a stout grasp, waved it in token of
military homage to her beauty, at least
this was his idea.
The maiden was at the window, for
she had long been watching them with
repeated and anxious questioning of
every
passer-by, touching her father's safety;
for with every rumor his name was
strangely mingled; but, whether for good
or evil to himself she could not
comprehend
.
And although the rattle of the
drum, as the armed men turned from
Nassau Street into Maiden Lane, startled
her, even more than the roar ef the
cannon
a short time before, yet her
apprehensions
were allayed by seeing her
betrothed
burgomaster advancing at the
head of the column. A smile spread
over her face, which was increased to a
merry laugh as she saw with what an air
he marched, while yet it was with
difficulty
he could carry his ponderous sword,
which seemed to gall his shoulder, but
which from its weight and length could
be borne in no other manner.
Several young and beautiful maidens,
but all less fair than she, were assembled
at her house, and were looking forth from
the window. When Slems gave his
salute
Bertha, with a mischeivous laugh,
waved her handkerchief, and called upon
her companions to do the same.
`Welcome, brave burgomaster!' she
cried pleasantly, her eyes sparkling with
mirthfulness; `what is that thou holdest
so firmly in thy two hands?'
`A sword, divine Bertha.'
`It is a dangerous weapon, they say,
in the hands of children. Lest thou
shouldst harm thyself or the drummer
close behind thee, I would advise thee to
wear it in its scabbard.'
`Thou art very loving, sweet Bertha,'
responded Slems in good, simple faith,
`to think so much of my welfare. But
fear thee not, I shall be terrible with it
only to my enemies.'
`What is this great array of men in
arms with thee?' she asked seriously, her
momentary liveliness yielding to the
graver
emotions natural at such an hour.
`I have been placed at their heads by
commands of thy honored father, who is
now chief rulers in the province. Hold
up thy heads, sweet Bertha, for thou art
highers than any maiden in the land!
Verily, Jacobs Leislers is this days even
as a Kings among us, and you are a
princess
.
It is to do thee homages I have
led my mens in arrays before your
dwellings
.
Fare thee wells!'
`Where is my father? Are these
rumors
true, that he has taken upon
himself
the chief rulership of the province?'
`It is, sweet and adorables Berthas,'
responded Slems, waving his sword, or
rather attempting this feat, but with such
awkward success that he well nigh cut
off his own boot, to the great merriment
of the boys of the town, who were gazing
upon him with equal awe and ridicule.
`Then am I sorry, indeed,' said
Bertha
,
not heeding what at another
moment
would have excited her
merriment
.
Her thoughts were upon her
father and his danger. She knew the
fearful responsibility of his position in a
province where the power of the
Catholic
party, though subdued for the moment
was not annihilated. She seemed, with
prophetic eye, to foresee for him, in his
new career, evil and danger she dared
not let her mind rest upon.
`If you are sorrys, divinest and
adorables
,
the province rejoices. Your fathers
is the only mans to save us all.'
`Alas, he is not fitted for this station.
He has not the energy and firmness for
such a crisis. Oh, that I had been near
to have advised him.'
`He did not accept it, celestial eyes,'
answered Slems, bowing with gallantry
at every other word, `but it was thrust
upon him. He could not help it. But
it is a great honors to thee and him and
me! But I cannot delays here, thou
suns of my loves. These are times that
trys mens soul. The peace of the city
is committed to me, and I must see as
nones of the Papists do mischiefs.'
With these words Slems called on his
followers to march foward; and after
parading
through the lower streets, they
once more entered Wall by the dock and
returned to the gate of the fort. Here
all was found comparatively quiet.
Jacob
Leisler had addressed the people and
recommended them to retire peacably to
their several occupations, which many of
the more moderate of the towns-people
did do, but the more zealous and restless
hung about the fort, talking together and
advising many plans for ridding the town
of the Papists. But when the
burgomaster
returned and reported that `not a
Papists
dared shows his heads out of his
windows,' this feeling of vengeance,
which had quickened by fear of the
Catholics
,
subsided.
Jacob Leisler, who now saw himself
so unexpectedly invested with the
supreme
power, began to act with that
firmness
which his situation called for. He
appointed a suitable number of men for
the garrison, and over them placed a
captain
and lieutenants, English born
citizens
,
who had seen service in Europe.
He did this to conciliate the English
protestants
,
who had already began to talk
loudly of Dutch monopoly in the new
administration
of affairs. He also formed
from the people five companies, which
he armed from the arsenal of the citadel,
which were called `train-bands.' These
appointed their own captains and officers,
and were filled principally by volunteers.
The majority composing them were of
Dutch extraction. The duty of these
train-bands was to parade the streets,
guard the town, and overawe the Papists.
CHAPTER III.
THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER.
All
these important measures for the
safety and defence of the town and
Province
were carried into execution during
the day; thus showing that Jacob
Leisler
carried to his responsible position an
energy and ability that could not have
been looked for from a mere merchant.
Still he felt that this ability was not so
much in himself as forced upon him by
the exigencies of the time. He felt that
he was inadequate to the high office
which had been thrust upon him; and
resolved so soon as he placed the affairs
of the Province in a safe position, at once
to surrender the reins of government to
abler and more experienced hands.
There were other men in the Province
who were every way capable, and
perhaps
far better fitted for so high a post,
than Jacob Leisler. His fitness lay in
the fact that he, being a Hollander by
birth, represented the great majority of
the people, who were of Dutch
extraction
;
and also in his influence as a
merchant
,
his wealth, and his being of the
middle class of society, and thus nearer
to the people. He had made himself
what he was by industry and integrity;
and the people felt that he was one of
them. There were other Dutch
gentlemen
of wealth in the Province and in the
town, such as the Stuyvesants, the Liv
ingstones, the Bayards, the Courtlandts;
but they were what were termed `
court-men
,'
that is aristocrats. And besides
Courtlandt, who was the Mayor at the
time of Nicholson's flight, was a Roman
Catholic. The two former, though
protestants
,
were not popular with the
masses
.
Jacob Leisler was therefore the man
of their hearts.
His elevation, therefore, could not fail
to create a third party, headed by these
men. Their envy and jealousy were
aroused
to see a man raised from the
middle
ranks, with the investure of a power
and authority that British noblemen had
hitherto held. Hence while Jacob
Leisler
,
yielding to the wishes of the
majority
,
was fortifying his position, and taking
measures to keep the province in
government
,
until a commissioned Governor
should be sent over by King William,
Bayard, Livingston and others, though
protestants like himself, and adherents to
the King, were secretly assembled in the
elegant mansion of Col. Bayard, which
was situated amid beautiful gardens
facing
the Hudson, half a mile north of
Trinity
Church, and plotting a plan to
prevent
this accession of a mere merchant
to the supreme rule in the province.
Ignorant of this conspiracy, Jacob
Leisler passed the day in establishing
order
and the outline of government; and
so closely had he given himself to these
fatiguing duties that the day had nearly
closed before he felt at liberty to quit the
citadel and seek his own abode.
At length, when he went forth from
the fortress for this purpose, the most
perfect order prevailed. But few persons
were seen on the green, and these
perfectly
peaceable and without arms; and
he even saw several of the Roman
Catholic
citizens walking abroad; for after he
had established order in the town he had
issued a proclamation that every Roman
Catholic, who would wear upon his hat
a yellow ribbon, in token of adherence to
the Prince of Orange, should be
unmolested
,
and retain all the privileges of
citizenship
.
Many of the catholics of the
humbler class had done this, and in every
direction the Orange badge met his eyes,
though not in great numbers, but
sufficient
as he thought to assure him that
he would have no serious difficulty with
this portion of his fellow citizens.
The more influential portion of the
catholics
,
however, appeared not in the
streets, and especially the Mayor
Courtlandt
and his Council, to whom Leisler,
about noon, had sent a formal messenger,
courteously calling upon them to
acknowledge
the authority of William and Mary.
To this message Courtlandt sent back a
reply in these words:
`It is a question whether we should
have felt it our duty to recognise a
Governor
,
commissioned by the usurper
himself
.
You will, therefore, not expect us
to acknowledge the authority of an
usurper
under an usurper. We defy your
power, and shall resist to the best of our
ability.'
To this firm refusal to recognise him,
Leisler made no other reply than
proclaiming
amnesty and friendship to every
Roman
Catholic who would wear the
Orange
ribbon. This proved to be a
sagacious
policy; for among the Romans
were many whose interests were
paramount
to their love for the church, and
who felt no compunctions of conscience
in following the dictates and promptings
of the former.
Jacob Leisler did not leave the fort
to go to his house, where Bertha was
anxiously waiting his return, without a
suitable body-guard. This consisted of
eight men well armed, exclusive of Slems
Van Vow, who walked by his side, a belt
girded about his waist, or rather across
his abdomen, holding a brace of Spanish
pistolets, while in his hand was grasped
the formidable terror-inspiring foe which
had excited the merriment of Bertha
Leisler
.
As the new Captain-General or
Governor
passed along the streets in the
direction
of his habitation, he was cordially
and respectfully greeted by all
passersby
,
also by the citizens, who, with their
families, were gathered at that evening
hour upon their stoops. Every man felt
that the merchant had taken upon
himself
the control of affairs wholly to oblige
them, and not from any personal
ambition
.
They understood the difficulties of
his position, and felt that he should
command
both their reverence and
sympathy
,
as well as he had won their
confidence
.
The Governor acknowledged the kind
respect of his fellow-citizens with a smile,
and occasionally stopped to exchange a
word with some more substantial citizen,
who rose from his stoop to do him honor
as he walked by, with his guard
tramping
behind. As they came near Maiden
lane, where he dwelt, a man passed him,
and as he did so, jostled Slemns, rudely
and rebelliously remarking, that `he
would wear no devil's livery to please any
man; and he who laid hands upon him
would come off the worst.' With these
words he was moving on.
`That fellow is a Catholic; I well
know him,' cried the burgomaster. `Ten
men follow him, and seize him and hold
him fast till I cut him down for daring to
insults the Governor's excellencies, and
rub against me, the Governor's
sons-in-laws
.'
Four of the guard were about to turn
back after the bold Papist, who was well
known to be a fearless, reckless bravo;
but Jacob Leisler said calmly,
Hold, soldiers! Let him pass on his
way. It is better I should receive a few
words, than that the peace of the town
should be broken, as it will be if there is
any collision with the Papists. It
becomes
us to be moderate and forgiving,
if we would sustain our authority.'
`But the fellows have now yellows
ribbon, most excellent Governors!' cried
Slems, looking fiercely after the man,
who had stood still a few yards off, and
looked back, as if waiting them and
defying
them.
`Peace, Mynheer Burgomaster,' said
Jacob Leisler. `That man would not
have done this, if he had not others to
sustain him at hand. Let it pass. This
shows me, however, that we must be on
the watch, for the conduct of this man
proceeds not from himself, but from
instigators
.'
`Do you thinks so, Governors?'
demanded
Slens, with alarm.
`Yes,' answered the Governor, as they
walked forward; `I have no doubt that if
I should give orders to arrest that man,
that a hundred Catholics would, as it
were, rise out of the ground to aid him
with their arms.'
`Let us quicken our march, good
Mynheer Leisler, for it is getting late,
and the fair Bertha will weary waiting
for you.'
With these words the burgomaster
walked rapidly forward, looking
carefully
about him, as if expecting an enemy at
every step. Jacob, however, walked at
the same pace, and at length came to
the door of his mansion. Bertha, who
had been standing upon the stoope,
eagerly
observing him as he approached, and
only prevented by maidenly propriety, in
the presence of so many men about, from
bounding forward to meet him, now
threw her arm about his neck and
welcomed
him with the greatest joy.
`Thanks to God, dear father, that I
see you home in safety after this day's
dangers!'
`Heaven bless you, little one!' he
said with parental affection, as he return
ed her kisses with one upon her bright
brow.
`And now, Berthas, have you no
welcomes
for me?' said the burgomaster,
smiling with that imperturable
self-satisfaction
that never deserted him.
`Put away that dreadful sword,' she
said, with a mischievous light in her
mirthful eye. `How can you alarm a
maiden with coming near her in such
a warlike guise?'
`Bless me! I forgots, lovey; for
being
so used to wars, I knew not that I
had it in my hand! I know womens are
timid; they have nerves. I have nones.
Take this swords, two of you, and keeps
it so that none of the boys shall finger it.
Stand back, youngsters, and come not
so near the excellent Governor's
presence
.
`Now, light of my eyes,' he cried,
turning round with his arms extended, as
if he would fold his bride elect to his
heart; but to his surprise she had
vanished
into the house, taking her father
with her.
`Soldiers!' said Slems, in no wise
discomfited
,
and addressing the body-guard,
who were a fine-looking set of soldiers,
commanded by Sergeant Graff, `you will
remains without here untils orders from
his excellencys. You will see that no
Papist goes past without the Orange
ribbons
.
You will disperse these boys, who
seem to have no fear of the great warlike
doings that has been done this days, but
laughs in the faces of warlikes captains.'
With these words the burgomaster
entered
the house, passing through a file of
young girls, the daughters of the
principal
Dutch citizens in the neighborhood,
who, with an indefinable sort of
sympathy
,
had gathered at her house, as if she
could extend to them that protection and
countenance which her influential father
was conferring upon the town and
province
.
Their manner had very much
changed towards Bertha since the
accession
of her father to the supreme rule in
the colony had become known. They
restrained
their former frank familiarity,
and kept it under by an air of respect
that had no other effect upen her than to
make her experience a painful feeling of
restraint. The burgomaster also
experienced
the same sensations of awe when
he entered the parlor and beheld Bertha
seated by her father's side. He seemed
to realise all at once that there sat the
Governor of the province and the
daughter
of the Governor of the province.
Then came the idea that to this
daughter
of the Governor he, Slems Van Vow,
burgomaster, was betrothed in marriage
prospective. Hereupon he began to
realise
fully the dignity of his own elevation
as prospective son-in-law to the Governor
of the province.
With these feelings swelling in his
bosom, he entered the room where sat
Jacob Leisler and Bertha interchanging
alone their grateful congratulations; not
upon his elevation, for he coveted it not,
and she thought not of it as elevating her
above the maidens of the land; for
Bertha
had no pride nor selfishness. She
loved her father with alll her heart, and
as cordially despised, if she could despise
what she could laugh at, the self-satisfied,
vain, and ridiculous fat little
burgomaster
,
to whom her father, with singular
and unaccountable weakness was
strongly
attached and coveted for his son-in-law.
To prevent offending, or rather grieving
her father, the light hearted maiden
received
the attentions of the young citizen,
making up her mind that she would so
demean herself in his presence that he
would be happy to cry a-mercy and beg
Jacob Leisler to absolve him `from all
ambitions towards his daughter.'
But Slems was of a composition not
easily affected by wit raillery, laughter
or ridicule. He had not delicacy of
perception
sufficient to take or comprehend
an inuendo. He never saw a double
meaning
in words. He was unable to draw
an inference the most palpable He stood
upon the broad basis of his own low
Dutch platform, and saw every thing
upon
the same level. Every thing was to
him as it seemed. Bertha appeared to him
to be very much pleased with him, for
she laughed at every thing he said, and
was always merry in his company. But
he was too matter-of-fact to see that he
was the cause and object of her
mirthfulness
;
that she looked upon him, not as a
dignified lover, as he conceived himself
to be, but in the light of an over grown,
good-natured poodle, too large to pet yet
not too ludicrous in its attempts at puppy
antics, to afford amusement.
More than a year had the burgomaster
been a diligent and devoted suitor of the
beautiful maiden, spending every
Sunday
evening regularly at her house; but
always she was sure to be provided with
a fun-loving lass from her acquaintance,
so that, if we may credit Slems' account,
the evenings went off merrilys and wit
great pleasurables. Never had she met
him alone; and as he was by no means
an individual of great courage either in
love or war, he doubtless felt it a great
relief to have a third person present, to
keep him in countenance; for in the end
he knew she was to be his vrow, this
being
a settled matter, and so courting
alone was quite a superfluous agitation
of his nervous system Every Sunday,
therefore, Slems would go to the
merchant's
,
sit the evening and looking at
Bertha in that sort of pleased selfish way
which a purchaser of a very fine animal
who was not to be delivered to him till a
certain day, would walk over to gaze by
the hour upon it and congratulate
himself
in his bargain. There is no question
but that Slems loved the maiden, so far
as he was capable of loving, and that any
thing which should prevent the marriage,
which was to take place the nineteenth
of June, would touch his heart
grievously
.
Jacob Leisler would also take such
an event severely, as he felt that
Mynheer
Van Vrow, though not gifted by
nature
with extraordinary talents, was a
young gentleman of good character, fair
temper, and of handsome substance, and
better calculated, in his belief, to render
his daughter happy through life, than any
of the gay gallants of the former royal
governor's suit who used to hang around
her steps and boldly compliment her
upon
her beauty.
`I congratulates you, fair daughters of
the governor,' said Slems as he entered
the parlor; and bowing with respect to
both. `I feel honored by my intimacys
with the familys of such distinguished
peoples; I never expected, Mynheer
Leisler
to be the son-in-law of the ruler of
the Province.'
`You need not congratulate me, my
good burgomaster,' answered Jacob
Leisler
,
`I am, it is true, invested with the
power in the land, but until it is
confirmed
by the new King, I am little better
than an usurper. Still the reins must be
in some one's hands, and as the citizens
have placed them in mine, I do not feel
at liberty to lay them down. I shall act
for the King to the best of my ability.'
`I feel, dear father,' said Bertha, `that
this is an unfortunate day for you. I
would rather the people had placed the
authority in some other hand. You have
fierce spirits and bold to contend with
already. If rumor speaks the truth, there
is, besides the catholics, a strong
Protestant
party forming against you, headed
by the Mayor Courtlandt and colonel
Bayard.'
`Most brave Governors, give me the
authoritys, and I will at once and
commands
Sergeant Graffs to go and arrests
these traitors, and put them into
confinements
in the citadels. Fear not, lovely
Bertha. I will stand between thy father
and danger.'
`If you stood near him with your sword
in your hand, I fear you would do him
more harm than his foes,' answered
Bertha
,
with a smile.
`We can't take any steps against our
own religious friends, though they
politically
oppose us,' answered the Governor.
`We must conciliate. With my consent
there shall be no civil broil. Now, good
burgomaster, if you will remain without
with the guard until I come, you will
oblige
me, as I desire some private
conference
with my daughter.'
`Allow me to salutes thee, fair
Berthas
!'
said the young burgomaster
approaching
;
`it will inspires me with
valors
!'
`You need no inspiration, Mynheer;
you would be dangerous with more
courage
than you have.'
`That is a rare compliments to me. I
know I am a brave mans, and all I
desires
is that I may have some occasions
in these bloody times to show you that I
can protects beauty.'
The burgomaster then bowed as low
as his little round paunch would permit,
and making a military salute with his
hand to the Governor left the room, and
walked to the street door. Around it
were assembled men and boys in great
numbers, some armed, a few having the
yellow ribbon in their hats. All were
gazing at the house, or at the small guard
of soldiers which were drawn up before
the door. They were quiet, and only
seemed waiting to see their Governor
again. A few of the men had swords
buckled to their sides, and one or two on
the skirts of the crowd leaned upon
muskets
;
for all had not yet returned their
arms to the beckets above their
mantelpieces
,
from which they had taken them
down in the morning.
`Dear father,' said Bertha, as soon as
the burgomaster left her alone with him,
now that you have restored peace to the
town, and established an outline of
government
do, I implore you, send in at
once your resignation.'
`To whom shall I send it. There is
none in power to receive it.'
`To any one. To Col. Bayard; he
is a protestant and friend of the new
reign.'
`True; but he is an English partisan.
He and his friends are opposed to the
Dutch population. They are, too, in the
minority. If I should surrender the
authority
to him, the people who invested
me with it, would wrest it from him by a
revolution, and I should be the first
victim
!
No; I can only surrender it to the
masses from whom I received it.
`Do it at once!' she cried earnestly.
`At the risk of anarchy and confusion
without parallel. They would perhaps
refuse to accept it, for they fairly forced
me to assume the power; or if they
accepted
it it would be to quarrel for the
precedency among themselves till riot
and misrule would reign. There are,
perhaps, certain circumstances, which
combined, render me the most suitable
person just at this crisis to take this
heavy
responsibility. I have assumed it, and
therefore, I must maintain it, let what be
the issue. For wisdom to rule I look to
the Ruler over all.'
`This is painful.' You will be exposed
to the malice of your enemies, both
Papal
and protestant. But if you feel that
it is your duty, and that you can serve
your country by continuing in power
until
a Governor arrives, I will no longer
object.'
`Thanks, sweet daughter. I feel that
to resign now, when all men seem to look
to me, would be treacherous.'
`Then, sir,' she said, after a moment
of reflection, `if such is your decision, I
beg you will, without delay, send an ad
dress to the throne of William and Mary,
acknowleding their power, and
submitting
yourself to their authority and
pleasure
.
State the circumstances of the
revolution
of this day, which has thrust the
government upon you, and assure their
majesties of your loyalty and humble
devotion
.
This step, taken at once will,
may be, get you the royal ear and favor
in advance of the protestant party headed
by Colonel Bayard and Mr. Livingston,
who will no doubt send news at once to
England, and so represent and color the
doings of to-day, that you will be looked
upon by the King as a rebel instead of a
useful and faithful servant of the crown.'
`My daughter, your words are full of
wisdom and experience. With such a
councillor I shall govern safely. What
you say is likely to prove true. My
enemies
will not let slip the earliest occasion
to do me an injury, as you have said. I
will prepare it this night and despatch it
by the first ship.'
`Nay, sir! wait not for a ship to sail
from this port. Once a month a ship
goes to London from the town of Boston.
It lacks but five days to the day of her
departure. Bayard will have letters, if
not a messenger, in that ship to inform
against you. You must have an address
on board also.'
`It shall be done. I will despatch a
private postman on horseback by dawn
with my pacquet to the King.'
`Oh, that I were a youth, sir; I would
not only be its post-bearer but sail with
it in the ship, and in person reach the
King before all others, and lay it at his
feet!'
`You are a noble girl, Bertha. The
address shall be sent, and by a trusty
messenger,' answered her father, with
decision.
CHAPTER IV.
THE MESSENGER.
`Now, my dear child,' said the
merchant-governor
,
taking by the hand the
beautiful girl who had manifested so much
forethought and wisdom, `now before
going
away for the purpose of writing to
the King, I wish to say a few words to
you in a confidential manner.'
`Certainly, dear father,' she answered,
looking into his face with surprise at his
grave manner; and beginning directly
to think that it was some matter
touching
hastening her union with the
burgomaster
on account of the troubled state
of the times.
`Have you ever met with the young
secretary, Robert Logan?' He fixed his
eyes keenly upon her face as he put the
inquiry.
She colored and started a little with
evident emotion, and then dropping her
eyes to the floor upon which her little
foot, shod with a velvet slipper was
drumming
as if it was in quite as much
perplexity
as its fair mistress:
`Yes, sir!'
`Where was it?' he continued, not
unobservant
of her embarrassment.
`At the door of the Conventicle in the
fort the first time, sir.'
`The
first
time! Have you met him
more than once?
`I have seen him on my way to
conventicle
,
sir, and he has caught my eye
during the prayer, I believe, sir; and he
has passed the house when I have been
at the window.'
`This shows more communion between
this young gentleman and you than I
believed
.
Has he had speech of thee
ever?'
`But once, sir,' was the still downcast
answer.
`Then he
has
spoken to you?'
`Yes sir,
once
!' she exclaimed, with
very marked emphasis upon the last word.
`Where and when?'
`It was in the conventicle, sir. He was
in the pew behind ours, and my kneeling
cushion was gone, which he seeing, bent
over and said most civilly and
courteously
.
`Fair maiden kneel upon this,' and
therewith, sir, cast his velvet short-cloak
down upon the floor before me.'
`And did you kneel upon it?'
`I was in the act of kneeling upon the
hard bricks of the church floor when he
did this, and I found myself pressing the
cloak before I could recover myself; and
besides, sir, it would have been quite a
discourtesy to have rejected it, so I
kneeled
upon it till the prayers were over and,
then gave it to him again.'
`Did you say anything?
`I thanked him, sir.'
`And he?'
`He said that henceforth it should be
sacred to him, and though he was
somewhat
worse as to his prayers he would not
fail three times a day to kneel upon the
same cloak and say them! So, sir; if I
had refused him,' she added with the least
perceptible archness sparkling beneath
the soft shadow of her down-falling lids,
`I should have missed this occasion of
doing his soul a great good.'
`Beshrew me, you are very simple or
very artful, Bertha,' said her father
observing
her sternly. But he could
discover
nothing in her demure sweet looks
to confirm any suspicion that had started
in his mind that she cared for the young
man a groat, or under an air of
simplicity
,
sought to disguise her feelings from
him; for Jacob Leisler had good reason
from the proposition made to him by
Logan
,
to believe that he knew more of his
daughter than he himself had ever
dreamed
of. There were a few moments of
mutual silence, during which Bertha
raised her clear full blue eyes, and fixed
them calmly and openly upon his face;
yet with an air of wonder in them at this
catechising. Yet she asked no question,
knowing that her father would, if left to
himself, unfold all; while a direct
inquiry
would be sure to place a seal upon his
communicativeness. At length the
Governor
spoke:
`And these are all the occasions on
which this young gentleman has had
speech of you, daughter?'
`Yes, sir, I remember none other.'
`What think you of him?'
`A fair looking gentleman, sir, with a
pleasant voice and expressive eyes; and
a carriage somewhat noble and free.'
`A character more free than noble you
might also have said; for he is as gay as
a French courtier, and as fanciful in his
costume. I am sorry he has ever seen
you! You are beneath his degree, for he
is a scion of one of England's noblest
trees, and will one day become a peer of
the realm, if rumor gives it true of him
Such a man hath no business casting his
velvet cloaks before a burgher's
daughter
.'
`It was done with kindness, sir!'
`I dare say. If he had kissed thy cheek
it had been done with kindness.'
`Nay, sir, that is too free, even from
thee father,' she said with wounded pride,
her eye bright with feeling and proper
resentment.
`I meant not to offend thee; I meant to
show that young maids, in their
unsuspecting
innocence of wrong, look not as
they onght upon advances of young men.
There was no great harm in this matter
of the cloak, so it went no further. But
I had rather it had not happened; for he
hath presumed upon it.'
`In what way, sir? He is too noble
to think me an injury, much more do me
one.'
`There it is! You betray your
pleasure
at the thoughts of him in every word
you utter. Is this beseeming in a maiden
betrothed, and whose day is but three
weeks off?'
`I am sorry, sir, if I have offended.
I meant no harm.'
`No, but he has presumed on your
kind word, and perhaps the smile with
which you acknowledged your obligation
to him, to suppose that he can claim an
interest in your affections.'
`Indeed, sir!' exclaimed the maiden,
with a deep blush of pleasurable
surprise
.
`It may well amaze you, for I
perceive
that he has had no color of ground
for his hopes. To-day he sent for me to
say, in private, that he was deeply
enamoured
of my daughter'
`Of me, sir?'
`Yes. You may well exclaim, child;
and your brow glow with indignation.'
But it was not the flush of anger, but of
pleased surprise that mantled her face, as
if her cheeks had suddenly become
transmuted
into roses.
`He said that he had often seen you,
and that he felt that he could not be
happy
unless you became his wife; and he
furthermore said that he would surrender
the fort, if I would surrender you.'
`This was bold, sir,' she said, seeing
that she must say something, though she
would rather not have trusted her voice,
lest she should betray how happy she was
to hear what he revealed to her,
unconscious
of the part he was acting in
producing
in her bosom a reciprocity of
sentiment
with that of the young secretary,
who, truth to tell, had long had a very
precious little corner in her heart all to
himself, a felicity of which he was
altogether
ignorant, save so far as her
emotion
,
whenever she met him, betrayed to
him her gentle pleasure. From the first
six months before, she had caught the
fine eyes of the handsome secretary
fastened
upon her in the conventicle, she
had felt both her curiosity and interest
awakened in him. Curiosity in a young
maiden to know who is the handsome
stranger who has been detected fixedly
and warmly regarding her, is sure to
beget
an interest in him when this is
satisfied
;
and interest leads to liking, and
liking, if all circumstances move
harmoniously
together, to love.
In this way had interest and kindly
feeling towards Robert Logan grown in
the young bosom of Bertha Leisler. If,
by chance, she did not see him standing
in the porch of the conventicle, to gaze
upon her as she passed in, she was
disappointed
;
and if he were not at service
at all, they passed heavily and unheeded.
The little act of gallantry touching the
cloak, had deepened emotions that
glances hitherto had only created and
kept alive. The sound of his low voice,
as he uttered the few words across the
railing of the pew, thrilled to her heart,
and as she moved homeward, her bosom
was filled with delight, she hardly knew
whence, save only that with it the
handsome
secretary's form was blended.
But still she loved not. A maiden may
feel gratitude, interest, and deep regard
for a youth, and yet nothing beyond, save
he advances. Her heart is only prepared
to love; she does not yet love. So it was
with Bertha; circumstances only were
wanting to make that love which yet had
no name, and scarcely a being.
`What reply did you make to Mr.
?' she asked, seeing her father some
time silent.
`That I would not accept the fort at
his hands on such conditions. That you
were already betrothed to the young
burgomaster
,
and were only waiting for your
birth-day to be united. He said that
Mynheer could neither love nor
understand
you; and said, very insolently, that
in giving you to the burgomaster, I was
throwing a pearl before a hog. This
angered
me.'
`Nay, sir, you should have let the
compliment paid to me have caused you
to overlook that to Mynheer Van Vow,'
she said, laughing.
`Methinks, daughter, you of late show
a disposition to ridicule the worthy and
virtuous young burgomaster.'
`No, sir, the ridicule is in himself.
I do but speak as his appearance
irresistibly
suggests.'
`It would please me that you shoul
comport yourself before him and to hi
with more affection'
`Does Mynheer Slems make complaint
of me to you?'
`Not in the least. He invariably
speaks of you in the most satisfactory
manner. He has said nothing.'
`Then, sir, permit him to be the
judge.'
`But I wish you to appear more in
public with him, especially at
conventicle
.
Is it not becoming to treat your
future
husband with public respect?'
`When he is my husband, sir, I will
so treat him,' she answered something
firmly. `What more said this secretary?'
`The secretary, methinks, is more
agreeable to thy thoughts than the worthy
burgomaster. I will answer thee, as I
would put thee on thy guard. When he
found that I would not consent to give
you to him, he showed much fire of
resentment
,
and holdly bade me look
sharply after thee, for you should be his
bride ere you should be the burgomaster's
wife.'
`Said he so much, sir!' she exclaimed
with animation and with pleasurable
surprise
;
and it would have been singular if
a young girl did not manifest some
emotion
at such a flattering compliment to
the power of her charms over a stranger,
and he handsome, high-born und
confessedly
in love with her; and from whom
when she had met with him she had been
eye-worshipped as if she had been his
divinity.
Jacob Leisler looked to see her
countenance
change with alarm, but it
betrayed
no fear, greatly to his amazement.
`You do not seem to apprehend that
he will carry his threat into execution.'
`Yes sir, I fear he will not.'
`You fear he will, you mean.'
`Yes, sir, I fear he will(not.') This
last tone was uttered
sotto voce
.
`It becomes you to be on your guard,
and not to venture out even upon the
stoope after dark. I know not where this
young man now is! He has made his
escape
.
A rumor reached me that he had
been seen putting off in a boat, and a
fisherman even came to me demanding
justice, grievously complaining that his
skiff had been stolen from the shore,
where he left it. It is, therefore, likely
he has made his escape to the islands.
He is a bold, fearless man as we have all
had evidence, since his sojourn in the
Province, and in his audacious attempt to
hold the fort. There is no question but
that he will be sufficiently enticed by your
beauty, Bertha, to attempt to do you
mischief
.
Therefore keep close, and by day
go not out unless the burgomaster attend
you.'
`I hear you, sir, but I pray you, if he
is to attend me, choose two good steady
men to carry his sword for him; for he
will be sure to cut off my head with it in
some of his fearful movements with it as
he goes along the streets.'
`You laugh at the young man, but he
will make you a good husband. He will
grow wiser as he grows in years, and will
be an honor to you if you honor him by
duty and obedience.'
`But sir, are you not going to dwell in
the Governor's house in the fort?' asked
Bertha, who wished, by suggesting this
to him, to be freer in her own movements
and less annoyed by the continual
presence
of the burgomaster, who, if her
residence
was to be made the head quarters,
would be constantly present as an
attendant
upon her father.
`True; that will be necessary, as all
the public papers and officers are there;
and as I shall have much company at all
hours I will do so. Besides, it is
needful
I remain in the fort for the better
security
thereof and firmer clenching my
power.'
`So I should suppose, sir.'
`And with you there I need not fear
anything from this young Logan,
whatever
be the character of his intrusions.'
`Indeed sir, you need not fear him, I
do not,' she answered, both archly and
seriously seeing that her plan was likely
to involve her own liberty of action.
`I shall not leave you in the town and
alone in the house, Bertha. I shall need
a house-keeper in the fort and to eat and
drink. I shall to-morrow move you and
the two servants with such things as are
needful.'
Bertha saw that she could not say any
thing to this decision, and she quietly
acquiessed
.
She had no definite motive
in wishing to remain in the town, other
than an undefinable idea that she might,
thereby possibly see the young secretary,
whom she felt sure of not seeing if she
was shut up in the Governor's house
within
the fort; for within this defence was
located both the government mansion and
the principle protestant church in town,
which, in the various changes of
dynasty
had successively been a Dutch
reformed
,
an English Episcopalean, and Roman
Catholic chapel, and now about to be
fully restored to its puritan worship again.
Even when a Roman chapel it was on
alternate Sabbaths used for the
accommodation
of the protestants, as a `
conventicle
;'
which will account for Bertha's
having been there and seen the young
secretary, who, though a papist, was
drawn thither on conventicle Sundays
by the beauty of the burgher's daughter.
This mutual occupation of the same
edifice
by catholics and protestants was not
unusual in the early days of the colonies
during the reign of James; though in all
other respects, singularly enough, there
was little love or courtesy.
Bertha, also, by being in the town
hoped to be out of the way of the young
burgomaster, who, ever since she had
began
to think of the handsome secretary,
had become particularly distasteful to her.
She had let things flow smoothly on
between
herself and him and her father
without
objection; but as the time drew nigh
fixed for the marriage to take place, she
began to have certain misgivings that her
fate was sealed, and that she would have
to submit to her father's will.
Nevertheless
she resolved to do her best in the
interim to make the burgomaster utterly
repent of his bargain. She had for this
purpose planned with two young friends
an ingenious and most mischevous
system
of tactics expressly bearing upon the
unfortunate young wooer. This she had
intended to put into operation upon her
victim the very day the revolution broke
out.
But this attempt did not alter her
determination
,
which was rather confirmed
by the pleasing revelation made to her
by her father, that the gallant young
secretary
was passionately enamoured with
her. This intelligence which found an
echo of joy in her heart, served to give
point and direction to her purposes
touching
Slems Van Vrow. She now felt that
if she could defeat him she might yet find
a more congenial wooer in the youthful
nephew of the Governor, who had
already
half her heart.
But all these thoughts were vague and
unformed in the brain of the pretty
Bertha
.
One thing only was formed and
settled in her mind, and this was, that
she would never marry the fat little
burgomaster
,
even to please her dear-loved
father. Whether she should ever marry
any body else was altogether quite an
indistinct
,
dreamy notion that she had
hardly
dared to dwell upon, delightful as it
was.
The removal to the castle, or rather
fort, was to take place early the ensuing
morning; and her father, after taking
tea with his daughter and leaving her to
put up and send such things as would be
needful for them during their sojourn
there, took his departure to return to the
citadel and place it and the town in a
state of defence against any combination
of the Papists. Guards were posted at
different points in the town, and sentries
paced the streets with wary vigilance. A
countersign was established, and a
proclamation
sent forth and published by the
tongue and bell of the town-crier, that
all citizens found out of their houses after
the bell rang nine o'clock, should be
placed under arrest.
It was full half-past nine o'clock
before
Jacob Leisler got through with the
important business before him. Among
the affairs transacted was not only
placing
the city under military law, but the
appointment of a committee of safety to
act with him as a council of advisement
for the immediate government of the
province; the committee being chosen
from the most influential burgesses of the
town of his party. This committee also
signed an agreement, drawn up by Jacob
Leisler, to adhere to the Prince of
Orange, and, with their
lives
, to support
the Protestant religion. The five
captains
of the trainbands, each of them
substantial and tried citizens, formed a
part of this committee and affixed their
names to the instrument.
Jacob Leisler having settled thus
happily
all these weighty matters, and
thereby
shifted much of the responsibility of
the government upon the shoulders of
the council he had appointed, began
to-feel
more confidence in himself and his
position. He now made known to the
committee his purpose to despatch,
without
delay, an address to the King, with a
copy of the agreement they had signed,
so that any malicious communications
from their enemies, Bayard and
Livingstone
,
might be forestalled.
The time necessary to draw up the
address
and get the co-operation of his
council, made it so late, that at ten
o'clock he despatched the burgomaster
with a message to his daughter that he
should not be able to return that night,
but that Mynheer Van Vow would act
as her protector. This message being
despatched by the little round
burgomaster
,
the new Governor gave himself up
to preparing his address to the King.
It was a novel position for a quiet
merchant
to be all at once drawn from the
sphere of middle life and the privacy of
a simple citizen, to controul the affairs
of a province, establish a government,
provide for the preservation of the peace
and the security of his authority, forming
a council, proclaiming martial law, and
holding supreme power at his own will,
all in the same day, and then to sit down
at night to address a powerful monarch
to acknowledge his power and rule.
But Jacob Leisler, with the emergency,
found himself equal to all that was
demanded
of him. His talents, though not
of a high order, were respectable, and he
possessed a certain dignity of character
and air which commanded the respect of
men who felt that they were his equals,
if not superior to him. The address
which he drew up bore evidences of
experience
,
wisdom, and diplomatic skill,
that was not looked for from a merchant;
and being read to his council, received
their unanimous approbation. It was
past midnight before the address and
other documents, to be forwarded to the
crown by the Boston ship, were sealed and
ready for the messenger, who, when he
made his appearance booted and spurred,
and armed to the teeth, proved to be the
brave Sergeant Graff.
As he stood before the council, the
Governor delivered to him the package,
which he placed in a pouch of deer-skin,
slung beneath his arm, and firmly
secured
it.
`You will ride night and day,
sergeant
,
until you reach Boston, sparing
neither
your horse nor yourself. Should you
find that there is a messenger from
Bayard
on board, which be diligent to
ascertain
,
you will embark also; for you have
in this pocket-book funds sufficient to
take you to England, maintain you there
two months, if need be, and bring you
back. Your business is to get the ear of
the King, and deliver this package into
his hands before any other can approach
him from the province. Now seek your
horse and ride, and God speed you on
your way.'
The sergeant gave a brief, military
salute to the Governor and his council
and left the apartment. He passed out
of the fort and walked on across the
Green, answering challenges every few
rods. He traversed the whole length of
the town until he reached a grove full
half a mile above the Green, where he
found a horse tied a little off from the
road, and thus far out that the sound of
his hoofs might not excite suspicions in
Bayard's party. He loosed him,
mounted
him, and galloped rapidly away on the
road to New England.
CHAPTER V.
THE FISHING HUT.
We now return to the adventures of
Robert Logan, whom we left escaping
from the fortress down the harbour in a
small fisherman's pirogue, which he had
taken from the mouth of the fosse.
He pulled steadily on until he came
within about one hundred rods of
Governor's
Island, and directly in front of a
rude fishing cabin, overshadowed by
forrest
trees, opposite which, anchored in a
small boat, sat a youth about sixteen
years of age, engaged in fishing. As
Logan
rowed forwards the youth raised his
head and gazed at him with very
manifest
surprise. He was a short,
freckled-faced
,
sunburned urchin, with burnt
whity
hair, which had probably never had a
comb passed through it, a pug nose, and
small, twinkling light blueish eyes. He
had on a pair of patched canvas breeches
that came to his bare knees, and a
patched
shirt that he had probably worn as he
did his trowsers, without washing for a
year or two. He was bare headed and
bare legged.
From a close, squinting scrutiny of
Logan's appearance, he began to inspect
the pirogue which he was in; when as if
satisfied, he all at once broke out with
`Dod and lobsters, you stranger chap,
but that's feyther's scow any how. What
be ye doin with it, and whar's feyther?'
Logan stopped rowing and looked at
the speaker with a smile of curiosity.
`So this is your father's boat?'
`Yah; and what the devil have you
done with feyther?' he demanded, very
resolutely.
`Your father's over in the city. Do
you live in that cabin?'
`Yah; but how come you, chappy,
with the old sucker's boat?' he repeated,
not seeming to care for the apparent
distinction
of the stranger; for Logan wore
an undress uniform surtout, with a sword
and belt, in which was stuck a brace of
elegant pistols. Besides, his chapeau,
which lay upon the seat by him, was
laced
and adorned with a cockade.
`Who do you call the old sucker?'
asked
Logan, laughing at the fearless
impudence
of the ragged varlet.
`It's dad. But that aint tellin what I
want to know. If you've stole that are
scow you'd better never see'd daylight.'
`How much would your father sell the
scow for?' asked Logan, wishing to
conciliate
him, for he had made up his mind
to seek, for the present, an asylum in the
fishing hut.
`How much? Did you buy it of the
old devil then? If you have he's
drinked
it all up by himself, and'll come home
drunk as a crab'
`No, I hav'nt bought it, but I will.
What shall I pay?'
`Three silver dollars; not a steeny
less,' answered the boy.
`There is a gold guinea,' answered
Logan, rowing along side and placing it
in his hand.
`No cheatin, chappy,' said the lad,
cautiously eyeing him and then biting the
money between his teeth, to ascertain if
it would bend or no. `I'm not sure but
this is a flum. Hant you no silver? You
cant fix me on silver, no how, chappy.'
Logan tortunately had four dollars in
silver in his purse, for which the boy
gladly gave back the guinea; but each
of the pieces he deliberately dug into
with the point of his fish knife before
transferring it with confidence to a black
looking seal skin pocket or pouch in his
waist band.
`The boat is mine now,' said Logan,
not a little amused at his precautions,
also at his bold, saucy, brusque manner.
`Yah, yours to burst to blazes with if
you want it. But where's dad?'
`Over in town, I suppose.'
`What flummucks be they kickin up
thar? I heard firin and a muss.'
`Why, you see, the good old King
James is turned out of his throne by
another
,
and so over to the town the friends
of the old King have had to give up the
fort to the new King.'
`That's the muss is it,' he said,
carelessly
,
and with the most perfect
indifference
,
as he baited his hook and cast his
line over the gunwale of his boat into the
water: `I wonder if the new King's folks
'll give more for fish than the old uns?'
`Be sure they wont, for there'll be a
falling off. The new King's friends dont
keep lent and fast days, and so they wont
buy fish.'
`Dont 'ey keep lent, tho'?' exclaimed
the youngster, with surprise.
`No, they wont keep lent or fast
Fridays
,'
answered Logan, who saw that he
had the boy on the right side of politics
for himself.
`Then I'll none o' the new King!' he
cried, very positively. `What is this
new King's name, chappy?'
`Orange.'
`Orange! That's queer.'
`It is because he eats oranges instead
of fish.'
`Then let him and his orange go to the
devil,' responded the boy heartily. `What
kind of a king's man are you?' he asked,
eyeing him closely.
`The old king.'
`Then you and I are friends.'
`I am happy to be your friend,'
answered
Logan. `Now as we understand
each other, I will tell you how I came to
be here and in your father's boat. I was
Secretary of the former Governor who
has fled from the Orange people and is
now on board yonder ship that is just
visible standing seaward. I held on to
the fort as long as I could, but found the
Oranges too strong for me, and so I made
my escape from them. I was so fortunate
as to find this boat on the shore behind
the fort, when, without asking by your
leave. I sprang into it and paddled out of
the way; and here I am as you see; and
happy am I to fall in the way of a friend
to King James.'
`Which is King James the fish or
orange
king?'
`Fish.'
`Hurrah for King James!'
`The friend of the fishermen!' loudly
repeated Logan, who now saw that he
had won his acquaintance.
`You say you took dad's boat to get
away, hey?' said the lad, fumbling very
seriously at his money pouch and
pouring
the silver out into his palm.
`Yes. It would not have been safe for
me to have been taken by them.'
`Then, I'm blessed if I'll take money
for the boat;' and he extended it towards
him with a sort of noble air.
`You do not repulse it,' exclaimed
Logan
,
gazing on him with sarprise at
conduct
so unlooked for from such a
dare-devil
looking, freckled-faced urchin.
`Yes I do! you shant pay no how;
you are welcome to the use o' the boat;
and if you'll row ashore and come to the
cabin, you shall have something to eat.'
`You are very hospitable, but you
forget
that I am escaping from my enemies
and that if they should be told where I
am, they would come after me.'
`How'll they know it? None on 'em
come here.'
`But your father!'
`He's dead fish agin orange, and 'll be
glad to keep you; so, chappy come ashore
and stay as long as you will.'
This invitation was given by the lad
with rough but hearty hospitality. It
suited Logan's purposes to avail himself
of the offer, and, thanking him he pulled
in shore, side by side with his boat; for
he had drawn in his lines and taken to
his oars also. As they rowed along
Logan
made up his mind to make that place
his asylum for the present, as none could
be more advantageous from its
contiguity
to the town; and as the fishermen
would prove his friends, it would be as
safe as some place farther removed where
he could not place such confidence in the
people. But he felt that in the boy he
could place the utmost faith; he saw that
though ignorant, he was naturally shrewd,
fearless and independant, and had
something
noble in his character, as was
evinced
by his refusal to take money for the
boat, which, however, Logan insisted he
should retain.
`From this retreat,' reflected Logan,
`I can at any time visit the town in
disguise
and through the fishermen daily
hear from it. I have not yet given up
all hopes of doing something for my
party
yet. Ere twenty years pass I will be
there among them.'
They now reached the shore, and
leaving
the two skiffs in a small cove between
two rocks, advanced towards the hut,
which was situated about fifty steps from
the water, and facing the town which lay
about two miles or little less to the
northward
.
`Who have you in the hut? Who lives
with you?, asked the young secretary.
`No body but feyther and I. Meyther
has been dead deal a time ago.'
`Glad my Meyther is dead! Then
ye're like the old man, for he is pesky
glad; for he says she was a hard 'un.'
`No, I did not mean I was glad she
was dead, but glad there was no more in
your family than yourself and father; for
I shall be less likely to be betrayed. Are
you sure your father 'll like to find me
here?'
`He'd like to find himself here first,
I'm thinkin',' said the boy dryly, as he
kicked open the door of the hut. `He'll
swear
some
when he finds the boat gone:
I shore I'll have to pull up to town after
him and bring him home.'
`I hope he will not be so vexed as to
inform on me when he finds I am here.'
`Not a bit! I'll give him the silver, and
talk to him about Fish and Orange, and
he'll be ready to fight for the old King
and you to, give him blue gin enough.'
The hut was a rude cabin, containing
but a single apartment, hung about with
fishing apparatus, and holding in one
corner
,
a bed. A table, and three or four
chairs; a chest, and two barrels half
filled
with dried fish, were all the furnishing,
save a couple of patched and coarse
fishermen's
suits, that hung about the bed.
As soon as Logan's eye fell on these,
he made up his mind what he would do,
`Are those fisherman's clothes your
father's?' he asked.
`Yes,' answered the boy, pouring out
a dram of gin from a stone bottle into
an earthen cup, and drinking it off. He
then deliberately refilled it and handed it
to Logan, who declined it, very much to
the surprise of his young host.
`I have a plan in my head, my friend.
What is your name?'
`Steiny Sneck; what is yourn?'
`Robert Logan.'
`Now let's hear your plan,' he said,
throwing himself back into a chair.
`You must know, I left the town so
suddenly, that I had no time to look
after
my affairs. Now, I wish to go back
again to-night; but as I should doubtless
be hanged, if taken, I wish to disguise
myself.'
`What is disguise?'
`I wish to put on your father's fishing
clothes, so that they'll take me for a
fisherman. In this way I can deceive the
Oranges.'
`It's capital; you shall have 'em; but
on one condition.'
`What is it?'
`That I go with you.'
`It will be dangerous.'
`I don't mind nothing about dangers.
If you'll let me go with you, you shall
have father's dress, and we'll start off
together
.'
Logan reflected a moment. All at once
his countenance brightened. He saw that
to have him with him would be
additional
security, as he being known to be a
fisherman, any companion with him
would pass off without suspicion. He,
therefore, resolved to let him accompany
him; and he believed that he could make
him useful, for he seemed to possess
qualities which would make him a
valuable
adjunct in any secret expedition.
`You shall go with me,' he answered
decidedly; `but can you keep my
secret
?'
`Try me.'
`But you might let it out when you
have drank a good deal.'
`If I do, blow me with one of your
pistolets. I was never so tipsy that I
didn't know what I was about. Now,
there's feyther, I seen him get so drunk
he didn't know a tom-cod from an eel.
But I an't so weak-headed. But when
shall we start, chappy?'
`Just before night, so that it will be
dark when we reach the town.'
`But I must go over for the old un!
He'll bust if he stays there all day and
his boat gone. I must go hunt old
Sassafax
!'
`You seem to have quite a fanciful set
of names for your father!'
`Yah! he's a good un and deserves
'em all,' answered the youth coolly. He
then proceeded to light a short pipe,
while Logan began to examine the dress
in which he resolved to return to the
town under cover of the night. He found,
from its size, that Steiny's father was a
very large-framed man, and that he could
wear them over his own apparel. This
he was not a little gratified to ascertain,
which he did by trying on the complete
suit, loose jacket, trousers, long boots,
and tanned leather sea-cap. When he
had put on the cap last of all, and turned
to Steiny for his criticism, the youngster
uttered a tremendous oath in significance
of his entire approval.
`The old man to a scale, but the gills
and flippers!' he said, after a moment's
further inspection.
`You mean my hands and face!'
`Yes! you'd be cocht by 'em before
you'd got three lengths of a boat into
the town. You've got too soft skin and
red cheeks, and your hands are as white
as a cod's belly.
`I can black my hands with mud.'
`Yes, and make 'em smell of fish by
handling some too. But what'll you do
with your face?'
`I'll besmear that.'
`I'll tell you. There's some yellor
ochre in the hill-side back o' the hut;
I'll get some. This, and with a little
brick-dust, I can make you jist as black
as dad.`
`Do by all means, and the sooner
the better. On the whole I think you
had best begin at once, for two reasons;
it will give me some time to practise and
get used to my clothes, and then it may
not be altogether safe to trust the old
man. He may get so wrathy at my taking
his boat, that, if he is choleric at all,
he won't easily forgive me. So I had best
rig up before he comes off; for he may
get some other fishermen to bring him
down!'
`That's true enough. On the whole
I don't believe 'twould be zactly safe to
trust the old Dolphin! He might blab
in his liquor up town, as how he had a
genteel boarder in his family, which
might breed trouble, you know.'
`And I have thought, that, possibly
out of revenge for my taking his boat and
keeping him in town all day, he might
sell his secret to the Oranges for money,
and thus I should be taken or have to
fly.'
`I didn't think of that. So we'll keep
it from the old man; and I'll tell you,
chappy, how we'll manage about the
clothes. When he comes, if he comes
before night, he'll of course find his boat
here. I'll tell him it was brought home
by a strange fisherman, who didn't ask
nothin' for his trouble.'
`You are very shrewd. You would
lead him, then, to suppose it had got
adrift
!'
`Yes. I would then bring him to you
and we'll drink with the old chap; and
if he thinks the dress looks like his, I'll
swear him out of the idea. Give him gin
and he wouldn't know a cobbler from a
King!'
`Then I shall be safe. But if he
should
insist that I had his clothes?'
`Then knock him down! that is the
way I do with him when he's
obstropylus
.'
`Very well; I see you and I are upon
a perfect understanding. Now if you
serve me faithfully in my affairs up town,
I will not only give you money but serve
you to your advantage.'
`I'll do any thing to go agen the
Oranges
.
Fish forever, and down with the
Oranges, is my motto!'
`And a grand motto it is. But now
for the yellow ochre and brick dust!'
`That is the figure. I'll make you look
so like any body else you'll never know
yourself.'
`That is what I should like for a day
or two, till I get matters arranged in
town.'
The lad then left the hut and climbed
a caving bank in the rear after the ochre,
while Logan, congratulating himself upon
the propitious state of his affairs thus far,
and upon the acquaintance of such a fast
friend as Steiny, stood in front of the hut
looking thoughtfully towards the town.
There it lay before him, about a mile
and three quarters distant, the walls of
the fortress upon the point in warlike
relief
,
and beyond it rose the roofs and
towers
of the town, with the tall slender spire
of Trinity Church crowning and giving
character to the whole. As far as his
eye could reach on the west of the town
extended the Hudson till the bold walls
of the palisades shut in the view. The
East River stretched northward on the
east side of the town, with a few vessels
lying near the shore and wharves;
opposite
the town rose abruptly from the
water
the cliff-like promontory at the
western
extremity of Long Island, dark with
forest trees. Beneath it, crowded close
to its base, were two or three huts for
drying fish. All around him the view
was extensive, and characterised by
islands
and water, and headlands,
dispersed
over the landscape in the most
picturesque variety. To the south and
east stretched the channel to the sea,
which lay broad and blue beneath the
sunlight, the only object visible upon it
the far distant ship which bore the
fortunes
of the late catholic governor to the
shores of Europe.
`I also ought to be on my way to
England
,'
said Logan as his eyes, turning
from all the rest of the wide view around
him, rested thoughtfully upon the
snow-white
spec that was rapidly blending with
the horizon. `I should be in that vessel
with my relative; but I cannot quit the
Province and leave my heart behind! I
must see this fair girl, and know from
her own lips whether I can have any
hope at her hands. It is in vain for me
to try and reason myself out of this
passion
,
or to laugh myself out of it. The
maiden has entranced me. My soul is
ensnared like a bird in a net, and it is
useless for me to try and break the
meshes. I feel an instinctive hope that I
am not indifferent to her. But all must
not be trusted to glances of the eye. I
must see and speak with her. I will
know the worst or the best. And there
is yet a higher motive which prompts me
to linger here; and this is to endeavor to
retrieve my folly in losing the fort as I
did this morning. If that tall, traitorous
sergeant, Graff, falls into my hands, he
shall, in five minutes after he is in my
power, be shorter by the head! Never
was surprise more complete than mine
in finding the gate closed upon me. I
owe my safety to the madness of the
multitude
;
for if Jacob Leisler had not
turned
to correct the error into which they
seemed to have fallen, I should have
found it difficult to have got away as I
did. I will not leave the Province until
I make an effort to retrieve my honor in
this matter. So, between love and war,
I have enough to do in yonder fair town,'
he added, fixing his gaze upon it, and
recalling the image of the lovely Bertha,
who seemed to his love's eye a divinity
which hallowed it.
Steiny now made his appearance
holding
in his hand several little pencils of
ochre, which he had found in the clay of
the hill. Logan, by his direction, sat
down upon a rock in front of the hut,
and proceeded to let him rub his face
with the dingy chrome.
`There, you are now quite
respectable
,'
said Steiny; `but you look too
much like an orange for me, so I will try
a little brick dust!'
This was applied to the yellow ground
and diligently rubbed into the pores of
the skin by Steiny with his fingers. The
ears and his hands were not excepted.
`Now you will do when you have
rubbed
your skin over with a piece of old
canvass,' said the boy, surveying him.
Logan performed this finishing part of
the process, and then looking at his face
in the bright hilt of his sword, saw
reflected
as dark and brown a visage as
even Steiny's father could boast of. His
disguise was complete.
CHAPTER VI.
THE DISGUISED SECRETARY
`
There
is no danger of detection in
this guise,' said Logan to the boy; `if I
should come in front of myself in a
mirror
,
I should never suspect who the
gentleman
was.'
`Praps you'd ask him if he had any
fish to sell!' observed Steiney, who seemed
highly pleased at the transformation his
skill had effected.
`But will this wash off?'
`Yoh, as quick as water touches it,'
responded the boy; `so you will have to
keep watch on it.'
Logan, now transformed, as to
externals
,
into as rough a looking fisherman
as ever took fish over to the town, to sell
in the market-place, wandered about the
rocks, impatiently waiting for the
approach
of night. He dined on boiled
mackerel, with Steiney, acting as
amateur
cook, greatly to the astonishment of
Steiney, who, from the first, seemed to
look upon him as incapable of doing any
thing; for when he looked at his white,
small hand, it did not appear that it had
ever been soiled. But, when he beheld
how handily he cooked the dinner, his
respect for him was very greatly raised.
After dinner, they both went out from
the shore, in their skiff and smoked their
pipes and caught fish.
`Ods fish, master Logan,' said the boy,
on seeing how skillfully he plied the hook,
`you fish as if you had been brought up
to it.'
`I have fished a good deal, Steiney, in
the brooks of England.'
`What kind o' fish scalers do you catch
in brooks?' asked Steiney, with a sneer.
`Trout, and other brook fish.'
`What kind o' bait do you use?' asked
Steiney, drawing up a small cod, and
slatting it off his hook into the bottom of
the boat.
`Flies!'
`Flies?'
`Yes. The trout feed on flies that
dart about over the water. They catch
them by jumping at them. So, by taking
a fly, or a bait made in imitation of the
flies they like, and playing it above the
water, they see it, and spring out after
it.'
`That must be pretty sport,' answered
the boy. `But what is here? Here
comes a boat from the town, and it is got
close to us, afore we see it.'
`It is a pirogue and two men in it,'
cried Logan.
`Yah, and one on em is old Haddock.'
`What, your father!'
`Yah. Now look out for thunder!
But he don't know you have brought his
boat, so he can't quarrel with you yet,
unless he twigs his jacket.'
Logan now drew in his line, and
watched
the advancing skiff with great interest.
It brought not only the owner of the boat
he had taken away, but what was of more
interest to him, news from the town, as
to the state of affairs.
As soon as the boat got within hailing
distance, a large stout fisherman stood up,
and hailed:
`Ho, hillo there, Steiney! Have you
seen any thing of my scow? Some
villain
has stole it, and I have had to get
neighbor Beck to bring me down!'
`Aye, yah, dad! The scow is safe.
Just take a squint ashore, under the black
rock, and you'll see it, safe and sound.'
The fisherman placed his hollowed fist
to one eye, and closing the other, looked
in shore, and at length discovered it.
He announced his satisfaction by an
enormous
oath, and an expression of wonder
how it got there.'
`It got tired of waiting for you, up
town, dad, and so pulled home itself,'
answered
Steiney, as the boat containing
his father, and a fisherman who lived on
Staten Island below, came along side of
the skiff.
`No, did it though?' asked the old man,
as if he did not like to believe it, yet did
not know how to doubt it. `You are
lying, Steiny.'
`Then, how did your boat get home?'
`Sure enough,' answered the man,
puzzled and rubbing his lofty, seamed
forehead. He then cast his eyes upon
Logan, who was quietly watching his
countenance, which was as hard featured,
rum-preserved a visage, as ever passed
under his observation. The old fellow
was about fifty years of age, tall and large
boned, with a face as brown as if his
complexion had been composed of ochre
and brick dust. He wore a short
fishing
jacket, and dutk shorts. Upon his
head was stuck a faded, red woolen cap,
and his feet and legs were bare. His
small, grey watery eye fell on Logan
inquiringly
,
as if he might have something
to do with the mysterious movements of
his boat.
`Who is this, Stein?'
`The man that brought your boat
home. I suppose you forgot to fasten it,
and it got adrift! He didn't ask
anything
either, and ought to make you pay.'
`He's a right good neighbour,'
answered
old Sneck; `but it seems to me,
friend, I've seen you afore. There's
somethin' about ye kind o' familiar, but
I can't call ye by name.'
Logan and Steiney exchanged glances.
They both saw that what was familiar
about him was the jacket and shorts and
old hat; and instead of recognising them
to be his he had the notion that it was the
man in them he recognised.
`I dare say; I have often been up in
town,' answered Logan, enjoying the old
man's perplexity, who still closely
observed
him and his dress; but not as if
he suspected the costume was his own,
but as if trying to recal the man. He at
length shook his head.
`Blessed like somebody, but I'm
hooked
in the gills, if I can tell who.
Familiar
as my hand, and yet I couldn't
swear I'd ever seen you! Where did
you say you lived?'
`About in spots here and there.'
`Where did you pick up my boat?'
`Up the harbour a piece.'
`Was it alone?'
`Yes, and the oars in it.'
`And so you knew it and brought it
home? I wish you'd towed it back to
the town, for I've had a devil of a time of
it! I got ready to start and found it
gone, and searched the whole shore up
and down; but it was not to be seen fin
nor tail. So I was sure it was stole.
Then I went off to the new Governor and
complained to '
`Who is the new Governor?' demanded
Logan, in a tone so quick and startling
that the old man looked upon him with a
broad stare, as also did his comrade.
`Why one would think you were
hailin'
a mast head, friend. Who is the new
Governor? Pray when did you leave the
town that you dont know that?'
`This forenoon. But what is this
news?'
`Why, then, I'll tell ye,' answered
Sneck; and he stepped into the boat,
seeing that the Staten Island man was
impatient to go on his way, which he
pursued
as soon as the old man left his skiff.
`You see there's the old Gov. Dongan
giv up first the other day and got aboard
the vessel that is gone. Well, things
growd worse, and last night Nich
follered
without sayin a word to any body.
Well, you know that dare-devil secretary,
Logan, of his, Dongan's nephew?'
Logan and Steiney both professed the
most entire ignorance of any such person,
and Sneck went on:
`Well, he is a nobleman's son, from
over sea, and ony come out to the
Province
on a lark, as I s'pose; for I don't
see what good he had done by coming,
except set the girls heads crazy ater him.
Well, he wouldn't go with Nich and staid
behind in the fort and swore he'd keep it
till King William came for it! That's
what they say in town. But afterwards,
you see he thought he'd have to give it
up, and so he writ to the rich merchant
Jake Leisler, tellin him that if the town
would raise ten thousand dollars he'd
surrender
without fightin; which must ha'
gone heavy agen his grain, for they say
he loves fightin as fish do watr. Jacob
sets the bells to ringin and calls the town
together. That was the ringin' we
hear, Steiney, just afore I put off. Well
the town wouldn't agree to it, and Jacob
made 'em a speech and they took his
advise
and sent to this Jack-a-lantern
Logan
to surrender. He laughed at the
community and told 'em to go back and
send Jacob Leisler, for to him he had
writ the letter and he wanted to see what
he had to say.'
`I know old Jacob Leisler, dad,' said
Steiney. `Onct I sold him two cod and
he gave me a shillin piece, and when I
was goin to give the change he told me
to kaep it. He's a man for me!'
`Well,' continued Sneck, `he went to
the fort-gate to see what he wanted and
axed Jacob to come inside and have a
talk; but Jacob didn't like to trust
himself
in the hands of such a wild chappy,
and so said he would hear what he had
to say there. But master Logan didn't
care to speak out afore his soldiers what
he wanted to tell him, and so he opens
the gate and walks out to him. Well,
they walked together a bit, though
nobody
knows what he said, and by and by
Jacob was seen to get angry and leave
him. Then our chappy goes to get in
the fort agen and the soldiers wouldn't
let him come in. They hurrard for king
William, fired the guns and set the whole
town in a muss. The people thought the
guns was bein fired at them and they
started down to take the fort. But Jacob
told 'em it wos for the Orange King and
the fort was theirs! He then turned
about to catch the chappy Logan and he
was off, not a soul could tell how! All
this is great news, friends; for the fort
was took at once, the sojers disarmed
and Master Jacob Leisler was made
captain
in it and Governor!'
`Jacob Leisler governor?' exclaimed
Logan.
`Yes, and a good majestic Governor he
makes as the best of 'em. When I went
before him tellin me about my skiff, he
received me as if I'd been a gentleman
and listened to all I said, though twenty
were about him; and told me if I didn't
find it he would pay me for its loss!'
`That was liberal,' remarked Logan.
`But do you say he has assumed the
power
and authority of Governor of the
Province
?'
`I dont know what you call assume;
but I know he is chosen Governor, and
stays in the castle, and has chose a
council
and raised five train-band companies,
and made captains and put guards all
about the city, and acts in every thing
the same as Governor Andross used to
do in his day. If you want to see war go
to town, for there's plenty of soldiers in
the streets and in the fort; and not a
papist
dare show his head without a yellow
ribbon on his hat!'
`Can all this be true?'
`I guess it is, chappy. You never see
sich times. There is brave drinkin in the
tap-rooms and seven shillins to every man
that'll list in the train-bads. Arter I'd
lost my boat I thought I'd have to turn
soger. But look-a-here, chappy, will you
tell me where I've seed you afore now?'
`I guess only in town about the fish
market.'
`Where did you say you lived?'
`Along shore.'
`Well, I dont swear to your face for
certain, but a Guinea black nigger if I
wont swear to your jacket, and your
shorts too. I've seen em afore!'
`Feyther, come, let's take a drink all
round,' said Steiny, who thought the
recognition
was becoming too close; and,
taking from the caddy a small black
bottle
,
he poured into a mug a stout dram,
and handed it to the old man, who took
it down at a gulp.
`More, Steiny, more!' he cried,
holding
out the cup.
`Wait till it goes round, dad. Come
neighbor, drink.'
Logan touched it to his lips and
passed
it to the old man, saying
`You need it, uncle, more than I do.'
Sneck did not wait to be twice invited
in a matter of that kind. He placed the
mug to his lips and slowly emptied it, his
eyes resting still upon a peculiar patch
in the thigh of the shorts. Logan
noticed
his observance and changed his
position
.
In doing so he brought to view a
still more remarkable patch, when the old
man's eyes brightened up and he sprung
up, with a slap upon his knee, crying
`I'm dd if them shorts aint mine!
Steiny, he's a thief! He stole my boat
and shorts! That's my jacket and hat
too! I'd know em in Jerusalem!' and
the old fisherman sprung forward to
grapple
with the supposed thief.
`Stop, old shark!' cried Steiny,
catching
him by the waistband and holding
him back. `You are drunkyou dont
know nothin!'
`Steiny let me go! Aint that my cap?'
`No!'
`Nor my jacket?'
`No!'
`Nor my shorts?' depressing his voice
at each inquiry, perfectly confounded by
Steiny's assurance.
`No, dad. Its the gin you've taken.
You see double, and think every thing
that another has on is yours'
`Give me some more liquor, Steiny,'
said the old man, sinking back upon the
thwart of the boat. `If I'm drunk I axes
neighbor's pardon.'
He then drank off a third mug of
liquor
,
and Logan then suggested to
Steiny
that they had best pull in shore. The
old man made no reply, but steadily eyed
the patch. He was, however, growing
so tipsy that Logan felt no further
solicitude
about his recurring to the subject.
Upon reaching the shore, the old
fisherman
was roused at the sight of his boat
lying there. He staggered towards it,
stumbled into it, and fairly embraced it
in his arms, addressing it with all the
puling childishness of inebriety.
Leaving
the boat, at Steiny's urging, he then
grasped Logan's hand and thanked him
over and over again with tipsy solemnity,
for bringing the boat back; but at every
few words he would utter some
expression
that betrayed his perplexity touching
the resemblance of the jacket to his own.
`You must make him drunk before he
gets into the hut,' said Logan, whispering
to his young coadjutor, `or he will
trouble
me.'
`I'll do it, chappy,' answered the youth;
and turning to his father he proposed
that he should drink the good neighbor's
health, who had brought back his boat.
To this proposition the old fisherman
was nothing loth; and as Steiny
continued
to ply him, by the time they got to the
door of the cabin the old man's legs
failed
under him.
He, however, staggered in and threw
himself upon his bed, and was soon in a
state of thorough insensibility.
`You came pretty near being found
out, chappy,' said Steiny, as his father
gave signs of oblivion to all worldly
matters
,
but he was too misty in the outset
to be sure, and now he's fixed till
to-morrow
morning.
`You have shown yourself sharp
witted
and a good friend to me,' said Logan.
`I shall not forget you.'
`When are we to start to go up to
town?' he asked, with youthful
impatience
.
`I want to see some of this
warlike
stirring going on. I never saw a
man killed in my life.'
`There has been no one killed, nor
perhaps will there be at present,'
answered
Logan; `but we will start in about
half an hour. It is now within an hour
of sun-down.'
`Are you the chappy, then, the old
Gin-bottle talked so sweetly about?'
`Yes,' answered Logan, smiling at the
manner and tone in which the inquiry
was put.
`Well, didn't he give it to you under
his jacket?'
`I bore it quietly.'
`Not a wince; but you had an escape
of it, tho'. If it had not been for dad's
boat they'd ha' got ye, may be!'
`It would have gone hard with me.
Indeed, perhaps I owe my life to finding
it.'
`Well, I'm glad they didn't catch you.
You see that old Tom Cod is an Orange
man!'
`Yes, I perceive he is by his speech.
It will not do to trust him.'
`Not a bit.'
`And you spoke in favor of Jacob
Leisler. Are you a Protestant?'
`I don't know. I'm fish agen Orange.
`Still you like Leisler.'
`He spoke me kindly once, and
wouldn't take the change for fish.'
`But he is a Protestant.'
`I don't know what kind of fish that
is.'
`He isn't a Roman Catholic, I mean.'
`What is that?'
`One who obeys the Pope.'
`Pope! I have seen a Pope-fish! But
they bite like a shark.'
`Don't you know any difference
between
Papist and Protestant?'
`Never heard of such fish.'
`King James was a Papist. The
Orange King is a Protestant.'
`I go dead agen Orange, salt or fresh,'
answered Steiny, who was independently
ignorant of all religious politics, and
whose politics were defined and limited
to `fish' and `orange.' These, in his
mind, were the two great designating
term to distinguish the adherents to the
two crowns.
Logan regarded him with unfeigned
surprise. He could not believe that there
was to be found one so near a maritime
town who knew nothing about religion:
to whom the great rallying words `
Protestant'
and `Papist' were wholly
unknown
.
The sun was slowly falling towards
the west when they entered their boat
and pulled out from the island towards
the town. It was a bright afternoon, and
the waters reflecting the brilliant golden
hues of the western sky, shone like a
gilded mirror. Here and there was
visible
a fisherman's skiff, gliding across the
harbor homeward from town, pulling
either to the Jersey shore or one of the
islands. Over the town hung a low blue
wreath of smoke, above which, piercing
it, rose the needle-like spire of Trinity,
always a prominent object in the scene;
but now rising alone above the azure
cloud like a beacon from the bosom of
the blue deep, it presented an interesting
appearance, and even drew the attention
of Steiny, who paused in his rowing to
point it out to Logau's admiration.
At length the broad red disc of the
sun glided away into the western world,
leaving behind him a glorious pathway
of colored light. A gun was fired from
the fort, announcing the sunset, and the
flag was lowered from the staff. The
twilight was soft and glowing and
lingering
.
Before it deepened into the shadows
of the night, the moon arose and flung
her silvery scarf across the waters of the
harbor; and above her car sparkled the
planet Venus, like a diamond swinging
in the skies: By the light of the moon
Logan directed Steiny to pull into the
mouth of the fosse, at the very point
from which he had in the morning taken
his departure.
Having sprung to the land and assist
ed Steiny in drawing the skiff under a
sort of hanging bridge, which was
extended
from the outer wall of the fort to
the decks of vessels where stores and
ammunition
were being discharged, he took
the young man by the arm and walked
with him up a narrow causeway of stone
that was built to protect the shore from
the encroachments of the waves. A few
trees growing along the inner verge of
this causeway, the first beginning of
what constitutes at the present day the
magnificent Battery, cast their shadows
across and concealed in a degree their
progress. All this time they were
leaving
the citadel on their left hand.
At length they came into a street that
led obliquely from the harbour in the
direction
of the Green.
Here and there a light glimmered from
the dwellings or shops, and one or two
persons were moving past at a quick step.
One of them being challenged in a low
quick tone, as he reached the head of
the street, recalled to Logan what the old
fisherman had told him and warned him
of the danger he was running in thus
entering the town.
`We shall be stopped, unless we are
very wary,' said Logan to his
companion
,
as they stood under the shadow of
the last tree of the causeway, which also
flung its branches half way across the
street that they had reached. `Go you
forward, Steiny, and get as near the
sentinel
as possible, and then conceal
yourself
till you can catch the countersign,
that is the word that men give when they
are challenged by the soldiers. I will
await you here.'
The next moment the lad was
worming
his way along in the direction of the
sentry, with the noiseless celerity of a
serpent.
CHAPTER VII.
THE PATROLES.
The
fisher's boy, Steiney, at length
reached, unobserved, to the stoope of an
old Dutch house, where he concealed
himself, within ten feet of the Sentinal
who paced to and fro on the corner of
the street, his match-lock at his shoulder.
After he had been thus ensconsed
about ten minutes, he heard a foot-step
approaching. The man came nearer and
nearer, and, when within twenty feet of
Steiney, was abruptly challenged by the
Sentinel in broken Dutch,
`Who guesh dere?'
`The Prince,' answered the man.
`Goot!' responded the Sentry,
carrying
his musket to his shoulder; pass on
de vay vhere you is goin.'
The citizen passed on and Steiney
taking
advantage of the soldier's face being
turned the other way, stole from his
hiding
place, and safely reached Logan.
`Well, what is the word?' demanded
the disguised young Secretary quickly,
advancing, as he spoke, from out of the
covert of the tree.
`When any body is asked who they
be,' answered Steney, `they says `The
Prince!'
`Did you hear this reply?'
`Yes,' answered the boy, `a man said
Prince, and the soger let him go by.'
`That is enough, you have done your
errand well, I would not have missed
your company on this expedition, Steiney,
for a good deal. Come, let us march.'
`Which way?'
`I will tell you by and by,' answered
Logan
,
crossing the street and taking the
side-walk up to where it joined Wall
street. As he approached the sentry,
at the corner, he assumed a swaggering
gait, and advanced with an air of
confidence
.
The gun of the soldier was
brought to the present, and the challenge
`Who goesh along dere?' fell loudly
upon
their ears.
`The Prince,' answered Steiney,
quickly
,
getting out the word before Logan
could speak it.
`Den you may goesh, fishermens,'
responded
the heavy Dutch soldier,
carrying
arms again, and stepping back, so
that they might pass.
`You seem to keep vigilint watch here,
in the town, good man,' said Logan
stopwing
,
and addressing him. `What is
the state of things just now? Is all quiet?'
`Notin but what is as quiet as a mouse,'
answered the man.
`The streets are filled with sentries, I
find.'
`Yash, Governor Leisler know how to
keep de papist still. He goot
Governorsh
.'
`So no papist is allowed to stir out,
hey?'
`Not a nose or fingers,' responded the
man, stoutly.
`Except they show the yellow ribbon?'
`Yash, if dey show dat, den dey be let
alone.'
`Have many of them worn the badge?'
`Yash, goot many on em.'
`Do you know where Bayard, or
Courtlandt are?'
`In dere housh. Day no been out on
em to day. We hab de town all to
ourself
.
Be ye de fisherman dat lost de
boat?'
`Has it been found?' asked Logan,
gratified to find his disguise so perfect.
`I does'nt know dat. Peoplesh did say
dat de young Mynheer Logan, was seen
by a womans from her window, paddlin
off in such a boat; but she did'nt tell it
till the whole day was gone, and he got
away.'
`I wish I could have caught him,' said
Steiney.
`And the Governorsh wish so too,'
answered
the Sentinel; `and he'll pe caught
soon; for the Governorsh's excellency
means to give one hundred silver marks
to any man dat will find him. So
fishermen
,
as folks think he is down among
de islands, dere is a goot occasions dat
you may be rich men's.'
`So there is,' answered Logan; `I
shall take good care to look him up.
Good night, brave sentry.'
`Goot night, fishing-peoples,'
responded
the Dutchman, as Logan and Steiney
moved on.
`I'm glad, chappy, we hearn that,'
said the latter, as they got out of
hearing
.
`Yes; I see that I shall have to be on
the look out, even at the island, or I shall
be taken. It is in your power, Steiney,'
he said turning to the boy, and laying his
hand firmly but kindly on his shoulder;
`it is in your power, while I am in town,
to betray me. One word from you would
place the hundred marks offered by
Leisler
,
in your pouch. But do you know
that I believe you would sooner cut off
your right hand than betray me.'
`You say true, chappy. If I thought
you had doubted me, I would pay you for
it by getting you into trouble. But
because
you trust me, I will let them kil
me before they find out, from me, who
you are.'
`I understood you well, you see. Are
you ready now, to serve me in all I shall
ask of you?'
`Yah, to go and take this Orange
Governor by the head and heels and carry
him down to the island and make you
Governor in his place!'
`Then we are inseperable. Here, we
turn into Nassau street and thence into
Maiden Lane; for I am going to stop
first at the house of this Mynheer
Leisler
!'
`I know where he lives. He bought
fish of me once,' answered Steiney,
pulling
at his waist bands as he tramped
along by the side of Logan. A few steps
from the corner they were a second time
challenged and passed on. The streets,
though the hour was early, were deserted,
save by the sentries. The doors of the
houses were closed and barred and most
of the windows on the lower stories shut
and bolted. Here and there a light shone
from an upper window, and occasionally
a head was seen stealthily peering from a
pane of glass.
At the junction of the street with
Maiden Lane a patrol of a dozen armed
men came suddenly upon them round the
corner. Logan stood perfectly still to
let them pass. But when he saw their
leader he felt inclined to retire with
precipitation
,
for he recognised in him the
tall sergeant Graff who had betrayed him.
But to escape would have been
impossible
.
He summoned his self-possession
and whispered to Steiny,
`If he speaks, you reply; I am
deaf!
`Ho, men, stand if ye be good men
and true!' cried the sergeant as he came
near; `what is the word by which honest
people pass free in these times?'
`The Prince,' answered Steiny boldly.
`Very good. But are you not
fishermen
?
What are you doing here in the
town at this hour? The Governor hath
commanded that every one who dwelt
not in town and had his occupation here
should depart to his home at sun-down.
Ho, you fellow, why are you here?'
`Dick, is deaf as a haddock; he got
deaf livin' on them kind o' fish. You
see we had our skiff stole and can't get
home.'
`Ho, so you are the men, hey, that
lost your skiff?'
`Yes, and if the Governor wants us to
go off to island he must send us, for we
ha'nt fins to swim.'
`Well answered, boy; very well
answered
.
How came you by the pass
word?'
`Didn't he give it to us that we might
stay and look up the thief what stole our
scow!'
`True enough. If he didn't give it
you couldn't have it. But it seems to
me, old fellow, you want deaf to-day,' he
cried, shouting in Logan's ear, `when
you went to the governor and told your
story. You made so much noise we all
wished we were deaf.'
`Deaf people ol'ays thinks every body
else deaf,' answered Steiny.
`That's true. Well, go and catch the
thief if you can; but if it is the man I
think it is I hope you wont find him very
soon.'
`Who do you think it is?' asked
Steiny.
`The young master Logan! If he
didn't get off in your skiff I don't know
where he is. All I wish is that he may
get away and trouble us no more. If he
is taken he will swing for it, and I like
him too well to wish to see the poor young
gentleman die!'
`How can you say that, Graff?' said
one of his party, `when you gave up the
fort by shutting him out!'
`Well, I didn't shut him out because
I had any thing against him, but because
I saw that if things went on there'd be
blood spilled; and so I thought it best to
stop mischief. I told Mynheer Leisler
the same, as boldly as I speak it now;
for I told him Mynheer Logan had
always
treated me well, and I wished no
harm to him; for I had not forgotten
how kind he always was to me and any of
the garrison that got sick. I suppose he
hates me for what I did; but if I could
ever see him I'd tell him I did it for his
good and the country's; and that I'd
quicker serve him now than any other
man, if I could do it without betraying
the present cause!'
`If I said such worts, Graff,' spoke the
one who had before replied to him, `it
would go hard with me with the
Governor
.
But you are a favorite.'
`Governor Leisler knows me to be
honest, and that I shall serve the
Province
no worse for wishing well to master
Logan. But march, soldiers! When
you find your boat, men, let me know.'
The patrole passed on. Logan stood
a moment looking after it, and then said
to Steiny,
`I have a good friend yet, I see, in the
man I most feared!'
`He didn't know who he talked to, I
guess, said Steiny laughing. `But, if I
was you I would n't trust him; for he'd
give you up, because he's one o' those
kind o' men that would think he'd have
to, since he served the Orange Governor.
For all he has said, chappy, he'd think
more o' the Province than his likin for
you!'
`I dare say you are right. But here
we are near the abode of Jacob Leisler.
It is closed up, save a light streaming
from an opening in the shutter above.
Now, Steiny, I want you to go and knock
at the door, and ask for the Governor. I
wish to know whether he is in the castle
or not. If they say he is at the castle,
then ask for Bertha Leisler, his daughter;
for she may be with him, and I wish to
ascertain.'
`Well, chappy, and what shall I say?'
`I will tell you. I love that young
maiden, Steiny, but I am not sure that
she loves me or thinks of me. Now I
want you, if you ascertain that she is
there to say that you want to see her
alone.'
`I was never alone with a girl in my
life without bein scared,' answered
Steiny
.
`She wont hurt you. Begin and tell
her about the loss of your skiff, and how
you wish her to ask her father to pay you
for it, as he had promised your father;
and I wish you to tell her you hear the
Secretary Robert Logan, had escaped in
it; and then watch her face, and in your
own way, by adroit words, draw from
her what her opinion is and whether you
think a visit to her would be acceptable
from me.'
`I understand, chappy. You want me
to bait the hook while you catch the fish.'
`Yes; I want you to ascertain by your
own wit whether it would be safe for me
to see her and to let her know that I was
in her power.'
`I'll do it!'
`Be discreet!'
`Yah, I know what to do. But where
are you going?'
`I have some person to see farther up
town. In one hour you will find me
seated
upon the platform of the well there.'
As he spoke he pointed across the street
to a circular well, which was used as the
public fountain by the whole street.
`But I will wait first to see if you are
admitted
.'
Steiny approached the house, and
ascending
by three steps to the stoope,
knocked upon the door. He waited full
a minute and repeated the knock. There
was a slight noise over his head at the
window shutter; it was softly and
carefully
pushed open, and a face appeared
looking down:
`Who is it?' demanded the rich-toned
voice of Bertha Leisler.
Logan's heart bounded. He was
almost
of a mind to bound across the street
and answer, `It is I, dearest Bertha!'
But he feared it would have alarmed her,
as most likely, and also have defated all
his hopes, for he was not like a lover
who has confidence in the affection of
her he loves; but he was uncertain
whether
she cared for him; nay, whether, if
she had him in her power, she would not
without hesitation give him up to her
father
.
`It is Steiny Sneck,' responded the
boy.
`And who is Steiny Sneck?' asked
Bertha, firmly.
`I'm a fisher from the island.'
`So I see you are a fisher by your
dress,' answered Bertha; for the
moonlight
shone broad upon the stoope and
fell upon him. `But what do you here?
This is no time to be abroad startling
people, when the town is full of tumults.
What is thy wish? tell speedily and be
away, or the guard will trouble thee!'
This was spoken partly as if with a
desire to terminate the interview, and
partly from an apparent wish to keep the
youth from falling into the hands of the
patrole.
`I am the son of the man who had the
scow stole, pretty mistress, and I want to
see the Governer!'
`The Governor? there is no
Governor
!'
Governor Leisler!'
`True, true; I had forgotten it; he
is
the Governor. But my father is at the
citadel engaged in mighty matters!'
`I want him to give me pay for my
boat.'
`He will to-morrow.'
`I must buy another and go home
tonight
,
or I shall be put in prison; for that
is the law, they say.'
`True, true! Poor youth! Is no one
with thee?'
`No, pretty lady.'
`Well, tell me how much thy boat is
valued at.'
`Three marks and a half.'
`Then I will pay thee in the
Governor's
name. Wait till my maid opens the
door to thee.'
The fair head disappeared from the
window and the shutter was drawn to.
Steiny rubbed his hard bony hands with
delight.
Logan would have taken this
opportunity
to have run forward and joined
Steiny
and gone in with him, feeling secure
in his disguise, since he had defied
Graff's scrutiny. But Steiny, by saying
that he was alone, prevented him from
obeying this impulse; for if, when she
opened the door, she beheld two instead
of one, she would have been alarmed and
closed it upon them. He, therefore, saw
that his only way was to leave the first
interview with Steiny alone, who had
shown talent enough to manage it.
Logan's
surprise at finding her at home
instead
of at the fort with her father, was
only equalled by his joy.
The bolt of the door was carefully
drawn and the door partly opened,
showing
a middle-aged Dutch woman in a
white cap, and blue handkerchief tied
about her neck. Holding the door
nearly
too, she put out her hand, in which
were the three marks and a half, and
said
`Here, lat; here is ty monies, mistress
send tee. You must not come in these
wars times.'
`Tell your pretty mistress,' answered
Steiny, who saw that his prospect of
seeing
Bertha was likely to be defeated by
this wariness, `tell her if she is the
daughter
of Governor Leisler, I have something
to say to her very particular.'
`What is it you would say, fisher?
called out Bertha, from the hall behind
the servant.
`What none by thy own ear must hear,'
answered Steiney.
`Stand aside, Brecket,' said Bertha,
`and let me hear his errand.'
`I cannot speak it here, the soldiers
coming by, may see me, and carry me
off, for all you couldsay. There comes a
patrol of them now, up the street. I must
either go off out o' the way and sight or
be let in.'
`Let him in, mistress; he is but a boy;
and Mynheer Von Vow said, let no man
in.'
`I heed not what the burgomaster said
or said not,' answered Bertha. `If you
have words for my ear, come in quickly,
ere thou art seen.'
Steiney glided in, the door was closed
upon him, and the very next moment
appeared
Mynheer Van Vow, at the head
of his patrol, which, he had taken from
the fort for the special protection of the
dwelling of the lovely Bertha. Logan
had only time to withdraw into the shade
of the low eaves of a shed opposite, and
escape being seen, though he recognised
the valiant burgomaster, who, as Jacob
Leisler had told him, was the betrothed
husband of Bertha Leisler. He felt at
once, the most decided dislike to little
Van Vow, and, if little Van Vow had
been aware of his presence, and his
attachment
to Bertha, he would doubtless,
have taken quite as strong a dislike to
him.
`Soldiers, halts!' cried the
burgomaster
.
His guard came to a full stand, and
somewhat in a heap.
`Dress dere! Strait lines, all of yous!
Shoulters arms, and carry your heats
ups!'
These orders were obeyed with about
the same precision with which they were
given.
`Vera goots,' exclaimed the
burgomaster
,
seeing then place themselves in
near-a
semicircle. `Now lets me gif you your
order. You vil keeps garts here till
twelve o'clocks, ant let no poty in, as
dont say `Slems,' and nopoty out as dont
say `Slems.' Now I goes in to smoke
mine bipes, mit te Governorsh daughters,
and tell her not to pe afrait; for I haf
brot te bravest gart of soldiers, to keep
gart at her doors, as is in all New Yorks.'
`A plague on that crack-brained
simpleton
,'
exclaimed Logan, as he saw him
go to the door and rap upon it, with the
hilt of his huge sword. `She cannot care
a fig for him. I will yet circumvent him
to his hearts' content. Let me wait and
see if he is let in. There is the window
open, above the door, again.'
Who is it hammerin at the door?'
called
out the shrill voice of Brecket.
`It ish me, te burgomaster,' answered
Mynheer Van Vow, with great
confidence
.
`Vell, ant what ish te matter?'
`Tell my beloved Bertha, goot Vrow,
tat I am here, wit a garts of brave mens
almost as myself, to keep her from alarms
and thongers; ant tat I vill come in and
smoke a bipe a little while.
`I will tell her,' answered Brecket,
returning from the window; while
Logan
waited with curiosity, the issue. In
a few moments he returned.
`Mynheer burgomaster?'
`Vel, Vrow Brecket.'
`My mistress says she is very much
obliged to you for your gart, and says
when you want to go into barrachs, to
smoke, there is the fort.'
`The sweet Bertha is very witty,'
answered
the burgomaster.
`She bade me say too that she thinks
you can keep betters guards, outsides dan
ins.'
With these words. the house-keeper
shut down the window, and Mynheer sat
down upon the stoope, deliberately
lighted
his pipe, and, leaning upon his sword,
began to amuse himself with smoking
and dreams of love; for this
discomfiture
,
in no degree troubled him. Every
rebuff of the kind he took with simple
good feeling, and thought neither less of
himself, nor of Bertha, therefor.
Perhaps
his philosophy was based upon the
comforting assurance, that she was
destined
to be his vrow, at all events in due
time, however wilful and wayward she
now chose to be.
Logan rematned till he saw the
burgomaster
as comfortable as if he had not
a thought beyond his pipe, and his brave
troop on which he gazed affectionately as
he smoked. He then moved noiselessly
away, not a little gratified at the answer
Bertha had sent Mynheer Van Vow.
`It is a settled matter,' he said with joy,
as he walked on; `it is clear as the sun,
that she cares nothing for him, but only
endures him. I am elated with hope.
By the good mass! fat and simple
burgomaster
,
if such be her reception of thee,
I will see her this night, before thou dost.
And what will become of thee, Steiney,
thou audacious rogue. It is a good omen
that the fair Bertha would not see the
burgomaster, because she was listening
to thee; and had my name, already fallen
upon her ear? I will know within one
hour, leaving thee, boy, to get out of
the house by thy own wits, as thou
gottest
in.'
`Stand, and give the countersign!' cried
a voice, suddenly, accompanied by the
rattle of a watch-lock.
`Bertha!'
`Not so! You are my prisoner.'
`The Prince!' answered Logan,
correcting
himself, and smiling at his own
mistake.
He was suffered to pass on, and, after
answering the challenges of two more
sentries, he stopped before a gate in a
bye street.
CHAPTER VIII.
THE CONSPIRATORS.
The
gate at which Logan stopped was
in a garden fence on the skirts of the
town. Two large trees grew above it
and intercepted the light of the moon, so
that the spot lay in the deepest shadow.
It was owing to this deep shadow that he
was able to stand unseen close by the
gate until a relief guard marched by in
the middle of the street. When it had
passed he pulled a string that he found
on the side of the gate-post, and waited
for admission. Over the top of the gate
was visible the roof of a house, half
buried in the foliage of the enclosure.
He waited full two minutes, when,
becoming
impatient, as he was about to
apply
his hand to the string a second time,
a footfall was heard within the garden,
approaching the gate.
A low voice called out to know who
was there.
`A friend, father Stephen!'
`The voice of an enemy may use the
language of a friend. What is it you
wish, and who would you see? These
are times when it is safer for men to
keep their doors fast than the hand of
welcome open.'
`I am Robert Logan,' answered the
secretary in a low voice, applying his lips
to the lock of the heavy gate.
`Is it, indeed!' repeated the priest in
tones of joyful surprise. `I should have
known the voice. Who is with thee?'
`No one.'
`I will let thee in presently;' and the
sound of a chain and bar let fall, and
then the noise of a bolt shoved back, were
followed by the cautious opening of the
door.
`Gome in quickly, my son. There are
those about who may see thee. But what,
I know thee not. Am I deeeived!'
`No, father; do not fear; this is but
a disguise.'
`Then enter.'
Logan entered, drawn kindly in by the
priest, who immediately closed the gate
and replaced bar and bolt.
`You seem to take great precaution,
father.'
`I have need to; for whipers have
reached me that public feeling is very
strong against me because I am the
Roman
priest. But where have you been?
How is it that I am so happy as to see
you in safety. I can hardly realize that
it is you. This strange disguise, too,'
cried the priest, holding him where the
moon fell upon his face and dress. Were
it not that the voice were yours, I should
never know you. The face is not yours.'
`I have stained it! I escaped to the
islands! I found a fisherman who
befriended
me, and through him I got this
disguise and conveyance back to the
town, where I have hastened to see what
my friends have done and are doing in
these up and down times.'
`I am glad to see you! There are
others in my house, from whom you will
find welcome, and whom you will be glad
to see. They will be as much surprised
at your coming as I am. We had strange
and painful rumors about you. Some said
you had thrown yourself into the water;
others that you were killed; others said
that you had escaped on board the ship;
while towards night a story went that you
had been seen making your way in a
fisher's skiff towards the islands.'
`The latter is the truth. But whom
shall I meet?'
`Livingstone, the Mayor, Courtlandt,
and others, firm and true Catholics, who
are fired with indignation at the
usurpation
of this Leisler, and are here
assembled
secretly to discuss the affairs of the
province at this crisis.'
`I am come, then, in good time. Are
there any others there that may betray
me?' he asked, as he approached the
door of the priest's abode.
`Not one.'
`Then I will throw off my fisherman's
coat, and appear before them in more
seemly apparel.'
`Leave them in my study, which we
shall first pass through, my son.'
They entered the porch of the house,
and then ths study, where Logan
dropped
his disguise, appearing in his blue
undress uniform, with his sword at his
side, an attire as elegant as it was
becoming
to his fine figure. The priest
stood by and witnessed the instant
transformation
with surprise.
`You are aow yourself again, son,
save the complexion of yoar face.'
`That I dare not remove. My friends
must let me pass as I am.'
The priest now led the way into a
large square inner apartment, lighted by
half a dozen wax candles, placed upon a
sort of altar at one extremity. Several
pictures of saints and one of the
Crucifixion
hung around. In fact, the place
was a private chapel, where not only the
Padre Stephen, but the more devout of
his parishioners were used to perform
their more strict devotions.'
About twenty persons were assembled
in this chamber, all of whom broke off
conversation and directed their eyes to
the door with glances of inquiry and
suspicious
vigilance. They were all armed
and seemed men of substantial character
in the town. Three or four of the more
prominent were standing together near
the candles, conversing closely as the
priest entered leading in Logan. Every
eye was fixed upon his face expecting an
acquaintance, but his visage seemed that
of a stranger. Every one became
cautiously
silent and looked at the padre to
learn from him who his visitor was.
`Gentlemen, under this Indian mask
of ochre is the nephew of Governor
Dongan, who has safely arrived among
us!'
`Logan,' cried the gentlemen nearest
to him coming forward and grasping each
a hand while they stared in his face,
slowly recognising him. `Is it possible
we see you again? How have you
escaped
?'
the asked together.
`In a skiff to the islands, which I left
again at sun-down to come and see what
you are doing. I am glad Mr.
Livingstone
and Mayor Courtlandt,' he added,
pressing the hands of these gentlemen,
`at finding you are here assembled, not
tamely to yield the government. You
will have my earnest co-operation in
whatever
you may decide to do!'
Others now crowded round this
popular
and, with all his gay errors, much
loved young man, and warmly
congratulated
him upon his escape. He then
briefly gratified their curiosity by
explaining
its mode, and how he had
managed
to reach the priest's house, `which,
he said, `he thought would be the most
likely place to hear of what was doing in
behalf of the cause.'
`We were speaking of you and wishing
you with us not five minutes before you
rang the bell at the gate,' said Mr.
Livingstone
,
a small, gentlemanly looking
man of forty-five, with a high bald
forehead
,
a profusely powdered wig, and
dressed in a rich suit of black velvet with
lace ruffles over his hands. His face
wore an agreeably vivacious expression,
and his large full hazle eyes sparkled with
the native cheerfulness of an easy temper.
He was one of the most influential
citizens
of the Catholic party; though as he
was a very liberal Catholic and favored
the Protestants not a little, the latter
claimed him quite as much as the former.
It is probable, therefore, that if they had
called upon him to take the government
instead of Jacob Leisler he might have
accepted it; and instead of being now
one in a Roman Catholic conspiracy,
been ruling the protestant party with the
fortress in his hands. But the accession
of Jacob Leisler at once drove him to the
papal opposition of which he was now
one of the leaders; but more from
political
than religious motives.
By his side, and who had grasped
Logan's
hand at the same time he did, stood
Courtlandt, the Mayor of the town. He
was nominally a Roman Catholic, but
had been edncated a protestant. His
adherence
to the Jame's party in the
provence
had given him the chief ruler-ship in
the town; and thus his interests had been
identified with the papist cause. He was
a thin, sharp-visaged man, of dark
complexioned
and an air at once austere and
dominant. His influence with the Roman
Catholics was not so great as that which
was possessed by Livingstone; yet they
had full confidence in him.
The other persons of the party were
firm and unbending Romonists and men
that the priest could wield and will.
This latter person was a man in the
prime of life. He had been educated at
Rome in the Jesuit college; and
possessed
all the boldness, zeal and blind
attachment to papal supremacy that
marks that extraordinary sect of
religionists
.
He had been in the Province during
the four years, from the accession of
James II. to the present time. His
influence
over the people of his own faith was
singnlarly powerful. He governed them
not only in matters of faith, but in
politics
.
He controuled all the votes of his
parishoners, and thus held the balance of
power. It was by his influence that
Courtlandt had been elected to the office
of Mayor. Had he chosen to have thrown
aside the gown and taken the sword he
would have made an efficient leader.
Had he raised the standard of resistance
to Leisler's power and taken the field in
person he would have overturned the new
government within twenty-four hours
after its organization.
From the reception which Logan met
with by these gentlemen, it will have
been seen that he was far from being an
inconsiderable person with them. As
the Secretary of Gov. Dongan, he had the
controul of a good deal of executive
patronage
,
and having with his uncle much
personal influence he was courted by all
who sought place or favor from the head
of the government. Logan was of the
best blood of England, and was heir
presumptive
to an Earldom. These
circumstances
gave him consideration. He was
also a person of pleasing and popular
address
,
of a high order of talents and a
skilful diplomatist. In fact, Dongan was
only nominally the Governor. The reins
were actually in Logan's hands. Being
naturally gay and fond of pleasure he fell
into some youthful excesses which
brought the censures of the graver
portion
of the citizens upon him; yet with
all this he was popular even with the
protestants
,
towards whom he was always
found more lenient than his uncle.
When at length the latter, from fear
of assassination, retired on board the
Swedish ship a few days prior to the
opening of our story, and surrendered his
authority into the hends of Nicholson, his
Lieutenant-Governor, he would have
prevailed on Logan to follow him on
ship-board. The latter, however, felt no
desire to go, not having any fear for his
life, and being, besides, too deeply
enamoured
with the fair Bertha to leave
her and leave his heart with her without
having declared his passion.
He, therefore, remained with
Nicholson
,
who, finding the excitement
growing
stronger after the resignation of the
Governor, and getting news of the
accession
of William of Orange, he lost all
courage, and followed, under the cover
of night, his predecessor. In vain he
urged Logan to accompany him. `No,'
said he firmly; `I will not desert the
government in this cowardly manner. I
will stay behind, and, by maintaining the
citadel, obtain an honorable
capitulation
.
King James's authority shall not
expire in the province in such disgrace.
I will remain and give the body deeent
burial, if die it must. But I shall keep
life in it so long as I can. Make my
respects
to my uncle, and tell him that i
shall not give up tha authority of King
James until I can surrender it with
honor.'
The manner in which he held the fort,
and the means by which he lost it, are
already known to the reader.
After some minutes' conversation
touching Logan's escape, Father
Stephen
said,
`We were speaking, my son, about
this usurpation of Leisler, and the
manner
in which we can overthrow his
power
.
You have come in good time to give
us the aid of your sword, if need be.'
`Is Leisler, then, so strongly
established
as I hear?' asked Logan with deep
interest, speaking among the gentlemen
with the quick air of one who felt himself
a leader equally with the chief of those
present.
`Yes,' answered Courtlandt, of whom
the inquiry had been more particularly
made, `he took possession of the fort
about nine o'clock this morning; by ten
he had a garrison of his own men in it,
under arms, and his officers chosen. By
eleven he had issued a command for five
train-band companies to be organised;
and by noon he was at the head of a force
of full four hundred men, and the
supreme
authority in his hand.'
`He has moved with activity the most
extraordinary,' continued Mr.
Livingstone
.
`He has placed the town under
martial law, and established, in fact, a
military despotism. He this afternoon
sent a deputatiou to Mayor Courtlandt to
know if he would acknowledge his
authority
and that of the Orange King.'
`And what reply was returned?'
asked
Logan, who listened with the deepest
attention.
`I replied,' answered Mr. Courtlandt,
with his brow darkening, `that I should
acknowledge no usurper, nor an usurper
of a usurper. I defied him.'
`What then?' said Logan eagerly.
`He issues a proclamation,
commanding
all Roman Catholics, Papists, as
he terms us, to remain in our dwellings,
unless we choose to appear abroad
without
arms, and wearing in our hats the
badge of the heretical kinga yellow
ribbon.'
`And some have done this?'
`A few base fellows. But I am glad
Leisler has given us this opportunity of
knowing who are not our friends. All
who would have been false to us have
gone out from us under this yellow flag.
We now know who are our friends, and
can trust them one and all.'
`And, Mr. Livingstone,' said Logan,
`what is it you purpose?in what way
are you to trust our friends?'
`Are you to be told that this is a
conspiracy
,
Robert Logan,' said Father
Stephen
,
`to overthrow Leisler and hold the
government till this news be confirmed.'
`What news?'
`Of William of Orange's succession.
There has been no official notice of it.
For what we know King James II. still
sits on the Catholic throne of England.'
`True, it is but a rumor by the way of
Boston; but I am convinced it will be
confirmed. Andross was overthrown and
imprisoned wholly on account of this
intelligence
.
The Boston citizens must
have known it to be sure; and, though
we got it by rumor thence, it will turn
out to be trne. Still, my friends, I am
ready to act with you. I came back to the
city to-night mainly to consult with you.
Our honor is concerned most intimately
in the recovery of the citadel and the
reestablishment
of the Catholic domination
as it was until we are called upon by a
British King to transfer it to another.
We will then acquiesce. We cannot be
branded as traitors or rebels by doing
this.'
`The power,' said the priest, `is still
lawfully ours; legally it is in the hands
of the Catholics. Leisler's government
is an usurpation. He is a rebel, and will
be declared so by the King he professes
to serve, if we can overthrow his power
and hold it. You, Robert Logan,
represent
Nicholson, and so long as you have
not resigned the authority Nicholson left
with you, the authority is in your own
hand. The new King must receive from
you. Leisler has no power to surrender
it; for he has not
received
but
usurped
it.
By overthrowing him, we can, if we can
do no more, get him declared as a rebel
and a traitor.'
`The new Governor seems to have
acted with decision,' remarked Logan.
`He has established himself firmly. It
will be difficult to overthrow him. The
fort will stand a vigorous defence.'
`Yes, if we attempt to carry it by
assault
,'
answered Courtlandt. `But father
Stephen has suggested a mode that will
be successful if we are true to ourselves.'
`What is this?' asked Logan, with
strong manifestations of interest.
`Next Sabbath,' said father Stephen,
`the protestant citizens are to go to the
conventicle within the fort to have
service
and offer thanks for their victory
and the accession of the Protestant
Prince. Then, gentlemen, is your time
to act. Till that day keep perfectly quiet
and seem to submit to the new rule. On
Sunday send to Leisler to ask permission
to attend the services. If he consents,
which he may do on condition that you
come unarmed and wearing the orange
badge '
`I will not even put on the yellow
ribbon
and wear it an hour to get
posssession
of the fort,' answered Logan with
flashing eyes. `No, no, father Stephen,
I will not wear the Orange badge, not I.
`It may be policy.'
`No. Some other mode must be
suggested
.'
`Well, hear me through, son. I was
about to propose that by adopting the
orange badge you might obtain access to
the interior of the fort and once there
with a select number of bold partizans
get it into your hands. But as this
course is objected to by you, I propose
now what was to have been the
alternative
,
viz: that after they are assembled
in the fort at their prayers you invest it,
enclose them in it and thus compel them
to such terms as you see best to dictate.'
`This is better,' answered Logan.
`When do you say?'
`Next Sabbath.'
`Four days hence. How many armed
men can be relied on to engage in this?'
`Three hundred,' answered Mr.
Livingstone
.
`Are you to organize them?'
`Yes, we will see that all is ready,'
answered
father Stephen, `if you pledge
yourself to lead, and resume the
government
in the name of your uncle!'
`You require from me no pledge. I
am ready to do it as soon as may be. I
must redeem my disgrace in letting the
fort slip out of my hands as it did!'
`Then all is settled for action,'
answered
father Stephen. `In my capacity
as priest I shall to-morrow send to
Leisler
to request permission to go forth at
my pleasure to visit the sick. He will
not deny this I am sure, if I know the
man! Under this pretence I will hold
speech with every Catholic in the town,
and on Saturday night give you the
names of all who will engage in the
conspiracy
!'
`Once get the government back we
shall find no difficulty in presenting
Leisler
in the light of a rebel to the new
king,' said Courtlandt; `for he is bound
to recognize the commissioners of the
crown, and as Leisler has seized his
Province without authority he will come
under censure if not lose his head! He
will find that too much zeal has eaten
him up. You, Robert Logan, are the
only authorised person, as having been
left the government by Nicholson, to hold
it till news came from England, and then
to surrender it to a new Governor.'
`I am ready, gentlemen, to do my part
in this matter.'
`Gentlemen,' said father Stephen, `
before
we break up I would suggest that a
message be at once sent to the king by
Mayor Courtlandt, protesting against
Leisler's usurpation. There is a ship to
sail from Boston next week; and it will
be a wise policy to get the king's ear
first!'
`This by all means,' exclaimed several.
`Once get him prejudiced and Leisler is
a lost man!' cried Livingstone `Father
Stephen, you draw up the address as most
capable.'
`But it occurs to me that if we could
get the co-operation of Colonel Bayard
and his protestant friends,' said the priest,
`that our end would be more effectually
gained. We are all aware that this
gentleman
with the protestants of the English
church are opposed most strongly to this
protestant Dutch dynasty of Leisler's!'
`Yes; I saw Bayard and had an hour's
talk with him this afternoon,' answered
Livingstone. `He is very violent against
Leisler and calls him as stoutly a rebel as
we do!'
`This division in the protestant ranks
will favor us,' said father Stephen. `If
word could be had with Colonel Bayard
and his countenance given to an address
of remonstrance it would have weight
with King William as coming from one
of his own faith.'
`This is a good thought of yours,
father
Stephen,' said Logan. `I will see
Colonel Bayard myself to-night.
Although
we may not get him to join us in
all points, there is little doubt but that he
will be easily prevailed upon to send a
protest to the king against the usurpation
of the Dutch party! Then Leisler's fate
is sealed!'
This plan met with general favor; and
it was decided that Logan should wait
upon him at once. Livingstone proposed
to accompany him, observing that he had
come through the streets and would
return
so disguised as a soldier, having got
the countersign, as Logan had done by
listening.
He then resumed his diguise, which
was as perfect as that which Logan once
more put on, and the two went together
from the house and were let out of the
garden by the priest. The rest of the
conspirators left the garden one by one
by another gate that opened upon the
fields, and, having the pass-word and
being
variously disguised, each found his
way homeward without suspicion.
CHAPTER IX.
THE FISHER'S BOY AND BERTHA.
The
two conspirators, Logan and
Livingstone
,
reached the house of Colonel
Bayard, after a devious course, but
without
being detained by any of the guard
they encountered. The house of this
gentleman, stood near the river, and out
of the denser portion of the town. It was
a tasteful villa, embosomed in trees, and
was one of the most imposing residences
in the Province. They approached the
house through a gravelled avenue, and
ascended a handsome flight of steps to
the door. A light was visible, through
the drawing-room windows, on the left.
Their presence, even before they
knocked
,
was announced, by the deep baying
of a dog, chained within the hall. The
voice of his master was heard within,
silencing
him.
`The Colonel does not mean to be
taken
unawares,' said Livingstone, as the
deep-mouthed notes of the dog, echoed
through the hall.
`Who desires admission?' called out
the Colonel, within.
`Livingstone,' replied this gentleman.
`You are welcome, and I will admit
you in a moment,' was the reply. `Are
you alone?' he added, as he removed a
bar from the inner side of the door.
`Only a friend.'
The door was opened, and when
Colonel
Bayard saw, by the light of the moon,
a soldier and a fisherman standing before
him, ready to enter, he stepped back and
presented a pistol, which he held in his
hand.
`Who are you?' he demanded firmly.
`Livingston, and Robert Logan,'
answered
the former, as he removed his
soldiers'
cap.
`Ah, I recognise you. But this
person
?
Did I hear aright?'
`Is Robert Logan.'
`Escaped? He is well disguised. I
see no likeness, but on your faith, I
admit
him with you. You see I am
something
cautious,' he said, as grasping the
hand of each, he closed the door, and
rebarred
it; but I have no idea of letting
my house become a barrack for Jacob
Leisler's soldiers. There have been two
patroles, already, tramping through
my-grounds
.
This is an indignity, I am in
no humor to put up with. Since I sent
him word, this afternoon, of which, you
doubtless have heard, that I refused to
acknowledge his authority, he has seen
fit to keep spies upon my house. But one
of his minions will enter my doors at his
peril. But, I am detaining you here in
the hall: walk into the drawing room.
I am glad to see you, Mr. Logan. Rumor
had it, you had fled in the Swedish ship.
Does Leisler know you are in the town?'
`No!'
`He would be glad to,' cried Colonel
Bayard, smiling, as they entered an
elegant
parlor, which had partly the air of a
library. `But your disguise would defy
any one. Speak, and let me be sure of
you,' he added, with a lively air.
`I assure you, my dear Colonel, that it
is me, and no other person,' answered
Logan, taking off his fisherman's hat and
coat, and exposing his uniform. My face
you must take on credit, for it looks
darker
than my own.'
`Where have you been?'
`On the islands, where I got this
disguise
.'
`I am glad, on many accounts, that
you have escaped. What do you intend
to do?'
`Try and recover the fort and hold the
government, till authority comes from the
King.'
`Ah, indeed!'
`This is my intention. I have no fear
of opposition from you.'
`No, so long as Leisler's usurpation is
put an end to; though, I confess, I would
rather see the protestant party in power,
than yours again. But you will not hold
it long, so I will second you. But how?'
`We have not exactly decided upon
our plan.' answered Logan, who saw that
it would not be safe, to trust any more of
his plot to the protestant antagonist of
Leisler. `We shall see how things turn,
and be governed by circumstances. Our
object, in calling on you, is to propose
that you, as one of the most prominent
men, of the English protestant party, draw
up an address to King William,
protesting
against Leisler's usurpation, and
declaring
him a rebel. This will have the
effect, if it comes earlier, to the King,
than any ffattering letters Leisler may
transmit, of preventing his
communications
from producing any effect. King
William, will form his opinion from your
letters, and any thing afterwards, from
Leisler, will produce no other effect, than
to confirm him in his opinion, that he is
a rebel.'
While Logan was speaking, Colonel
Bayard smiled, with meaning; and when
the former had ended, the latter took
from a table a written paper, and held it
before him. It was addressed
`
To their most Sacred Majesties
,
William & Mary
,
`You perceive, gentleman,' he said as
they read the address, at the begining,
`that I have anticipated your suggestion.
I was interrupted, by your calling, in the
composition of a solemn remonstrance to
their Majesties, against Leisler's
government
.
I will read to you, what I have
written.'
They listened to the address with deep
attention; and when he had concluded
they both pronounced it satisfactory.
`When that is read by the King,' said
Livingstone, `Leisler's fate is sealed. He
will be put under an arrest by an order
from the crown and sent home to be
tried!'
`How shall you forward this?' asked
Logan.
`By a trusty horseman who is at this
moment making himself ready to start as
soon as I seal and direct it. He goes to
Boston and thence takes the ship to
England
.
He has orders not to stay travel
until he reaches the foot of the throne
and sees the letter in the King's own
hand delivered!'
`Leisler has then placed a rope around
his own neck,' said Livingstone, with
stern bitterness. `We are well pleased
at finding you in this mind! Let no
delay
intervene. If Jacob Leisler suspects
or gets wind of this messenger, he will at
once, having the power, despatch a
vessel
direct to forestall you, and so
represent
the necessity of his taking upon him
the controul of affairs that we and not he
will be proclaimed the rebels!'
`He shall not know it. No man has
had breath of it save you two!'
`And that we may not delay you in
finishing it, nor your messenger from his
saddle, we will take our leave, having
effected
that which brought us hither,' said
Livingstone.
`I will not urge you to stay; but Mr.
Logan, pray by what steps do you hope
to destroy Leisler's power?'
`The most effectual way, sir, is by this
division among the protestants carried
out into open war!'
`How do you mean?'
`I mean that you form at once a strong
party, unite with ours and thus endeavour
to overthrow his!'
`He could not withstand the two
combined
,'
said Livingstone.
`But suppose we combine and overturn
his government, who then, Mr. Logan, you
or I will be elevated to the authority?'
asked Colonel Bayard, with a significant
smile.
`I should not, sir, much as I esteem
you personally, consent that a protestant
should succeed,' answered Logan, firmly,
`It would be exchanging a penny for a
penny!'
`And I, sir,' answered Colonel
Bayard
,
`could not, much as I esteem you
personally, consent to use my influence
to replace a paplst in power. If I
combine
with you and organize an Episcopal
party, it will be that I may overthrow
Leiler; but I cannot consent to help put
a Roman Catholic in his place. We have
had enough of Romanism under Dongan,'
answered Colonel Bayard in a severe
tone.
`I perceive, sir,' responded Logan,
colouring, yet keeping his temper, `that
we have too many points of difference to
amalgamate as a party; but we agree
both in branding Leisler with rebellion!'
`That we agree in!' answered the
protestant
leader, with decision.
`We are then of one mind in a chief
point. There let it rest.'
`There is one thing I would ask of
you, Colonel Bayard?' said Livingstone
in an impressive manner.
`I will hear you, my dear sir.'
`If the Roman Catholics rise in a body
to overthrow Leisler without your
co-operation
,
will you remain passive? If
you assist not us, will you refuse to assist
them?'
`This you may depend upon. But I
also will put a question to you Mr.
Logan
?
If
I
raise a party to overturn
Leisler before you make any such
movement
,
will you remain passive?'
`We will remain passive so far as that
we will not aid Leisler against you; but
I boldly assure you, Colonel,' continued
Logan with a resolute air, `that if you
overthrow Leisler and assume his
authority
,
I shall feel it my duty to
endeavour
by overturning
your
governmant to
re-establish that which he has usurped!'
`We then understand one another,'
answered Colonel Bayard in a fearless,
frank manner.
The two Catholic gentlemen now took
their leave with courtesy, and were let
out of the door by their host, who gave
to each of them his hand as if they were
between the utmost harmony on all points.
`We have gained one thing by this
visit,' said Logan, as they passed down
the avenue; `and this is the knowledge
that Bayard contemplates a revolution;
and that we can't act too speedily. We
have to fear him, quite as much as
Leisler
!'
`The politics of our poor Province,'
said Livingstone, `are in a strange way.
Three parties, and nearly equal in
strength, are about to divide and tear the
land! But it is fortunate for us that the
protestants are at dissension. United,
we should be defeated by them; but
dissevered
as they are we can singly oppose
them. It is well we did not unfold all
our plan to Bayard. He
might
have
betrayed
it, because we are papists,
especially
if he found that he could not get
his party in force to prevent our attack
on Sunday. You were very prudent to
check yourself as you did!'
`I perceived that he had no sympathy
with us, and that the only union that
could be between us would be based
upon
our mutual opposition to Leisler's
government. Here we are now at the
entrance of the main street. Shall you
return to father Stephen's?'
`Yes, and report the result of our
interview
with Bayard! Which way do
you take?'
`I proceed down in the direction of
Maiden Lane.'
`Take care of yourself, my friend, or
Leisler will have you in his hands. You
are aware of the reward he has offered
for you?'
`Yes. I shall not remain in the town.
I have a safe retreat at a fisherman's hut
on Governor's Island. I shall, however,
be present at Father Stephen's on
Saturday
night.'
The two conspirators then parted,
Livingstone
following a path along the skirts
of the town, which brought him, after
five minutes' walk, to the field-gate of
the priest's garden; while Logan took
the side-walk along a narrow lane, which
was subsequently named, after the Prince
of Orange, William street, and after
answering
three challenges by as many sen
tries, reached the front of Jacob Leisler's
house. To his surprise he found the well
occupied by the soldiers of Van Vow's
guard, who were lazily seated about
upon
the benches around it, under the trees,
some of them smoking, others talking,
while one of their number paced up and
down between the well-curb and the
house, acting as sentinel.
Logan advanced with precaution, and
not seeing any thing of Steiny, he began
to entertain some apprehensions as to his
fate. Van Vow was also no where
visible
.
Resolved to ascertain, Logan at
once assumed the tipsy air of a fisherman
who had drank rather too much, and
reeled towards them, singing,
`
I am a fisherman bold and free
,
I sail a king upon the sea
,
The blue wide sea!'
`Who goes dere?' cried the sentry.
`A king!' answered Logan, reeling
and speaking in a drunken tone. `A
king o' the sea!'
`He's a fishermans,' said one of the
men on the well-curb. `He ish trunks.'
`Drunk! I am not drunk; I am as
souber as a judge. Who says I am
drunk?'
`Stand and give te word!' cried the
soldier.
`Who are you? What word?'
`The pass-wort!' responded the
sentry
,
placing his gun at his breast.
`The Prince and the King. Whorray
for King Billy.'
`He ish a true man,, said the sentry,
looking at his comrades for their
affirmation
.
`But he must be take up.'
`Yish, he ish true mansh,' was the
response
.
`But ant you te mansh as lost
you poat?'
`I am the man,' answered Logan,
deliberately
taking a seat upon one of the
benches. `You take me up, eh! I'd
thank you to take me over to my island.'
`The man dat stole your poat,' said
another of the soldiers, taking his pipe out
of his mouth and filling it with fresh
tobacco
,
`was the Papist secretary.'
`Logan, you mean.'
`Yish; they say he gone away in her.
He is hid down by te islands.'
`No; he went in the ship you may be
sure. But what are you doing here.'
`Keepin' guart, as you sees.'
`On what?'
`On te Governor's house.'
`Where is your captain?'
`He ish in te house. Don't you know
he ish Mynheer Van Vow, te
burgomeister
,
ash ish goin' to marry de dochter ov
Jacops Leisler?'
`What can a poor fishermans know?'
said one of the men.
`And tipsy at that,' rejoined another
with a laugh.
`I'm not so drunk as I did not know
Mynheer Van Vow is engaged to the new
Governor's daughter,' answered Logan.
`So he is in there.
`Yish; where should he pe put in
dere?' answered the soldier, taking a
long satisfactory whiff from his pipe.
`I'll sit here and smoke with you if
one of you will lend me a pipe,' said
Logan
,
placing his hand familiarly on the
shoulder of his nearest neighbor.
A pipe was very cordially given, and
having lighted it, the disguised secretary
proceeded to smoke and chat away with
the soldiers, artfully drawing from them
all they knew touching affairs in the fort,
as well as the engagement between the
little burgomaster and the beautiful
Bertha
.
From them he learned, also, that
no fisher-lad had been seen by them,
from which he suspected that Steiny was
still in the house, and perhaps unable to
escape. He, therefore, had made up his
mind to go and kock at the door and ask
for him, when the door opened and Van
Vow made his appearance in great
bodily
perturbation.
But, before recounting the events that
followed his appearance, we will follow
Steiny into the house on his mission.
After he had got into the entry, he was
met by Bertha, who, with a light in her
hand, looked at his face closely, and then
told him to follow her. She led him to
a small back sitting room, where, having
set the light down and closed the door,
she said,
`Now, good fisher-lad, tell me
speedily
what this is you have for my private
ear.'
Steeiny, instead of immediately
replying
,
stood gazing with admiration and
wonder upon her extremely beautiful
face. He had never seen any thing, as
he subsequenty declared, half so
handsome
.
Before he could recover his
tongue to reply, a knock was heard at
the street door.
`There is another,' she said
impatiently
,
as if she did not care to be
interrupted
.
`Brecket,' she said, going to the
room door, `go to the upper window and
look down and tell me who it is that calls:
Now, my boy, thy errand quickly.'
`Well, ma'am,' said Steiny, `I'm
blowed if your eyes don't make me all of
a quirl. They shine jist like two drops o'
water sparkling in shells!'
`Was that what you had to tell me, you
freckled little rogue, hey?' said Bertha
laughing.
`No, that's my own errand; but what
I have to tell you, comes from another
guess sort o' person than Steiney Sneek.'
`Who can it be? Who sent you?'
`Ma'am!' cried Brecket, appearing at
the door.
`Well.'
`It is the burgomaster.'
`The plague! What says he?'
`He wants to come in, and smoke his
pipe with you,' said Brecket, delivering
also, the whole of Van Vow's message;
to which, Bertha, with an annoyed air,
sent the reply, already recorded, as
delivered
by Brecket from the window, to
the philosophical Van Vow.
`Now, my boy, who sent thee?'
inquired
Bertha, closing the door; `sit down and
tell me.'
`I'm afraid you wont like to hear.'
`Then you should not have thought of
giving me a message, improper for me to
listen to,' she said, reproachingly, and
with a maiden's reserve.
`It aint cozactly improper, ma'am, but
it might'nt please you.'
`Why not. Tell me who it is from?'
she asked with a considerable degree of
curiosity, yet, not with too much
eagerness
.
`To tell you who it is, is the who,'
responded
Steiney, very intelligibly.
`How oddly you talk. I shall send
you away, and let whoever gave you a
message to me, find some other person to
deliver it; for I see I can get nothing
from you.'
`Well, I'll tell you, if you'll promise
not to be angry.'
`I promise you!' responded Bertha,
still, wholly at a loss to guess who had
sent him, though it would be doing
Logan
injustice, to say, that he did not once
enter into her mind, as she ran over in her
thoughts, the probabilities of who might
be the person.
`You know feyther had his boat stole.'
`Yes, and you have been paid for it,
three marks and a half.'
`Do you know who stole the boat?'
`How should I?'
`Well,
I
know,' answered Steiney,
significantly
.
`Then, why do you not secure the
thief?'
`I've got him.'
`You have?' she exclaimed with
surprise
.
`Yes.'
`Then, where is your boat?'
`I've got that, to.'
`And your three marks and a half!
You are a young rogue, sirrah.'
`Dont call me names, ma'am. Here's
your money agen, if that's all makes you
talk.'
`I don't want it. What have you said
you wished to see me for? You are
trifling
with me.'
`No, I ain't. I like you too well for
that. You see I come here, to tell you I
got the thief.'
`And why do you thing it necessary to
tell me?'
`Because, I guess as how you'd like to
know.'
`How troublesome you act. If you
have anything to say, out with it.'
`Well, you see father's skiff was down
by the ditch, at the back o' the fort, this
mornin', where he left it, and when he
went after it, to go home, for we lives
down on Governor's island, he found it
gone. He hunted heaven and earth for
it, and then took to swearin' and gets
drunk. Well, he did'nt find it in tipsy
town, and so when he gets sober agen,
which he did, arter two hours' nap; he
goes to the new Governor, your dad, I
guess he be. He tells the Governor,
and'
`But what has this to do with message
you had to me?'
`Well, a good deal, because the
message
is from the thief.'
`From the thief!'
`Yes. You see, we cocht him down at
the island with the boat, coz he did'nt
know he was comin with it, right where
it belonged. So we grabbed him, and
when feyther got home in a neighbor's
boat, we built a gallows, as high as a
ship's mast, to hang him on.'
`Hang him for stealing a boat,' she
cried, with a shudder.
`Sartain ma'am.'
`But it would be murder, without the
law. Are you fishermen heathens?'
`Not quite, ma'am. But he stole the
boat without law, and we mean to hang
him without law. That's what we calls
even: and then he deserves to be hanged
besides, cause he is a papist.'
`That is bad, but still, you have no
right to hang him. I am glad you let me
know this. I will at once see my father,
and he will take the matter in hand.'
`And he will hang him, sure.'
`If he does, it will be by the law.'
`Wall, I reckon yon would'nt like to
have him hung, law or no law, if you
guessed who it was.'
`Do I know?'
`You've seen him, and he's seen you.
He is the man that sent me to you, to see
if you would try and save his neck.'
`Who is it? If the poor wretch were
a total stranger to me, I would try to
save him. But, he says he has seen me.
Is he one of the towns folk?'
`Yes.'
`Hang him for stealing a canoe!'
`Yes, he'll be hanged, unless you can
do something for him. He asked us to
spare his life, till he could send word to
you; and gave us fifty dollars to do it,
that's why I come to know what you
would do for him.'
`A man who could pay fifty dollars,
steal a canoe. This is strange! What
is his name? I will save him if I can.
It is horrible to hang a man so
barbarously
,
were he the veriest wretch on earth.
What name has he?'
`Robert Logan,' answered Steiney, in
a quiet tone, closely watching the effect
of the name upon her countenance.
CHAPTER X.
THE FAIR BORROWER.
At
the name uttered by Steiney, the
maiden started with looks of deep
surprise
and alarm. The color fled from
her cheeks and her lips parted with a
tremulous effort to speak. Steiny, albeit,
not skilled in the emotions of the female
heart, was not so inexperienced as not to
discover that Robert Logan was far from
being an indifferent person to her.
`Do you mean to say,' she said in a
low impressive, earnest tone, as if she
trusted she should not find her fears
confirmed
by his answer, `do you mean to
say that this person is the Secretary of
the late Governor; or it is only some
individual
bearing the same name?'
`It is Logan the Secretary, ma'm,'
answered Steiney, firmly.
`Do you charge him with stealing your
boat?' she asked, pale and anxious; for
she had not yet heard the rumor that
Logan
had been seen rowing away in a
fisher's skiff, her belief having been that
he had got away in the ship.
`Yah. I'll tell you how it was. He
was driven hard, you sees, and findin'
feyther's scow on the shore he jumps in
it and pulls out o' the way while every
body was busy on the other side o' the
fort!'
`But that was not stealing! He fled
to save his life!' she said with an
imploring
air, looking in the youth's face.
`I don't know what you call it. I
found him down by the island with the
boat. So when he told us who he was'
`Then he told you his name?'
`Yah; and when we know'd it was the
papist we resolved to hang him.'
`Then you would have hanged him for
being a Roman, not for stealing?'
`We would ha' hanged him for both!'
`How dreadful! Where is he? Did
he send you to me?'
`Well, he's safe. He han't hung yet.
He said if I would come and tell you
about him he'd give me fifty dollars, and
he believed you could interfere to save
him. It would be a pity to hang him,
for he seems a proper nice chappy!'
`How dreadful! What fearful times
are these when men and boys even think
so lightly of hanging a fellow-being,'
cried Bertha, clasping her hands in
anguish
.
`What said he?'
`He wanted me to tell you that he had
fallen into the hands of some fishermen.
who have resolved to hang him
to-morrow
morning by nine o'clock, unless you
send to them one thousand dollars!'
`Money?' she cried with looks of
delight
.
`Oh, tell me will money buy his
life?'
`One thousand dollars will, ma'm!'
`You shall have it.'
`When?'
`Within an hour. I will get it and
save him. I am rejoiced. What a load
is lifted from my heart! for I knew not,'
she said to herself, `how I should plead
to my father for the life of a man for
whom he himself has offered a reward!'
`Yes,' said Steiny who heard her last
words; `I hear the Governor has offered
a pretty sum for him! But if you'll give
the thousand you shall have him! If you
dont, he swings!'
`You shall certainly have it,' she
answered
,
`Money for life, oh yes!' But
hardly had she spoken these words when
her countenance fell. `
How
shall I get
this large sum? My father is rich, but
what can I say to him if I ask him for it.
No, he must not know the use I have for
it. I can make him no answer! Alas! I
am in as great a strait as before! Ah, I
see. I have the way to obtain it,' she
said with joyful animation. `Lad, you
shall have the money. But what surety
have I that his life shall be spared?'
`I want first to see the cash; but afore
I takes the money out o' the house I'll
bring him into it where you can see him.
I'll leave him with you and then lug off
the silver!'
`Bring him here?' she cried with a
start and blush of surprise.
`Yah. He wouldn't be safe no where
else in the town. Besides, I know he'd
like to see you and thank you. He speaks
of you so handsome!'
`Did he?'
`If ever a gentleman loved a lady that
ere man love you, ma'm!'
`I have scarcely seen him.'
`But he has seen you. He told me
all about it, when I said I didn't believe
he'd ever spoke to you and he was sendin'
me to you on a flim-flam cruise!'
`What did he say that
I
loved him?'
she asked, blushing.
`He said he was afraid you didn't;
but that didn't make any difference, he
should love you till he died. And now
I remember he said he shouldn't so much
mind being hanged, only he didn't like to
leave you. He said if you was dead he'd
be obliged to us to hang him, as where
you was was his world! That's the way
he talked, ma'm, when we was about to
string him up!'
`Thank Heaven that he thought of me
at that moment if it has saved him from
such a dreadful death!'
`Yes, you saved his life, no doubt,
ma'm; and I guess he'll love you a
hundred
times more for it, for if it had'nt
been that he loved you and spoke about
you, he'd 'a been in kingdom-come
before
now!'
`Poor young gentleman! And did he
say he loved me?' she asked, not
disguising
her feelings from the boy as if he had
been older, in which case she would have
been more reserved. But the boy,
unknown
to her, had the keen observing
eye and acute perception of a man. `Did
he speak thus kindly of me?'
`Yah, more than I can say, for I can't
put it into the fine language he spoke, coz
I'm no scholard. But he'd go his death
for you, ma'm, and
no
mistake!'
Rude as this expression was, Bertha's
ear caught only the spirit of it, and her
heart thrilled at the sweet thought that
she was loved, and loved by one whose
image had many and many a night
mingled
in her dreams. She never dreamt
about the burgomaster.
`Oh joy, joy!' said she in the depth of
her heart; `he loves me whom I love!'
`Well, ma'm, you say you'll give the
thousand?' interrupted Steiny, bluntly.
`If you can't get it he swings you know.'
She started. She seemed all at once
to be recalled to the realities and
difficulties
involving her. `
The money;
without
it he dies
!' were echoed from the
depths of her being. She stood irresolute
and thoughtful. She seemed to be
revolving
some painful subject in her mind.
Something that called the quick color of
conscious wrong-doing to her cheek;
something from which her frank and
generous
nature seemed to shrink.
`
Without the money he dies!
' seemed
to swell into a voice of thunder in her
heart.
`It must be done!' she cried quickly
and earnestly; `the circumstances will
excuse it. There is no alternativeno
escape!'
`No, ma'm there is no escape,'
answered
Steiny, catching at the word.
`Young man,' she cried firmly, `you
shall have the money; wait here!'
`I wonder now,' said he, in a tone of
affected indifference, `if for any other
chappy as was to be hung we people down
on the island could get a thousand
dollars
to save him.'
`Any other!' she repeated; `I cannot
speak of any other. I should not be
called
upon, I hope, to judge in any other
case. In this one I am ready to act and
do all I can.'
`So I see. I was only thinkin if any
poor devil who was to be hanged could
be bought off the gallows by callin on
you, I'd let em offer to let em hang me
and then pocket the thousand. But I
rayther think I'd suffer some afore you'd
give a hundred for me.'
Bertha smiled, but with a look of
anxiety
,
for her thoughts were busy.
`If I give this money to you for
Robert
Logan's life, will the world know
it?' she said, laying her hand upon his
shoulder and looking closely into his
eyes.
`No ma'm; it'll be kept secret; for it
would come as hard on us when a new
Governor comes, if we let it out, as on
you for buying a papist!'
`A papist!' she repeated within
herself
,
as if the words struck her ear with
a new and strange meaning. `True he
is a papist. I have never thought of
that
.
But he must be saved, though he be no
more to me nor I to him than we are
now. There is more need that he be
saved and not die in his errors. Poor
noble young gentleman. Oh, that I
knew how to act! That I could confide
in my father! But I can make nothing
known to him. What do I contemplate
doing! I, his own daughter, am seeking
to save a papista man whom he seeks
to destroy! If I am detected I am a
traitress! Nay I am even now a
traitress
to him and to the new king. Yet
this young man must not die! Oh, no!
I will save him! How little did I know
my own heart till his danger comes and
presses upon it. And he loves me too!
How my heart fills with joy as a fountain
overrunning!'
`I'm waitin for you to get the money,'
said Steiny, who, the false, lying rogue,
had by this time got sufficient proof of
the love of the new Governor's daughter
for the young secretary, but who wished
at the same time shrewdly and
cunningly
to carry out a private matter for his
own especial and individual interest.
`You shall have it,' she replied with
decision. `Will you await me here?'
`How long?'
`Some ten, twenty minutesI cannot
say how long. There is a book to amuse
you while I am absent from the room.'
As she spoke she took down from a
shelf a large thick folio and laid it before
him on the table, opening it at the same
time to show him that it contained plates.
It was a volume of the Book of Martyrs,
and the picture to which she opened
being a graphic representation of certain
grim inquisitors boiling a victim in a
cauldron of oil, drew Steiny's attention
at once, and he manifested his
astonishment
by a low prolonged whistle at a
spectacle that quite surpassed any thing
in his juvenile experience. Steiny could
not read, but pictures are their own
interpreters
,
as the young gentleman's
exclamation
sufficiently attested:
`Injuns makin a chowder out o' a
white man, if they ant I'm a whale!'
He was soon so deeply interested in
the mysteries of a book that will
perpetuate
to all time the deepest crimes that
have ever disgraced humanity, that he
quite forgot where he was, and gave vent
in an original and indistinct phraseology
to his emotions as scene after scene rose
to his view, in a way that would have
called
both frowns and smiles on the face of
Father Stephen had he been an unseen
looker on.
As soon as Bertha had placed the book
before him she left the room, and taking
a candle from the table in the hall she
opened a door on the opposite side which
took her into a large and handsome
parlor
,
furnished in the old Dutch style,
The history of the life of Christ was
pictured
in blue on square tiles, set in around
the fire-place; a cuckoo clock stood
above the mantel that, just as she
entered
struck nine, when out flew a cuckoo,
who flapped his wings and sung his song;
but which, ere well finished, was
interupted
by a trooper who, mounted on
horseback
,
charged the bird sword in hand,
and drove it at a little door, which
obligingly
flew open to shelter it, whereupon
the trooper, after brandishing his sword,
fiercely wheeled his charger, retreated,
and disappeared as he came, by an
opposite
door, that opened to receive and shut
him in.
About the room hung portraits of the
three preceding generations of the
Leislers
,
one of them, who was painted in
armor
,
showed by the bars of his visor that
he was a baron. In truth, the lineage of
the fair Bertha was a noble one.
Having entered the room, she closed
the door, placed the candle upon a
dark-colored
,
polished stand, supported by
three lion's feet, and then gave herself
up to several minutes' deep reflection
At length she spoke out with
emphasis
in the following manner:
`It must be done. I will listen no
longer to any whispers of conscience.
A life depends on ita life worth a
thousand lives like
his
. It is right to
deceive
himit is right to use him. Has
he not annoyed me long, and I have had
patience with? I will test his love now;
but it shall only be a loan: he shall be
repaid. Robert Logan is rich and will
repay it, though now he cannot, it would
seem, command the sum. What
confidence
he has shown in me by sending to
me. Alas! that he should be a Papist!
This saddens my thoughts; yet, though
I may never see him, save when he shall
come hither, he shall be saved! Oh,
how shall I rejoice to know, to feel that
he owes his life to me! Am I to see him?
Ought I to see him? How else shall I
know this lad has given the money over
to the fishermen who hold him in custody,
thirsting for his blood.'
Poor Bertha! she was deceived in
all this we know. Her fears were
groundless; yet her love was not the less
sincere for being awakened and called
forth by forged evils to him she loved.
`I will see him here, if I obtain the
money, before I give it up, that I may
know he is safe. I would shrink from
seeing him; but I wish to speak with him
and urge him to give up his erroneous
faith, considering how near he has been
to death. From me, to whom he will
owe his safety, he may take a few words
kindly. Perhaps they may do him good
and save his soul (Oh, that he was not a
Papist!) I will then advise him to leave
the province till the danger is past. Each
moment that he lingers here I shall
tremble
for him.'
Perhaps Bertha, if she had very
closely
questioned herself, could not have
given a satisfactory reason why it was at
all necessary that she should see the
young secretary. But in her heart there
was an earnest, an ardent desire to see
and speak with him after he should
escape
,
if only one word. But it is not
delicate to analyze too closely a young
maiden's heart.
A second time she said emphatically,
as if she had come to a decision which
could not be moved,
`It shall be done; there is no
alternalive
.
The burgomaster's vanity shall
administer to my present need. If it be
wrong to deceive him, it is a greater
wrong that Robert Logan should die by
the hands of these fierce men who have
him in their power.'
Thus speaking, she softly raised the
window next to the stoope, and
noiselessly
pushed open the shutters. She
carefully glanced out into tue moon-lit
street. There stood in the middle of it
the burgomaster's guards, each man with
a pipe in his mouth, silently smoking and
in line. She opened the shutter still
farther, so she could command a view of
the stoope.
There, upon one of its benches, she
discovered the portly figure of Mynheer
Van Vow, her warlike lover. He was
reclining with one arm hanging over the
balustrade, his head resting against the
door-post, his eyes closed, and his pipe
out. He was plainly fast asleep, good,
easy man, thus to take so gently love's
reverses. By him stood his great sword,
resting against his breast, where it rose
and fell with every pulsation of his deep
and sonorous breathing.
`There sleeps he, that lump of vanity
and good-natured simplicity,' said she.
`I am sorry I have to deceive thee,
worthy
bbrgomaster; for, though I love thee
not, I am not thy enemy. But it is to
save a life, and by and by thou shalt have
thy gold again. But he loves his money.
He may become alarmed at my demand.
Courage! I will rouse him up!'
Thereupon she whispered softly; but
his ears did not hear the voice which
would have started Logan from the
profoundest
repose.
`Mynheer Van Vow,' she repeated in
a little under tone.
The burgomaster replied by a
sonorous
snore. The maiden laughed, and
took from the inside of the room Jacob
Leisler's Sunday walking-stick, and with
it she punched her lover thrice, each
time harder than the preceding.
Suddenly
he started up, as if conscious of
being disturbed. His huge sword fell to
the floor of the stoope with an enormous
clanging sound, while his pipe dropping
to the ground, was smashed into pieces.
The noise made by the falling weapon
and by the pipe, with the sensation of
certain punches in the ribs, combined
with a warlike dream of towns taken and
sacked, through which the brain of the
burgomaster was battling, made him
believe
that he was in the midst of a real
battle.'
`Ho! to arms! Death, murders and
fires! Help! Deal blows, and don't be
afraid of the papists. Down with the pope
and protect Bertha.'
The sound of his voice, his words, and
his confusion, startled his soldiers. They
rushed forward, with their match-locks
presented; when, seeing no one but the
burgomaster, who was brandishing his
sword terribly, the corporal, a man of
sense and nerve, saw into the matter at
once,
`Mynheer, you have been dreaming.
There is no battle.'
`Ant they?' answered Van Vow,
dropping
the point of his sword. `I thought
I vas taking von towns at least.'
`It was a dream, burgomaster, for a
minute ago you was asleep: then I saw
you up, dealing blows about, and
shouting
.'
`Bless my souls and podies, so it vas a
dreams. But vas'nt I prave in te dreams
though? Did'nt I show valors and
fightins
.'
`You did bravely,' answered the
corporal
.
`It vas goot for te enemies it vas a
dreams,' said the burgomaster, with a vain
air.
Bertha had instantly closed the
shutter
,
and no one discovered the cause of
the burgomaster's alarm. It was now
very natural that she should go to the
door to learn the cause, for she wished
to get speech of him. So she opened it
a little, and said,
`Mynheer Van Vow, what has
happened
?'
`Happened, lights o' my eyes! dont
venture out till all is safes.'
`What is the danger?'
`Dangers! Battles and vars! Vel it is
you had such brave soldiers and varriors
as Slems Van Vow, to keep garts here.
Why the papists have been here, ten
thousand ov em if dere vas no mans ov
em, and dey would haf carried you off,
pody and soul. But I defended you wit
my lifes, and dere is not one on em to pe
seen, showin his face on te face ov te
earth.'
`I am greatly indebted to you,'
answered
Bertha.
`It was only a dream, Miss Bertha,'
cried the corporal; `so dont have fears of
any thing.'
`Out ov te vay,' cried the burgomaster
angrily; `he vas asleep, and knows
notting
,
dear eyes.'
`Well, I am thankful for my escape.
Come in Slems, that I may thank you in
better words than standing here.'
`You goes apout your pizzinesses,
corporals
Veckings,' said Slems; `see tat
you keeps better vatch. Come in, fair
dat ish to pe.'
With this gallant speech, the
burgomaster
entered the house. Bertha closed
the door, and led him into the parlor.
She was afraid that the boy, Steiney,
would have been alarmed by the uproar,
and she should have met him in the hall;
but he was too deeply interested in the
study of the history of Moses tiled on the
fire-jam, to heed any noise; for, having
got through with the Martyrs, he gave
the same undivided attention to the
latter
,
which he had bestowed upon the
former
;
pictures, being a treat of rare
occurrence
to the young fisher's boy.
Bertha having got Slems into the
parlor
,
and shut the door, taken his hat, and
laid it aside, and treated him with such
smiling hospitality that, taking it
altogether
,
in her full belief in his having
risked his life, fighting for her, against
an attack of the papists, as he had told
her, he half repented himself, of his
fibbing
;
for Slems had a conscience. But
she gave him no time to act from its
dictates
,
and dishonor himself, by
confessing
the truth.
`My dear good Slems,' said Bertha,
seating herself by his side, and looking
up into his face in the most bewitching
way.
`What, sweet Bertha,' answered the
burgomaster, feeling his brain swim and
reel under her bright glances, as if
champaigne
were in it. `Bless me, what a
happy thing it is, to thinks you and I are
to pe married, hey?' and the barbarian
tapped her under the pretty chin, with
two of his fat fingers.
`This, doubtless, you often think
upon
,'
she said, in the most delicious tones
in the world; and she smiled with the
most bewildering witchery. Slems would
not have been mortal to have withstood
her.
`I never smoke mine bipe, but I sees
you dancing in te blue wreathes, Bertha,
love o' my heart, dears,' he said, with
emotion.
`How happy I ought to be! Do you
know, dear Slems, that I think you a
very brave man.'
`Does you, indeed. A brave mans.
That is what makes me knows you loves
me, Berthas. But no! I'll pe honest.
I'm a cow'
`Don't say one syllable more,' she
exclaimed
,
pressing her pretty hand over
his mouth. `How many days is it, before
we are to be married?'
`Thirteen, the day after to-morrows.'
`Why don't you say fifteen from
to-day
?'
`Coz I wishes, pretty Berthas, to make
it short as possible.'
`Well, I believe you love me, Slems,
but I want proof of it.'
`Take mine lifes. Here is mine big
swort.'
`No: I will take what I know you
value
as much.'
`Vat it ish?'
`Money!'
`Moneies?'
`Yes. I need a thousand silver
dollars
,
for some purpose, no matter what;
if it is only to test your love for me.
Now, Slems Van Vow,' she added,
assuming
a gay air, while her heart
throbbed
heavily, `if you truly love me, you
will not refuse to let me have this little
sum;' she said, fixing her eyes earnestly
upon his face, as if she would read in its
fleshy rotundity, his very soul.
CHAPTER XI.
THE NEGOTIATION.
The
burgomaster gazed upon the
beautiful little Dutch maiden with his
eyes expanded to their fullest periphery.
It is not certain whether he was the most
amazed at her demand or at her
denominating
a thousand dollars a `little' sum.
`Well, Slems, have you heard me?
she said impatiently. `Shall I repeat my
words?'
`Bless my souls and podies, Berthas!'
`Well, what is the matter?'
`You dont pe earnests?'
`I never was more so!' she said very
positively.
`One tousants tollars!'
`Slems Van Vow,' cried Bertha,
repeating
the burgomaster's name with
emphasis
.
`Vat, Berthas!'
`You have professed to love me. You
are worth twenty thousand dollars. I ask
you to give proof of your love to lend me
one thousand until the day we are
married
.'
`One tousant tollars ish great deal
monish.'
`What do you think I am worth?
Will you give me up and let me marry
another for half you are worth?'
`No, tunder and blixens! Who will
you marries?' cried the burgomaster,
alarmed as if the imagined husband of
Bertha stood before him.
`Well, now you expect to get me,
whom you profess to value so highly,
while you look as if you were going to
be robbed when I, to test your love, ask
you to let me have such a trifle as a
thousand
dollars.'
`Is it only to test my loves, Berthas?'
said the burgomaster, who had really
begen
to be alarmed; for next to Bertha
Leisler, he loved his money.
`I will not indulge you by replying to
this suspicious question. If you cant trust
me I will try some one else. I dare say
I could find some handsome young
gentleman
in the town who would gladly let
me have a great deal more than that, if
I would consent to marry him!'
`You cant marry any podies but me,'
answered the burgomaster very positively.
`I shall not ask you, Mynheer Van
Vow,' she said pouting with partly real
anger and partly affected pique. `So good
evening, sir. I will leave you to your
pipe, which I know very well you love
more than you do me!'
And thus speaking she rose to go.
Slems looked after her as she slowly
went towards the door. Love for Bertha
got the mastery over love of money.
`You ant goings, Berthas!' he said
deprecatingly.
`Indeed I am. If you cant let me have
this little sum you cant love me.'
`I does love you, Berthas! You shall
have it; but,' he added cautiously as she
returned to him smiling, `but you only
means to tries me, heh? I sees it ish!
So you shall have it, Berthas. But you
will lock it ups in a box ant gives me te
keys till we gets married!'
`I shant promise any such thing. If
you cant trust me, I can't trust you? So,
if you ever expect to find favor in my
eyes, Mynheer Van Vow, you will act
like a true lover and give me the money.'
`Bless my souls! Must you have it
to-morrows?'
`To-night;' she answered very firmly.
`To-nichts!' he repeated with simple
amazement. `What can you wants wit
monieshso mush miesh to-nicht?'
`If you let me have the money you
must ask no questions. You must just
trust me. I want the money this very
hour!'
`I hant got so much moniesh apout
me!'
`You have twice as much in your iron
box at home. Don't you remember one
day you counted it out to show me how
rich you were? Now not a word more.
Go at once and get the money and bring
it to me in gold!'
`Vell, I must do it, I sposhe,' he
sighed
.
`But you'll give it pack agen vhen
you knows I love you; vor if I didn't
loves you, dear Berthas, I wouldn't let
you have so mush moniesh!'
`If you get it at once and bring it to
me I shall know you love me and never
doubt you again!'
`Den I gets it richt away vor you;
pecause
you only vishes to try me, and vhen
you gets it you keeps it a little ant gif it
pack to me agens!'
With these words the burgomaster
rose to his feet. Bertha shook his hand
and called him `good Slems,' and his
face shone with joy, as he looked upon
her and thought how happy he was at the
idea of having such a sweet pretty maiden
become
vrow
Van Vow.
`Now dont stay, Slems. Be just as
quick as you can,' she said, going out of
the door and pushing him as he went to
hurry him. `I shall expect you back in
twenty minutes, as it is only a few steps
to your house!'
`Will you kiss me, Berthas, when I
come back?' he said, stopping full.
`Let me see you back first. Hasten!'
`Pless me, vat a hurrys you pe in. Vat
te tyfil can you vant me to go avter it
to-nicht
!'
`Don't swear, Slems, its wicked!' she
said as she opened the street door to let
him out.
`But '
She would not let him speak, but
fairly
shoved him out upon the stoope and
closed the door after him.
`Tousant tollars!' he ejaculated as he
recovered his equilibrium. `She ish vera
extravagants!'
The burgomaster then called upon
two of his soldiers to act as a body-guard
and marched off on his reluctant errand
in the direction of his own abode, where
he dwelt with his mother, a little
hunchbacked
Dutch dame, who thought there
was no person equal to her son upon the
earth's round ball. But mother's heroes
are always the world's fools.
`Now my heart is relieved,' cried
Bertha
,
clapping her hands as she closed the
door upon the burgomaster. `Now he
will be saved. In less than three hours'
time he will be out of the power of those
horrid fishermen, and,
perhaps
, I may see
him here. But I dare not think about it.
It is wrong, I fear, to think about it. He
is a Papist, too. But I will never marry
this simple burgomasternever, never!
Have I done wickedly in deceiving him?
But what else could I do! I could not
tell him what I needed the money for!
But he shall have it back again! It seems
a pity to take advantage of the poor man's
love for me to do a favor to one whom I
truly love, and who
loves
me! But there
is a life at risk, and all other
considerations
must yield to the emergency. By
and by, when the young secretary is safe,
I will confess all to Slems and ask his
pardon,
perhaps
. But I fear my
fisher-boy
has got tired looking at the martyrs
all this time.'
She opened the door of the little back
parlor, where she had left Steiny busy
examining the pictures in the Book of
Martyrs. She entered softly to see what
he was doing, and, to her surprise and
alarm, saw him very busily engaged in
fishing with a pin hook for four or five
jet gold fish in a glass globe.
`Why, what are you doing?' she
exclaimed
,
running up to rescue her
favorites
,
`and what is this you've got? My
net purse, as I'm alive. You've killed
my fish.'
`What be I doin'? I'm catchin' these
here shiners,' he answered very coolly,
drawing out her last fish as she spoke, by
means of her purse, of which he had
made a dip-net, by fastening it to the end
of a fork.
All the fish lay panting upon the table.
She gazed upon them with horror and
grief.
`What have you done?'
`Cocht every one on 'em clean. I
tried the hook first, you see, and then
made this here dip-net, which works first
rate. What pretty fish they be. I never
seed none o' 'em like 'em down the
bay.'
`I wish you'd been down the bay,'
cried Bertha quickly, taking them up,
one by one, and putting them back in
the globe. One of them turned over on
his back and lay quiet. The other three,
after performing sundry eccentric man
uvres, seemed to dart about again quite
as lively as ever.
`How could you be so cruel? One of
them is dead. You are very bad.'
`Well, I didn't know as I was doin'
any harm. Fish is made to be cocht all
the world over. I seed 'em here, and
bein tired lookin at blue pictures and
black priests stickin men on forks and
harpoons, and I thought I'd catch them
here fish, so as not to be idle.'
`I'm so sorry.'
`Be you? Well, then, I'm dd if I
ant.'
`Why, what a boy.'
`What have I done now?' he asked
with amazement.
`You swore.'
`Swore! What is swore?'
`What a strange creature!' she said,
laughing.
`Have you got the silver?'
`It'll be here soon.'
`I'm plaguy glad, coz, you see, I'm
tired waitin'. I'll bring you up a
tom-cod
to-morrow for killin' that are fish as
is showin his belly white.'
`No matter. I'll forgive you, as you
didn't know any better.'
In the meanwhile Slems tramped
along to his house which was a one-story
mansion, with a roof twice as high and
almost as steep as the walls. It
projected
over the door eight feet, supported by
columns, leaving a piazza in front. He
left his guard at the door, and entered,
sighing as he went. He found a light in
the room where his mother was, and
without replying to any of her questions
of alarm, walked straight to his own
bedroom
.
He rolled the bed out from the
wall and exposed a small door, which he
unlocked. Within was a large
iron-bound
chest, which was securely
fastened
by padlocks. He stooped down to it,
and, with many a sigh, opened the chest.
It took him a quarter of an hour to count
out the gold, which he at length effected,
relocked the chest, and restored things
as they were before. The gold he placed
in a leather bag, and carried it out in his
hand, though evidently feeling it to be
a great weight. It weighed down not
only his hand, but his heart. It was the
saddest deed ever performed by the
burgomaster
in his peaceful life. Love and
avarice had struggled from the outset,
and more than once the latter came near
getting the victory. But Slems recalled
the bright eyes and sweet voice of
Bertha
,
and love again kicked the beam.
At length he reached the house and
was admitted. Bertha, when she saw the
bag in his hand, was all smiles; for she
was really overjoyed. She led him into
the parlor, and offered to take the bag
from him, as he seemed to be sweating
under its weight. But he held firmly on
to it.
`No, no, Berthas! You seees I hef
it. Now, doesn't I loves you?'
`You do indeed, Slems.'
`Ten 'tis enough. I've pring te
money, and tat show you dat I loves you.
No dere ish no need tat you haf it.'
`Yes, I must have it! I never shall
believe you love me, unless you are
willing
to leave it with me, and not to think
of it, nor ask for it, nor say a word about
it to any body for seven days.'
`Vell, I 'spose I must den lets you
haf it,' he said, laying it down upon a
chair. She immediately took it up,
saying
,
`Thanks, thanks, good Slems,' and
hastened with it from the room.
He half rose to call after her, for as he
saw it going away his avarice began to
take the alarm; but all at once, as if
struck with a sense of shame at his want
of confidence in her, he sat down again.
As he did so she shut to the door, as he
heard her turn the key he exclaimed,
with misgivings
`Pless my podies!'
The next moment Bertha was in the
little back parlor.
`Here, Steiny, is the money. There
is one thousand dollars. Hasten with it,'
she said, placing the bag in his hand,
which he found so heavy that he
instantly
let it drop. He, however, raised it
again and grappled it with both hands.
`How long will it take you to reach the
island?'
`Not more than half an hour!'
`Then go at once. Free him from the
power of his captors, and send him hither
to-night, that I may know he is freed, for
I shall not rest till I have assurance of it.
You need not leave the money, as you
proposed, for I believe you are honest
and will trust you; besides, unless the
men you say hold him see the gold, they
will not let him come. So take it with
you, and do not deceive me, for you see
I put perfect confidence in you. As you
deceive me so you will have to answer it
at the bar of heaven!'
`I al'ays keeps clear o' bars, especially
at high water, so dont fear me.'
`How ignorant the boy is. Come with
me. I will show you a way out that will
prevent any one from seeing you. When
you come back with Mr. Logan to let me
know he is safe, for that is all I wish to
see him for, you bring him by the same
way.'
She then led him out by the rear of
the house through a small garden, and
let him out into a lane that run along
between
garden fences quite to the water
side. Here she parted with him,
cautioning
him to let her learn within two
hours of the safety of the prisoner. This
Steiny swore she should do, and then
marched off with Slem's `tousan tollar,'
his heart as light at his two-fold success,
both for Logan's interests and
his own
, as
Slem's had been heavy when he was
lugging
it from his own house to Bertha's.
As soon as Bertha got back into the
house, which she re-entered with a
bounding
and happy heart, she hastened to her
prisoner, Slems.
`Vhere ish te monish?' he called out.
the moment she unlocked the door and
made her appearance.
`It is safe, dear Slems! you dont know
how much I am flattered to think you
have put such confidence in me and
shown you love me!'
`Yesh, I half show it one tousan
tollar
!
Vere ish te bags?'
`Dont concern yourself about it at all.'
`I hopes it ish safes!'
`Dont fear. But you know you were
not to think or speak of it under seven
days!'
`Vell I vont.'
`That's a good Slems.'
`Now vhere ish te kiss?' he said,
holding
his round shining cheek towards her.
`Did I promise?'
`Yesh, you promises;' and the cheek
was still presented like a target to an
archer's bow.
`
There
then!' she cried, placing
adroitly two of her soft fingers,
almost
as
soft as her lips, on his cheek, covering
his eyes with her other soft, warm hand,
and then kissing her two taper fingers,
which as the same moment she tapped
upon his cheek. More experienced
persons
than the burgomaster might have
detected the cheat; but Bertha had
never
kissed the burgomaster, and his cheek
had all his life been sacred to the mater
nal salutation. It was easy to deceive
the inexperienced lover, and he
was
deceived
.
Moreover, the innocent young
Dutchman did not know that a kiss is a
compound article, consisting of two
parts; that it is, indeed, the nuptial
of the lips. But he was made happy,
nevertheless
,
and began to think, with
sparkling eyes, that it was worth a
thousand
dollars to be kissed by Bertha!
Certainly it was worth this sum to have
to kiss him.
`Now, Berthas, vhen shall I haf
anoder
kisses?' he said complacently.
`I dont know. But you must'nt smoke
in here!'
`Vhy not?' he asked, suspending a
fresh pipe, which he had taken from his
pouch in his hand midway in the air, just
as her voice arrested it.
`Because it gets into the curtains and
embroidery; and besides, your soldiers
will be wondering where you are.'
`No tey wont; lets em mind teir own
pusiness; I'm happy.'
`But I must shut up the house!' she
continued, resolved to get him off before
there was any danger of his coming in
contact with Logan.
`Den you cans shut me up in it.'
`But that would be decidedly
improper
!'
`Ant we to be married in elefen tays
after te middle of te next veeks!'
`Slems, you will make me vexed!'
`I vould'nt for te worlts!'
`Then go!'
`Bless my podies; who'd think I half
ony ten minutes ago let her haf a tousan
tollars!' he grumbled, as he rose up and
slowly went out. `Vhen shall I sees you
agen, and haf anoder kisses?'
`Not until you are more obedient!'
`Vera vells, I vill goes. I will smokes
on te stoopes, ant keeps guarts, tat
noting
hurt you nor puts you into alarms!
Who would tink I haf give her tousant
tollar!' he repeated, with strong
emphasis
,
as he went out of the door. `Put I
loves her ant vill not make her angrys.'
With these words and with looks of
very great reluctance and discomposure
at being thus summarily ejected from the
house by the firm little maiden, he made
his appearance at the door. Logan, it
will be remembered, was at the moment
seated by the well-curb, talking with the
soldiers, and beheld him as he came out
`There is our Captain,' said the
corporal
,
`he puffs and blows as if he was
mad at sometings!'
`May I speak to your Captain?' asked
Logan.
`Yash, dere he ish,' responded the
corporal
.
Logan crossed to the stoope where
Slems sat with his sword across his knees
muttering words, all that could be
distinguished
of which was, `tousant tollars.'
`Are you the brave Captain Van Vow?'
asked Logan.
`Bless my podies, here ish a man as
speaks like a gentlemans, if he ish a
fishersman. Yes, I am the braves ant
valiants Captains Van Vow!' answered
the burgomaster, condescendingly.
`I am glad to see you. Have you seen
any thing of my son, a lad of fourteen?
He has strayed, and I fear he'll get into
mischief in this soldierly town.'
`No, I has not seen te lads. Asks
mine soltiers.'
`They have not.'
`Den I dont knows noting apout him.
Go thy vays, or I'll put thee into the
prisons!'
`Where can he be,' thought Logan, as
he left the door and walked slowly down
the street, resolved to endeavour to get
into the house and learn what had
become
of him. He had reached the
corner
when Steiny came full upon him.
`So, you are safe, then,' he exclaimed.
`I was beginning to fear you had got
into difficulty. What have you got there
so heavy?'
`A bag o' rocks to pepper the soldiers
with.'
`It wont do to assail them. You had
best throw it away.'
`No, I'll just hide it under this stone
here so as to be handy, if I want it.'
`Well, do with it as you please, only
tell me quickly if you saw the maiden.'
Steiny hid the bag under a shelving
stone by the fence, where he knew it
would be safe for a while, and then
turning
to Logan gave him, as they walked
along out of the way of the guards, a full
account of all that had passed, save the
negotiation about the money. This, for
private reasons, he was inclined to keep
a secret.
`When I made her think you were
about to be hanged,' said Steiny, `she
looked as if she would have gived her
pretty eyes to save you. She certainly
loves you chappy, and all you've got to
do is to go ahead. I told her you loved
her too, and she's expecting you.'
`Where?'
`Come, and I'll show you. But you
must keep up my game. Make her think
you were going to be hanged down on
the island for stealing dad's scow, and
that you owe your life to her; for I tell'd
her for her sake I'd have you let off.'
`Did she believe I was in danger?'
`Yes, so you must keep it up; coz
she'll believe when she sees you that you
are free, coz she begged for you!'
`She will?'
`Yah. But don't say nothin about the
money.'
`What money?'
`Did I say money?'
`Yes.'
`I meant rocks!'
`What rocks?'
`Them I got hid there.'
I shant trouble them, boy! But where
are you leading me?'
`A round about way to get into the
house.'
`Did she say she wished to see me?'
`Did she? Ask her! She said I
must bring you, for she could not sleep
till she know'd you was safe.'
`Sweet, dear Bertha!'
`Yah, she is a beauty. She's
handsome
as a gold fish. If she leaves you
alone don't go to fishin after her gold
fishes!'
`Is this the place?'
`Yah, a nice snug little door in the
fence. Now keep strait onturn to the
left, go up two steps and knock at the
first door you see under the dark
gallery
.
She'll open it. If she's surprised
to see you, tell her they brought you
over to give you up to the Governor, but
let you go when they saw me and had
three minutes private talk. Now
remember
.'
`I will, answered Logan, laughing.
`And dont mention money and she
wont!' continued Steiny as he was
entering
the gate.
`What do you mean?'
`She said she'd give a thousand
dollars
to keep you from bein hurt, that's
all. So if you mention money she'll
think you've come after it!'
`Well, I wont mention money if it will
relieve you.'
`It will 'mazingly,' answered Steiny
coolly.
`Be by the boat waiting for me till I
come,' said Logan as he was closing the
garden door.
`I rather think I'll look out and find a
safe place for my rocks,' said Steiney
hurrying away to the spot where he had
deposited his bag of gold.
Logan did not knock at the door in
the habit of a fisherman. This he took
off in the garden, and even went so far
as to stop at the cistern and wash his
face and hands so as to get rid of his
brown complexion. This delay to
arrange
his toilet will be overlooked by the
reader when all the circumstances are
taken into consideration. As it was
moonlight he used his sword for a mirror
to arrange his hair and make himself look
presentable. He then advanced to the
door and rapped with inconsiderable
confidence
.
`Who is there?' called the rich voice
of Bertha within.
`One whom you expect!'
She well knew the voice. Her heart
bounded with delight. He was safe!
How soon had he flown to her to thank
her for his life! He was safe! And now
that he was no longer in danger should
she interest herself in him? Would it be
proper to let him come in?
These thoughts chased one another
rapidly through her mind; and yet she
kept turning the lock till the door opened,
as it seemed to her, of itself.
CHAPTER XII.
THE LOVERS AND THEIR ADVENTURE.
To lovers so well prepared as ours were
by Steiney's diplomacy, to meet each
other on good terms, it must of course be
supposed, that that their interview in the
`little back parlor,' was mutually
delightful
.
Logan, if he had before loved only,
now worshipped. She felt, too, that she
could be happy, only with him. For two
hours they remained together, the most
part of which, she spent in trying to
convert
him to protestansism.
`Will you then be mine, dear
beautiful
Bertha?' he said, ardently.
`I cannot promise. I have told you
freely, that you are very dear to me. But
I cannot even think of a papist.'
`I am half a mind to become a
protestant
,
for your sweet sake. But, really,
believing as I do, that you are in an
error
,
a beautiful wandering angel. I
cannot
leave the ways of truth, to pursue you
unless to bring you back to them.
Dearly
as I love you.'
`Do not talk of loving me. It makes
me sad, for I feel we can never meet
again.'
`Nay, this is too dreadful an alterna
tive. Instead of trying to persuade me
to become a protestant, let me persuade
you to become a Roman.'
`No, I can never change my faith, if
it break my heart,' she said, firmly, but
sorrowfully. `I begin to regret that I
have suffered you to see me to night. I
might have forgotten you, if we had not
now met; but now I shall never forget;
and so long as we can never love, it will
be a source of unhappiness to me, to
recur
to this hour of happiness. Sir, it is
best, we should now part forever.'
`No, Bertha. Why should you thus
treat me? Why call me hither to dismiss
me to wretchedness. For you I will do
every thing but forswear my faith. This
I cannot do, even for you.'
`Your promises, even in error, only
makes me esteem, nay love you more.
Every word you utter assures me of your
worth, and how much I lose, in
refusing
to see you mine.'
`Alas, that we should both be thus
firm. But I fear you do not think well
of me, Bertha. Your heart is another's.
Your father told me, you were betrothed
to a certain rich young burgomaster of
the town.'
The young maiden's pretty lip slightly
curled, with a smile of contempt.
`Mr. Logan, if you had ever seen this
favorite of my father's, you would not
charge me with giving him a thought.
No, my heart was never moved, save by
you. But I have told you freely, all my
love. Now let us part, and forget the
one the other.'
`Never, dearest girl.'
`Will you, then, change your faith?'
`No, ask me not.'
`I can never be the wife of a papist,
Robert Logan,' she answered firmly.
`If I will change my religion?'
`I will be your wife, or never wed.'
`Give me three days, to think of this.'
`Willingly. Oh, that you would, at
the end of that time, tell me that you had
become a protestant.'
`When is the day, you were to have
married this burgomaster?'
`Two weeks hence. But fear me not.
I shall never wed any one, but thee.'
After some further conversation, in
which Logan briefly stated to her, that he
intended to remain for the present,
secreted
,
at the house of father Stephen,
whom he intended to consult, touching
the matter of changing his faith, he took
his leave, pressing her to his heart, and
leaving a kiss upon her brow.
In the garden, Logan resumed his
fisherman's
costume, and made his way to
the water-side. He found Steiney
waiting
in the skiff, a little from the land.
He called to him, when the lad, without
moving an oar said, doubtfully,
`Are you mad with me; if you are I'm
off.'
`Mad? No, you have done me good
service,' answered Logan. `Pull into the
shore, and let me get on board.'
Steiney obeyed, quite satisfied, from
the tone of his voice, that Logan had not
discovered the affair of the recent
negotiation
,
he had effected with Bertha.
`I am going down to the island, to re
main with you until to-morrow evening,
and then I think of returning to the town
altogether,' said Logan, as he got into
the boat. `You did me good service
Steiney. You are a useful aid, in affairs
of love.'
I'm glad you're pleased, chappy,'
answered
the boy, in the reckless cool way,
characteristic of him; and as he spoke,
he gave a cautious glance at the cuddie,
where his bag of `rocks' was stowed
safely
away. He then began to sing a tune
to which he kept time with his oars.
The following morning early, Steiny
got his father off in the skiff, before
Logan
was up; and then he took the
opportunity
of thoroughly concealing his
treasure
.
During the day a fisherman
stopped
at the island from town, and
reported
that there was a rumor that Robert
Logan had been in town, and was getting
the catholics to rise and take the fort and
massacre every protestant. Upon hearing
this Logan, surprised at this premature
exposure of his plans, despatched Steiny
to town to learn the facts. The boy was
gone two hours, and upon his return
confirmed
the statement of the fisherman,
adding that soldiers were then searching
every place in town for him, and that
five hundred dollars had been offered for
his head.
`I see that the town is no place for
me for two or three days,' said Logan,
within himself, on hearing this startling
intelligence. `I dont see how it got out
that I was in town, or how the rumor of
the conspiracy got abroad! There was a
traitor last night among us at the priest's
house!'
Logan's suspicions were correct.
The traitor was Courtlandt; who,
finding
the Roman Catholic party likely to
be in the minority, and having the same
night received a note from Bayard, who
knew his man, proposing to him to join
him in establishing a Provincial
Government
in Albany, he abandoned the papist
ranks, to which he had never been a
very firm adherent; and in three hours
after the breaking up of the meeting at
Father Stephen's, he was closeted with
Colonel Bayard at his house.
Courtlandt
proposed that Livingstone should
be invited to join them, and at one
o'clock
in the morning he was sent for.
When he came, and they had laid before
him the whole plan, he at once adopted
it; and the three joined hands to move a
new rebellion against Leisler's. As the
catholic party was now in their way, they
at once resolved to betray the conspiracy
to Leisler, that their hopes might be
defeated
.
A note was therefore sent to him
just before dawn, informing him of the
intentions of the Romans on the ensuing
Sabbath. The note bore no signature,
but Leisler saw that it bore the air of
truth, and regarded it accordingly. The
garrison was doubled, and the strictest
vigilance observed every where. Every
Roman Catholic was forbidden to appear
in the streets without an order or
permission
from the Governor; and as the note
stated that Robert Logan was not only
secreted in the city, but was the leader
of the conspiracy, the reward to arrest
him was largely increased by
proclamation
,
and a search patrol was sent to
enter
every Roman Catholic house in search
of him.
The town, throughout the whole day,
was in the greatest exbitement. Jacob
Leisler removed his daughter to the
fortress
,
both from fear of the catholics and
of Robert Logan. The burgomaster
also took up his abode in the fort; and
greatly did he wonder when Bertha's
little
baggage was removed, what had
become
of his `tousant talers;' for he took
the trouble to lift each small trunk and
box before it was carried into her room;
and he was convinced there was no `
tousant
talers' in any of them. But he said
nothing; he only wondered the more.
Once Bertha, who was quietly observing
him, discovered that he was about to
speak, but putting her fore finger on her
lip she shook her head significantly. He
was silent, but sighed, and looked
amusingly
desponding.
This evenful day had not yet drawn to
a close, when a messenger brought a note
to the Governor. It was from Father
Stephen, who, having discovered to
whom his party owed its betrayal,
addressed
,
in retaliation, a letter to Jacob
Leisler, stating that it would become
him forthwith to arrest Colonel Bayard,
Livingstone and Courtlandt, for they
were about to leave the town for Albany,
to organise there an opposition
Provincial
Gevernment.
Upon getting this intelligence, which
confirmed certain suspicions he had
formed
,
Leisler despatched a force to the
abodes of these gentlemen to arrest them
and defeat their object in the outset.
But thev had already taken flight. Upon
hearing this, Leisler forbade all English
protestants from leaving the town under
pain of arrest. But this proclamation
had little effect. Before daylight nearly
every adherent of Bayard had quitted the
place.
In one respect the perplexed Governor
did not regret their departure; for he
had now but one partythe Roman
Catholic
to
oppose him. Still he felt that
if Bayard should succeed in raising the
standard of William and Mary at
Albany
,
he might lose the Province, and this
he did not wish to do, for the merchant
Governor now begun to feel the
irresistable
lust and pride of power. The
authority
which he had accepted with
reluctance
he now resolved to hold on to
with jealous vigilance.
Logan remained on the island still
another
day and night, not at the
fisherman's
cabin, but in a deserted Indian's
hut, about half a mile from it, where
Steiny visited him and provided him with
food; for Steiny had heard in town that
the Governor intended to send to the
islands
in search of the escaped Secretary,
and he had informed Logan that he and
every fisherman who went to the town,
was closely questioned about him.
Logan
therefore kept himself secluded until
some favorable opportunity should offer
for him to leave his retreat and return
once more to town.
On the second afternoon Steiny
returned
and brought the intelligence of
Bayard's
flight, and the new Government
that was to be established at Albany.
`But this is not the best news I've got
for you,' said the boy. `You see I was
no sooner ashore than a sojer takes me
by the arm and tells me I must go into
the fort and let the Governor talk with
me. I told him the Governor had axed
me yesterday about the Secretary; but
he said that was nothing, and his orders
was to take every fisherman to the fort.
I thought they'd found you out! But no,
the Governor did'nt suspect, he only
axed
me if I'd seen or heard o' such a
person
as you since yesterday. In course I
told him I did'nt. Well, who should I
see but Miss Bertha winking at me. So,
as I had my basket o' fish on my arm I
goes to the window where she was, and
axes her`Buy any fishes!' She told
me to let her see em. So while she was
pretending to admire 'em, she whispers,
`Do you know where
he
is?'
`Sweet girl,' ejaculated Logan,
impassionately
.
`I winked and blinked, and she
understood
.
So she told me to wait a
minute
,
and in a little while she slipped this
bit of paper into my jacket.'
`Why did'nt you tell me before. Let
me see it.'
`I told you as soon as I could. What
a hurry.'
`Logan snatched the note and read:
`Dear Mr. Logan,
If you have a secure shelter,
do not quit it, for your life is in danger.
For my sake do not venture to town
again, as no disguise will protect you.
Have you repentedwill you become a
protestant? I think of you momently.
My father has told me to-day, that I must
positively marry the burgomaster, on pain
of his displeasure. Oh, that you were a
protestant!
The happy, yet unhappy,
Bertha
.'
`Noble, true and good,' exclaimed
Logan
.
`And you saw her; and spoke
with her. How I envy you.'
`To be sure I did,' answered Steiney,
composedly.
`In the meanwhile, Bayard and his
adherents
reached Albany, and raised the
standard of rebellion, against Leisler's
government. Bayard, proclaimed
himself
governor, under William & Mary,
and appointed his council, and
performed
all other acts of power. He seized
the fort there, and declared that he held
it, and the province, for the King and
Queen of Great Britain, and that he would
not maintain any connection with
Leisler
.
Thus was the Province in the hands
of two protestant parties, each party
professing
allegiance to the same sovereign,
and denouncing each other as rebels.
Upon hearing of Bayard's acts at
Albany
,
Leisler sent a messenger to him,
demanding the surrender of the fort.
The messenger was imprisoned for a day,
and then sent back with a similar
demand
,
to Leisler. Each party, now
strengthened itself by every means in its
power. The Roman catholic party, in
the meanwhile, remained quiet, feeling
that its authority and influence were
passed
;
and that they would be compelled to
yield allegiance to the protestant crown.
The chief difficulties, now therefore, were
between the two protestant factions,
Leisler's, however, grew the strongest;
and the second week after the
establishment
of his government, a ship arrived
from England, bringing despatches
addressed
to `the Governor, or
such person
as for the time being, administers the
affairs
of the Province.' The messenger
who brought them, after hearing a
statement
of affairs, delivered the packets to
Leisler, who opened it and read it, as if
directed to himself. From this moment,
he assumed the title and state of
Governor
,
with confidence. Colonel Bayard,
hearing of the arrival of the ship, came,
secretly, to New York, to see the
messenger
,
and lay before him a statement
that should criminate Leisler, hoping he
would lay it before the King. But, the
presence of the opposition leader, being
made known to Leisler, he arrested him
on a charge of rebellion, and cast him
into
prison. The convention, at Albany,
hearing of the arrest of their chief,
dissolved
their government and fled for
safety
,
some to the colony of Massachusetts,
others into New Jersey. There was no
longer, therefore, an organized
opposition
to Leisler's authority.
While Leisler was establishing
himself
upon a height of power, from which
he was soon destined to fall, Logan was
by no means inactive, in carrying on a
minor conspiracy, against his authority.
For nearly two weeks, while all these
important
affairs were proceeding, involving
the interests of so many, he was
privately
corresponding with Bertha, by means
of Steiney, who went, nearly every day,
to the town with fish, of which Bertha,
became suddenly, as both her father and
the burgomaster thought, extravagantly
fond. The tenor of his notes to her, were
earnest entreaties for her to consent to
be his, fly from her hateful union with
Van Vow, elude her father, and meet him
at the house of the priest, where they
would be united; and thence proceed to
England. Her letters to him, were
earnest
entreaties for him to become a
protestant
,
without which she could not think
of him, save as a friend.
At length, the morning of the day
arrived
,
which was set for her to be
married
to the burgomaster. Although in a
note he had received the evening before,
she had said she would not consent to be
his, yet he feared that she might be
prevailed
upon to yield; for she had said
that her father was firm, though she had
implored him with tears, not to sacrifice
her.
`Now, Steiney,' said Logan as the other
prepared to start to town, early in the
morning of the fatal day, `I wish you to
return by noon; for I shall probably go
up with you. Here is money; I want
you to purchase a fish woman's dress,
throughout, cap, bonnet, clogs and all,
and bring them back with you. If I go
to the city, I shall go as your mother, or
aunt.'
Steney grinned with delight, and said
he knew where he could get precisely
such a costume as he wanted. He then
hoisted his little sail, for the wind was
fair, and steered for the town.
`She shall not marry him this night, if
I have to risk my life to rescue her,' said
Logan, as he saw the boat blend with the
distant shore of the town. `She loves
me with all her heart; I will save her
from a union with this man, though mine
she may never be.'
At noon Logan was at his post
looking
off towards the town. His keen eyes
soon detected the little brown sail of the
piroge, and in less than half an hour the
boat was at his feet.
`Have you seen her, Steiny?'
`Yah, master Logan; here is a note,
and in this bundle I have got your
woman's
dress.'
Logan hurriedly tore open the soiled
note, Steiny was not a rose-scented
lady's
page, and it smelled villainously of
fish; though the words were fragrant
with sweetest perfumes of affection.
`Dearest Logan,
I know not what or how to address
you. In a word, if you
would have me,
you must come and take me
! It is in vain
for me so resist my father and Van Vow
conjointly. I must fly from the fort, or
before eight o'clock to-night be the wife
of this hateful simpleton. I have no
escape
unless I take poison or fly to you. I
think nothing of your being a Roman,
for I know when I am your wife you will
isten to me. I think only of my love for
you! of avoiding this horrible fate that
awaits me. My father is stern and
unbending
.
Van Vow is resolute. I have
thrown myself upon the mercy of the
former
in vain; I have entreated the latter
to spare me. I have told him I love him
not, that I cannot love him. He is
without
feeling. He has finally, within the
last half-hour said if I will pay him back
the thousand dollars he will release me.
I am mortified to allude to this, since you
have not done so. But what can I do?
I am in his power. If you can send the
money to me do so at once and let me
return it to him; for if he should inform
my father I shall have to confess all, and
I know not what will be my fate. You
see I write with frankness to you as one
in whom I trust my heart and happiness,
for I believe you truthful and noble, and
that you love me even as I love you. This
is a crisis when it would be weak and
foolish in me to disguise any thing I feel;
and I have not done so. Send the money,
if you can, or let me hear from you.
Bertha
.'
`Money! What can the dear, sweet
child mean?' he exclaimed.
`What does she say about money?'
inquired
Steiny with a guilty look,
overhearing
the words.
`Do you know any thing about this?
What can she mean?'
`What does she say, chappy?'
`That she has obtained a thousand
dollars for me and she seems to think I
have got it. It is all a mystery.'
`It is very mysterious!'
`I don't know what to make of it.
You must go at once and try and see her
again and tell her I have not the money,
but I will come myself as soon as it is
dark. Unless she has this money she
must marry Van Vow of whom she
borrowed
it. But what it was for I cant tell
I know nothing about it. If I had a
thousand dollars at hand I would send it
to her. But I have not the half of it with
me.'
`Must she Marry Van Vow if she dont
get this money?'
`So it seems.'
`Then I'm bless'd if '
Here Steiny interrupted himself and
looked very resolute. Logan went into
his but and tried on his disguise. He
then made his appearance before Steiny
who threw himself on the beach and
rolled
over and over with laughter at the
strapping figure he cut.
`No body'd ever guess you was any
body else than my grandmam!' he cried
out with delight. `Now what are you
going to do?'
`As soon as it is dark go over to the
city and do my best to save Bertha from
her fate. If it were not for this
mysterious
money she talks about there would
be no fears, for Van Vow would give her
up; and we could then get off
to-morrow
.
But it must be done before eight,
or all is lost. Go at once back and tell
her I will meet her at the ever-green oak
outside the fort, if she can escape. Tell
her that it is impossible for me to get the
money she wishes to-night, and she must
trust to flight alone for escape.'
Steiny, after getting into his boat and
under sail, turned in shore to a wooded
rock and disappeared for about ten
minutes
,
when Logan saw him re-appear,
lugging something into the boat, when
he immediately set sail again.
Bertha was in her room sad and
thoughtful when she saw Steiny reappear
crossing the yard of the fort; for he had
become so well known he was, like many
others, let in and out at will during
daylight
;
but at dark the gates were all
closed and strictly guarded; though now
that Bayard was in its prison there was
comparative quiet in the town. She saw
the boy's fish basket seemed to be very
heavy and her heart bounded, for she
believed he brought the means to pay the
burgomaster.
`Nice fish, ma'm,' said the boy in a
loud tone. `Here's nice gold fish too,' he
added significantly.
`Has he sent it?'
`Yah, just as you gave it to me. To
tell you the truth, ma'm, he didn't never
know we axed a thousand dollars to let
him off. That was a cheat to get the
gold out o' you. He never knew of it.
He thought it was only by your influence
over us, you see. He dont know I got
a dollar, or he'd a blowed me! So when
he read your note and I found I'd got you
into a scrape, I jist goes and digs up the
bag I'd hid and brings it off to you.
Here it is, ma'm, just as it was, and I'm
dd sorry I flamgusted yer to get it.
Jist take it and give it to fat cheeks and
let him go cry!' With these words he
placed the bag on the floor of the gallery.
`You are a noble and honest youth.
Mr. Logan shall know this, if I ever am
so happy as to see him again, and you
shall be rewarded more than this. You
have done me a greater service than you
suppose by bringing it. Shall I see him?'
she asked eagerly.
`Yah. He says he'll be from seven
to eight o'clock at the oak out by the
wall. He says you must try and baulk
Mynheer and your dad, and meet him.'
`Happy news! Tell him I will be
there.'
`Then hadn't you better keep the
thousand?'
`No; it must be returned to him. It
will solace him. Besides, he shall have
no word to say against Bertha Leisler's
fair name!'
At a few minutes before eight o'clock
the same evening, a lad and a tall person
habited as a fisher's wife, were standing
beneath an oak that grew near the wall,
when a young man, wrapped in a cloak,
came hurriedly towards them. Logan,
half guessing who it might be, bounded
forward with Steiny.
`Bertha!' he said softly.
`Robert!' was the rapid answer. `I
should not have known you but for
Steiny
!
We have no time to lose! I shall
be missed in five minutes! Let us fly!'
As they went swiftly along, she told
him that all was ready for the bridal, and
she had seemed so quietly to consent that
they left her alone. Many guests had
come, and she let them continue to
assemble
;
and even the burgomaster she
had seen go into the room where he was
to wait for her; for Van Vow, though he
had his money again, had now no power
to act as he had pledged to, for her
father
insisted that the nuptials should take
place. Thus had Steiny lost his `bag of
rocks' without benefit to Bertha, though
very much to the honer of his own
generous
nature; and we trust every candid
reader will give him credit for the deed,
as much as if Bertha had been benefitted
by it.
`I waited till the last moment,'
continued
Bertha to the happy and listening
Logan, `when I suddenly quitted my
room, entered the hall, and catching up
a cap and cloak, upon which I had
previously
fixed my eyes, I hastened from
the door, leaving my dressing-maid to
believe that I had only stepped into the
library. Thus I got safely from the
house; and, having the countersign, I
was suffered to pass out of the gate by
the sentry without question, he doubtless
taking me for one of the guests who had
been invited to the wedding. I hurried
away from the gate and at length
discovered
you. Now I am happy.'
`And
I
perfectly, dearest Bertha,'
responded
Logan as he hastened on
towards
the residence of father Stephen.
CHAPTER XIII.
THE BRIDAL SCENE IN THE GARRISON.
When
the guests were all assembled
in the large drawing-room of the
Governor's
house, within the Castle, the
latter
dressed as became a Governor at the
bridal of his only daughter, entered,
accompanied
by the Lutheran minister in
his black cassock and round skull-cap.
Mr. Leisler bowed to his friends and
other guests, about twenty in number,
who had been invited to the ceremony.
In one corner sat the burgomaster's little
mother, in a starched ruff and gay cap,
and seemingly very proud and happy at
the prospect of being related, by the
marriage
of her son, to the family of the chief
ruler of the province. The Governor,
after bowing around to the guests,
advanced
towards her, when she rose up,
and, smiling, made him a low, formal
courtesy.
`Where is your son and
mine
, fair
vrow?' he asked, with looks of
satisfaction
.
`The hour is within three minutes
of the time when the nuptials are to take
place.'
`He is in te next room, waiting to pe
called, your excellencies,' responded the
good vrow. `Pless you,sir, he seems very
much afraid; but it is naturals, for one
isn't married every days.'
`I will go and take him to my
daughter's
room, so that together they can
enter
the parlor, as is seemly they should.
This must be a happy day to you,
dame.'
`It is, your excellencies, fery
happies
,'
responded the good lady,
courtseying
to the floor as the Governor turned
from her to speak to the minister.
`Reverend sir, I believe it is now time
for the couple to come in. Are you
ready to perform the ceremony?'
`I am all prepared to do my duty, your
excellency,' answered the clergyman, in
a strong nasal tone.
The Governor then passed out into
the apartment on the left of the
mantel-piece
.
It was a sort of ante-room to the
parlor. In it, for the last ten minutes,
Mynheer Van Vow had been alternately
perspiring with fear and chilling with
apprehension. It seemed well for him,
as his good mother had remarked to the
Governor, that people were not married
every day. He was plainly very much
excited for a gentleman of his phlegm.
He was full dressed in a fawn-colored
broad-skirted coat, faced with white
satin, scarlet breeches, and blue clocked
hose that showed to advantage his
shapely
calf; he had a lawn ruffle in his
bosom
of amplest breadth, and upon his
wrists were displayed cuffs of
embroidered
lace. His hair was brushed carefully
back into a short pig-tail, that stuck
straight over on his collar, and was
garnished
with white ribbons in a true-love's
knot, tied by his careful and prideful
mother. His head was white with
powder
.
In his hands he carried a pair of
dove-colored kid gloves, and upon the
first joint of the little finger of his left
hand was a very small plain gold ring,
the circle with which he purposed to
bind the fair Bertha to his side for the
present life. The finger being very
small which the ring was intended for,
and the fingers of the burgomaster being
shaped like blue-nose potatoes, it was
really a wonder how he managed to get
it even upon the first joint of his lesser
finger.
`Well, Mynheer Van Vow, I see you
are ready for the ceremony,' he said,
surveying
his buckish appearance. `The
hour is at hand.'
`I am fery glat, for I am losin my
courages fast, Governors. It melts avay
off mine fingers. Vhere is Berthas?'
`She is also doubtless ready in her
apartment, and only waiting for me to
conduct you to her. Give me thine
arm.'
`Good Governors,' said the
burgomaster
,
hesitating and feeling that he was
about to sacrifice a lovely maiden who
loved him not, `I would mush rathers
disweddings
didn't pe.'
`What! do you at this hour renew
your objections. Tell me fairly, what is
your reason for not wishing this union?'
demanded the Governor sternly.
`I knows Berthas doesn't loves me. I
knows, if I marries her, she'll be
misrable
as ever vas.'
`And it is only on this account?'
`Yes, none oder; for I loves her mit
all mine souls and podies.'
`Then you shall wed her. I am not
to yield my purpose up to an idle whim
on her part. I have questioned her
about this repugnance to you; but she
gives me no satisfactory reply. I shall not
now heed-her weak objections to a union
upon which I have set my heart. Do not
offend me by any more resistance. These
times that have come upon us are rife
with danger to us all, and especially to
me. I am surrounded with enemies.
My life may yet be sacrificed. Bertha,
at such a crisis, needs a protector. You
are a suitable one, and I know will love
and honor her. When she is married to
you, one great source of anxiety will be
removed from my mind, and I shall be
freer to give myself to the weighty duties
of my station. Follow me. Mynheer, and
let there be no further obstacle to my
wishes. I need not remind you that while
she remains unwedded she is exposed to
danger from the machinations of this
adventurer
,
Logan. Come, let the nuptials
be performed at once.'
Thus speaking, the Governor walked
to a door at the side of the ante-room,
passed through a narrow entry, and then
stopping before a closed door at its
extremity
,
knocked upon it, saying,
`Come, Bertha, the guests wait. I
have led hither thy husband betrothed.
Come out and go with him to the
drawing-room
.
It is now the full hour set for
the nuptials.'
There was no reply. The Governor
listened for a moment and then opened
the door just as it was opened from
within
by Bertha's Dutch dressing maid.
`Where is thy mistress?' asked the
Governor, looking around the chamber.
`She went into your book-room to
speak wit you, she said,' responded the
woman.
`In the library? I have not seen her.
Perhaps she waits me there.'
Thus speaking, he passed through an
inner door, and entered a room used as a
library and office. There was no light in
it; and, after calling upon his daughter's
name, he sent back the burgomaster for
one of the candles that stood upon the
toilet table. The room was now surveyed,
and a glance showed him that his
daughter
was not there.
`How long since did she leave her
room to say she was coming in here?' he
asked the dressing-maid.
`About five or six minutes. She told
me to stay here and wait for her.'
`I have not seen her, answered the
Governor with the first emotions of
suspicion
.
`Perhaps she has gone into the
drawing-room. Come with me,
Mynheer
.
Doubtless she waits you there.'
Encouraging his fears with this hope,
he hastened back into the drawing-room.
`Has my daughter been in here?' he
demanded, turning pale, as his eye did
not encounter her form in the room.
`She has not yet made her
appearance
,
your excellency,' answered the
minister. `Yet I am ready to perform
the ceremony of marrying her to the
worthy burgomaster.'
Van Vow, I begin to mistrust evil,'
said the Governor. `Go and search
every part of the house each of you here.
My daughter has disappeared. He who
finds her shall have a hundred marks.'
Her father hastened from room to
room till satisfied that she had flown,
when he flew to the sentry at the gate.
`Has my daughter passed out?
`No, your excellency.'
`Has any one?'
`A young man.'
`How long ago?'
`About ten minutes, your excellency.'
`How was he habited?'
`In a cap and cloak.'
`Did you see his face?'
`No, your excellency,' responded the
soldier; he kept his cap down, and
besides
it was dark, as you see, in the
passage
way. He gave the countersign as I
let him forth.'
`It must have been
she
! repeated the
Governor, in amazement. `She has fled
disguised! But I will soon learn!'
He hastened back to the house, which
was all in confusion. The house had
been thoroughly searched, and no
discovery
had been made of the missing
maiden
.
`Look you, my friends, and see who
misses a cloak and cap!'
`I do, your excellency,' answered a
young Dutch gentleman, pressing
forward
.
`Then I am dishonored and made
ashamed before you all by my own child.
She has flown from the fort, disguising
herself in the cap and cloak. Ho, guards!
to your arms!' he shouted. `Disperse
yourselves through the streets! Search
every nook about the fortress! Hasten!
She has ten minutes the start, but she
may yet be taken! He who brings her
back to me shall be paid two hundred
marks of silver! But heed ye, soldiers;
lay not a hand roughly upon the child,
for remember she is still, though a
fugitive
,
the Governor's daughter!'
`Dish ish a fery astonishing pusiness!'
gasped the burgomaster as soon as he
could fairly realise that Bertha had flown.
`I do wouders vhere she can pe goings?'
I fear that this Logan has something
to do in this!' responded the Governor,
pacing up and down in front of the gate
of the fortress, in great perturbation.
`You seem to take her departure with
sufficient philosophy, Mynheer Von Vow,'
he cried angrily, seeing the burgomaster's
visage.
`I would rathers she runs afay from
me now tan afder the marriages,'
answered
the Dutch lover with calmness.
Indeed
,
in his heart, the burgomaster did
not feel sorry at her departure. He felt
that if she would fly to avoid a marriage
with him she would never have made him
a happy husband; and so long as he had
got his thousand dollars back again he
was disposed to regard this turn in the
affair as advantageous than otherwise.
Not so her father. His bosom was torn
with mingled grief, alarm and anger. At
one time he would pour upon her head
the bitterest invectives; at another, call
upon her name with thrilling tenderness.
In vain his friends tried to console him.
He would not be comforted.
One after the other the soldiers whom
he had dispatched in search of the
fugitive
returned from the pursuit, reporting
their want of success. The affection of
the father now began to take the
ascendancy
of paternal resentment, and he
began
to fear lest she might have been
driven
by her antipathy to the burgomaster
to throw herself into the water. He was
about to hasten to the beach in the rear
of the fortress to have search made for
her, when the sentry handed him a note,
which he said a lad had placed in his
hand and immediately ran away. It was
from Bertha, without date or place, but
assuring him of her
safety
.
The lovers reached the gate of the
garden
in which stood the priest's residence,
without having met with any obstacle.
To the challenges of the sentries, which
they encountered, they had the
countersign
,
which carried them safely from
street to street, until they had passed the
lines.
`Now, dearest Bertha, we are in
safety
,'
cried Logan, as he heard the
foot-step
of the priest approaching towards
the gate.
`Who seeks admittance?' demanded
the voice of Father Stephen from within
the garden.
`It is Logan, revered father!'
responded
the young man in an under tone.
`Hasten to open to us, for I bring with
me a priceless treasure.'
The priest slowly opened the gate, but
seeing the disguises, half-closed it with
quick caution.
`Nay, it is I, though in a strange garb,
good father,' answered Logan.
`I know thy voice, son. Come in,'
answered the priest, opening the gate to
admit them. `But who have you with
you?'
`You shall know presently,' was the
reply of the young man as he drew
Bertha
,
trembling with mingled fear and
gladness, into the garden walk. Steiny
followed closely, while father Stephen
relocked
the gate and followed his guests
towards his house.
Logan conducted Bertha into the
sitting-room
,
and breathing into her ears a
few words of encouragement, threw aside
his disguise and went into the hall where
father Stephen stood.
`Reverend father, I need your holy
services in a matter dear to my heart.
The maiden with me is Bertha Leisler!'
`What, the daughter of the heretic
Governor?'
`Do not take fire too quickly, dear
father
Stephen! She is my betrothed wife.
She has fled this night from a hated uniou
with the burgomaster Van Vow to become
my
bride. But you knew that I loved
her. Will you unite us at once in the
chapel?'
`Has she acknowledged our holy
religion
?'
`Not yet, but I am in hopes I shall be
able to bring her over to the true faith, by
and by. But let not this prevent your
complying with my desire.'
`It shall not, Master Logan, though I
would rather she had embraced the true
faith. But before you take this step, let
me suggest to you, that by having the
new Governor's daughter in your power,
you can'
`Can
what
?' demanded the young man
with a flashing eye, as if he half
anticipated
his proposition.
`Hold her as a hostage for her father's
good behavior. Nay, you can compel
him to resign his usurped power,
menacing
his daughter with death.'
`Do you think me an assassain! Do
you judge me to be thus base? Some vile
spirit hath put these words into your
mouth, reverend father, for surely they
came not from youa heart. Bertha
Leisler
is dearer to me than life; she is to
become
my honored and beloved wife.'
`Forgive me, my son; I did but speak
with policy for thy own interests. Take
the maiden by the hand and follow me
into the church.'
With these words, the priest passed
across the hall into the long room, in which
we have already seen the conspirators
assembled. He advanced to the altar, at
its eastern extremity and lighted four
wax tapers that stood upon it, two on
either side of a small silver crucifix, of
exquisite workmanship, executed by
Benvenu'o
Cellini, as the signature upon the
pedestal bore witness. The apartment
was about twenty-four feet long, by
fifteen
broad, was hung with black cloth,
upon which all around the walls were
suspended
pictures of the various passions of
the redeemer. Small as it was it had a
solemn
religious air; and the faint light of
the tapers, almost obscured by the black
hue of the walls increased this effect.
Father Stephen now opened a small
closet on the left of the altar, from which
he took forth his snow white surplice.
He put it on, took a missal in his hand,
and, placing himself by the right of the
altar awaited the bridal pair.
`Do not fear, sweet Bertha,' said Logan
as she shrunk back upon the threshold
of the chapel, awed by its gloomy solem
nity, the tapers, the priest in his white
robes, and the deep silence that reigned.
`I do not fear, Robert,' she answered
firmly, and entering with him at the same
time, into the chapel.
`Kneel children,' said father Stephen,
in a grave voice, as they approached the
altar, by which he stood awaiting them.
In silence, together, they knelt before
him hand clasped in hand. The priest
then opened the missal, and proceeded in
the most impressive manner to perform
the ceremony of marriage. The sacred
rites which were to bind two loving
congenial
hearts forever in one, were at
length finished. When father Stephen
had pronounced the blessing upon their
union, both Bertha and Logan responded
a heartfelt `Amen.' The happy
bridegroom
then raised his joyful, trembling
bride, and calling her by the endearing,
protecting appellation of `wife,' than
which, no word is sweeter to a woman's
ear, folded her to his trustful heart.
Their happiness at this moment, who
can depict? It could only be measured
by the obstacles which had been so
perseveringly
encountered to attain it.
Bertha now began to think of her
father's
anxiety, on account of her sudden
disappearance, and to sympathise with
his distress. Knowing that she was safe,
she easily prevailed upon Logan to
consent
that Steiney should be sent to the
fortress with a note, merely informing
him of her safety. We have seen that
Steiney faithfully executed the mission
entrusted to him. The note read as
follows
:
My dear Father,
Forgive the step I have taken.
I could
NOT
become the wife of Mynheer
Van Vow.I write to assure you of my
safety
.
Your still affectionate
Bertha
.
From Philadelphia, whither the happy
pair, accompanied by Steiny, the next
day fled, Logan addressed a letter to the
father of his young bride, enclosing one
also from her, explaining fully all that
had transpired. In a few days
afterwards
they set sail for London.
The following year Logan came to his
inheritance and title as Earl of Rochfort;
and never was a fairer Countess of that
name and rank than the young and lovely
Countess Bertha.
But it was not long after her elevation
to a coronet that she was called to mourn
the lamentable destiny of her misguided
father. Bayard's messenger had first got
the King's ear, and Leisler was
pronounced
by the crown `a Rebel.'
Thereupon
he resisted the new royal Governor
that was sent over, and fortified himself
in the citadel. But at length he was
compelled to surrender; was tried as a
rebel, convicted and shortly after
executed
,
a victim, as is well known, to party
malignity; for his judges were his most
bitter political and religious opponents.
`The first,' says the historian of the
period
,
`to raise the standard of William
and Mary in America, he was the first
to suffer as a traitor. He had appealed
to the King, but in vain, for mitigation
of the sentence of his provincial judges.'
But the appeal which had been denied
him during life was prosecuted after his
death by Logan before the throne. It
was successful. An Act of Parliament,
vainly resisted by the Judge who
condemned
him to die, did justice to his
memory by reversing the attainder.
In conclusion, it is our painful duty to
add that the burgomaster, as he had
shared the fortunes of his friend Jacob
Leisler, so in death he was united with
him. He was executed with him, to the
last declaring his innocence of any
bloodthirsty
intentions. His fortune, by will
he desired to be left to Bertha; thus to
the last manifesting towards her the most
faithful and touching attachment. We
record this fact in order that the last
impressions
of the reader concerning the
persevering lover may be tinged with that
respect which is due to his memory.
Steiny, patronised by Logan, became a
flourishing sea-captain when he grew up,
and in the wars with Spain, twenty-six
years after his departure from the
Province
,
commanded a Pink of ten guns,
with which he did such good service that
a brig was given him. He was finally
killed in a battle with a Turkish frigate,
at the moment the frigate struck her
colours to his own. A newspaper of this
day, alluding to the battle and his fall,
styles him, `Captain Stein Sneek, a
gallant
officer, a skilful seamen, and an
honest man, who made our national flag
respected wherever he displayed it,
whether
it were before friend or foe.'
THE END.Fort York,
May, 1689.
Sir: Knowing that you possess no
little
influence and the confidence of the
Protestant citizens, and believing that a
communication to you will be the same
as to them in the aggregate, I proceed to
inform you that Lieutenant Colonel
Nictolson
;
late acting Governor of this
Province
,
under a commission from King
James II, having refused to acknowledge
the authority of William, the Prince of
Orange, has seen fit to abdicate his
government
.
He has this night past
embarked
on board a Swedish ship now in the
harbor, and will sail at once for Europe.
It was his desire that I should accompany
him; but as it does not suit my purposes
to quit the Province just now, I remain.
Now herewith I propose to surrender the
post and all appertaining to it to you, for
the sum of ten thousand pounds;
otherwise
I shall defend it with the soldiers
that are in it, against you and yours to
to the last extremity.
Yours respectfully
Robert Logan
.
P S. I shall give you until noon to
decide whether you will save
blood-sheding
or no.'`
To their most Sacred Majesties
,
William & Mary
,
`You perceive, gentleman,' he said as
they read the address, at the begining,
`that I have anticipated your suggestion.
I was interrupted, by your calling, in the
composition of a solemn remonstrance to
their Majesties, against Leisler's
government
.
I will read to you, what I have
written.'
They listened to the address with deep
attention; and when he had concluded
they both pronounced it satisfactory.
`When that is read by the King,' said
Livingstone, `Leisler's fate is sealed. He
will be put under an arrest by an order
from the crown and sent home to be
tried!'
`How shall you forward this?' asked
Logan.
`By a trusty horseman who is at this
moment making himself ready to start as
soon as I seal and direct it. He goes to
Boston and thence takes the ship to
England
.
He has orders not to stay travel
until he reaches the foot of the throne
and sees the letter in the King's own
hand delivered!'
`Leisler has then placed a rope around
his own neck,' said Livingstone, with
stern bitterness. `We are well pleased
at finding you in this mind! Let no
delay
intervene. If Jacob Leisler suspects
or gets wind of this messenger, he will at
once, having the power, despatch a
vessel
direct to forestall you, and so
represent
the necessity of his taking upon him
the controul of affairs that we and not he
will be proclaimed the rebels!'
`He shall not know it. No man has
had breath of it save you two!'
`And that we may not delay you in
finishing it, nor your messenger from his
saddle, we will take our leave, having
effected
that which brought us hither,' said
Livingstone.
`I will not urge you to stay; but Mr.
Logan, pray by what steps do you hope
to destroy Leisler's power?'
`The most effectual way, sir, is by this
division among the protestants carried
out into open war!'
`How do you mean?'
`I mean that you form at once a strong
party, unite with ours and thus endeavour
to overthrow his!'
`He could not withstand the two
combined
,'
said Livingstone.
`But suppose we combine and overturn
his government, who then, Mr. Logan, you
or I will be elevated to the authority?'
asked Colonel Bayard, with a significant
smile.
`I should not, sir, much as I esteem
you personally, consent that a protestant
should succeed,' answered Logan, firmly,
`It would be exchanging a penny for a
penny!'
`And I, sir,' answered Colonel
Bayard
,
`could not, much as I esteem you
personally, consent to use my influence
to replace a paplst in power. If I
combine
with you and organize an Episcopal
party, it will be that I may overthrow
Leiler; but I cannot consent to help put
a Roman Catholic in his place. We have
had enough of Romanism under Dongan,'
answered Colonel Bayard in a severe
tone.
`I perceive, sir,' responded Logan,
colouring, yet keeping his temper, `that
we have too many points of difference to
amalgamate as a party; but we agree
both in branding Leisler with rebellion!'
`That we agree in!' answered the
protestant
leader, with decision.
`We are then of one mind in a chief
point. There let it rest.'
`There is one thing I would ask of
you, Colonel Bayard?' said Livingstone
in an impressive manner.
`I will hear you, my dear sir.'
`If the Roman Catholics rise in a body
to overthrow Leisler without your
co-operation
,
will you remain passive? If
you assist not us, will you refuse to assist
them?'
`This you may depend upon. But I
also will put a question to you Mr.
Logan
?
If
I
raise a party to overturn
Leisler before you make any such
movement
,
will you remain passive?'
`We will remain passive so far as that
we will not aid Leisler against you; but
I boldly assure you, Colonel,' continued
Logan with a resolute air, `that if you
overthrow Leisler and assume his
authority
,
I shall feel it my duty to
endeavour
by overturning
your
governmant to
re-establish that which he has usurped!'
`We then understand one another,'
answered Colonel Bayard in a fearless,
frank manner.
The two Catholic gentlemen now took
their leave with courtesy, and were let
out of the door by their host, who gave
to each of them his hand as if they were
between the utmost harmony on all points.
`We have gained one thing by this
visit,' said Logan, as they passed down
the avenue; `and this is the knowledge
that Bayard contemplates a revolution;
and that we can't act too speedily. We
have to fear him, quite as much as
Leisler
!'
`The politics of our poor Province,'
said Livingstone, `are in a strange way.
Three parties, and nearly equal in
strength, are about to divide and tear the
land! But it is fortunate for us that the
protestants are at dissension. United,
we should be defeated by them; but
dissevered
as they are we can singly oppose
them. It is well we did not unfold all
our plan to Bayard. He
might
have
betrayed
it, because we are papists,
especially
if he found that he could not get
his party in force to prevent our attack
on Sunday. You were very prudent to
check yourself as you did!'
`I perceived that he had no sympathy
with us, and that the only union that
could be between us would be based
upon
our mutual opposition to Leisler's
government. Here we are now at the
entrance of the main street. Shall you
return to father Stephen's?'
`Yes, and report the result of our
interview
with Bayard! Which way do
you take?'
`I proceed down in the direction of
Maiden Lane.'
`Take care of yourself, my friend, or
Leisler will have you in his hands. You
are aware of the reward he has offered
for you?'
`Yes. I shall not remain in the town.
I have a safe retreat at a fisherman's hut
on Governor's Island. I shall, however,
be present at Father Stephen's on
Saturday
night.'
The two conspirators then parted,
Livingstone
following a path along the skirts
of the town, which brought him, after
five minutes' walk, to the field-gate of
the priest's garden; while Logan took
the side-walk along a narrow lane, which
was subsequently named, after the Prince
of Orange, William street, and after
answering
three challenges by as many sen
tries, reached the front of Jacob Leisler's
house. To his surprise he found the well
occupied by the soldiers of Van Vow's
guard, who were lazily seated about
upon
the benches around it, under the trees,
some of them smoking, others talking,
while one of their number paced up and
down between the well-curb and the
house, acting as sentinel.
Logan advanced with precaution, and
not seeing any thing of Steiny, he began
to entertain some apprehensions as to his
fate. Van Vow was also no where
visible
.
Resolved to ascertain, Logan at
once assumed the tipsy air of a fisherman
who had drank rather too much, and
reeled towards them, singing,
`
I am a fisherman bold and free
,
I sail a king upon the sea
,
The blue wide sea!'
`Who goes dere?' cried the sentry.
`A king!' answered Logan, reeling
and speaking in a drunken tone. `A
king o' the sea!'
`He's a fishermans,' said one of the
men on the well-curb. `He ish trunks.'
`Drunk! I am not drunk; I am as
souber as a judge. Who says I am
drunk?'
`Stand and give te word!' cried the
soldier.
`Who are you? What word?'
`The pass-wort!' responded the
sentry
,
placing his gun at his breast.
`The Prince and the King. Whorray
for King Billy.'
`He ish a true man,, said the sentry,
looking at his comrades for their
affirmation
.
`But he must be take up.'
`Yish, he ish true mansh,' was the
response
.
`But ant you te mansh as lost
you poat?'
`I am the man,' answered Logan,
deliberately
taking a seat upon one of the
benches. `You take me up, eh! I'd
thank you to take me over to my island.'
`The man dat stole your poat,' said
another of the soldiers, taking his pipe out
of his mouth and filling it with fresh
tobacco
,
`was the Papist secretary.'
`Logan, you mean.'
`Yish; they say he gone away in her.
He is hid down by te islands.'
`No; he went in the ship you may be
sure. But what are you doing here.'
`Keepin' guart, as you sees.'
`On what?'
`On te Governor's house.'
`Where is your captain?'
`He ish in te house. Don't you know
he ish Mynheer Van Vow, te
burgomeister
,
ash ish goin' to marry de dochter ov
Jacops Leisler?'
`What can a poor fishermans know?'
said one of the men.
`And tipsy at that,' rejoined another
with a laugh.
`I'm not so drunk as I did not know
Mynheer Van Vow is engaged to the new
Governor's daughter,' answered Logan.
`So he is in there.
`Yish; where should he pe put in
dere?' answered the soldier, taking a
long satisfactory whiff from his pipe.
`I'll sit here and smoke with you if
one of you will lend me a pipe,' said
Logan
,
placing his hand familiarly on the
shoulder of his nearest neighbor.
A pipe was very cordially given, and
having lighted it, the disguised secretary
proceeded to smoke and chat away with
the soldiers, artfully drawing from them
all they knew touching affairs in the fort,
as well as the engagement between the
little burgomaster and the beautiful
Bertha
.
From them he learned, also, that
no fisher-lad had been seen by them,
from which he suspected that Steiny was
still in the house, and perhaps unable to
escape. He, therefore, had made up his
mind to go and kock at the door and ask
for him, when the door opened and Van
Vow made his appearance in great
bodily
perturbation.
But, before recounting the events that
followed his appearance, we will follow
Steiny into the house on his mission.
After he had got into the entry, he was
met by Bertha, who, with a light in her
hand, looked at his face closely, and then
told him to follow her. She led him to
a small back sitting room, where, having
set the light down and closed the door,
she said,
`Now, good fisher-lad, tell me
speedily
what this is you have for my private
ear.'
Steeiny, instead of immediately
replying
,
stood gazing with admiration and
wonder upon her extremely beautiful
face. He had never seen any thing, as
he subsequenty declared, half so
handsome
.
Before he could recover his
tongue to reply, a knock was heard at
the street door.
`There is another,' she said
impatiently
,
as if she did not care to be
interrupted
.
`Brecket,' she said, going to the
room door, `go to the upper window and
look down and tell me who it is that calls:
Now, my boy, thy errand quickly.'
`Well, ma'am,' said Steiny, `I'm
blowed if your eyes don't make me all of
a quirl. They shine jist like two drops o'
water sparkling in shells!'
`Was that what you had to tell me, you
freckled little rogue, hey?' said Bertha
laughing.
`No, that's my own errand; but what
I have to tell you, comes from another
guess sort o' person than Steiney Sneek.'
`Who can it be? Who sent you?'
`Ma'am!' cried Brecket, appearing at
the door.
`Well.'
`It is the burgomaster.'
`The plague! What says he?'
`He wants to come in, and smoke his
pipe with you,' said Brecket, delivering
also, the whole of Van Vow's message;
to which, Bertha, with an annoyed air,
sent the reply, already recorded, as
delivered
by Brecket from the window, to
the philosophical Van Vow.
`Now, my boy, who sent thee?'
inquired
Bertha, closing the door; `sit down and
tell me.'
`I'm afraid you wont like to hear.'
`Then you should not have thought of
giving me a message, improper for me to
listen to,' she said, reproachingly, and
with a maiden's reserve.
`It aint cozactly improper, ma'am, but
it might'nt please you.'
`Why not. Tell me who it is from?'
she asked with a considerable degree of
curiosity, yet, not with too much
eagerness
.
`To tell you who it is, is the who,'
responded
Steiney, very intelligibly.
`How oddly you talk. I shall send
you away, and let whoever gave you a
message to me, find some other person to
deliver it; for I see I can get nothing
from you.'
`Well, I'll tell you, if you'll promise
not to be angry.'
`I promise you!' responded Bertha,
still, wholly at a loss to guess who had
sent him, though it would be doing
Logan
injustice, to say, that he did not once
enter into her mind, as she ran over in her
thoughts, the probabilities of who might
be the person.
`You know feyther had his boat stole.'
`Yes, and you have been paid for it,
three marks and a half.'
`Do you know who stole the boat?'
`How should I?'
`Well,
I
know,' answered Steiney,
significantly
.
`Then, why do you not secure the
thief?'
`I've got him.'
`You have?' she exclaimed with
surprise
.
`Yes.'
`Then, where is your boat?'
`I've got that, to.'
`And your three marks and a half!
You are a young rogue, sirrah.'
`Dont call me names, ma'am. Here's
your money agen, if that's all makes you
talk.'
`I don't want it. What have you said
you wished to see me for? You are
trifling
with me.'
`No, I ain't. I like you too well for
that. You see I come here, to tell you I
got the thief.'
`And why do you thing it necessary to
tell me?'
`Because, I guess as how you'd like to
know.'
`How troublesome you act. If you
have anything to say, out with it.'
`Well, you see father's skiff was down
by the ditch, at the back o' the fort, this
mornin', where he left it, and when he
went after it, to go home, for we lives
down on Governor's island, he found it
gone. He hunted heaven and earth for
it, and then took to swearin' and gets
drunk. Well, he did'nt find it in tipsy
town, and so when he gets sober agen,
which he did, arter two hours' nap; he
goes to the new Governor, your dad, I
guess he be. He tells the Governor,
and'
`But what has this to do with message
you had to me?'
`Well, a good deal, because the
message
is from the thief.'
`From the thief!'
`Yes. You see, we cocht him down at
the island with the boat, coz he did'nt
know he was comin with it, right where
it belonged. So we grabbed him, and
when feyther got home in a neighbor's
boat, we built a gallows, as high as a
ship's mast, to hang him on.'
`Hang him for stealing a boat,' she
cried, with a shudder.
`Sartain ma'am.'
`But it would be murder, without the
law. Are you fishermen heathens?'
`Not quite, ma'am. But he stole the
boat without law, and we mean to hang
him without law. That's what we calls
even: and then he deserves to be hanged
besides, cause he is a papist.'
`That is bad, but still, you have no
right to hang him. I am glad you let me
know this. I will at once see my father,
and he will take the matter in hand.'
`And he will hang him, sure.'
`If he does, it will be by the law.'
`Wall, I reckon yon would'nt like to
have him hung, law or no law, if you
guessed who it was.'
`Do I know?'
`You've seen him, and he's seen you.
He is the man that sent me to you, to see
if you would try and save his neck.'
`Who is it? If the poor wretch were
a total stranger to me, I would try to
save him. But, he says he has seen me.
Is he one of the towns folk?'
`Yes.'
`Hang him for stealing a canoe!'
`Yes, he'll be hanged, unless you can
do something for him. He asked us to
spare his life, till he could send word to
you; and gave us fifty dollars to do it,
that's why I come to know what you
would do for him.'
`A man who could pay fifty dollars,
steal a canoe. This is strange! What
is his name? I will save him if I can.
It is horrible to hang a man so
barbarously
,
were he the veriest wretch on earth.
What name has he?'
`Robert Logan,' answered Steiney, in
a quiet tone, closely watching the effect
of the name upon her countenance.`Dear Mr. Logan,
If you have a secure shelter,
do not quit it, for your life is in danger.
For my sake do not venture to town
again, as no disguise will protect you.
Have you repentedwill you become a
protestant? I think of you momently.
My father has told me to-day, that I must
positively marry the burgomaster, on pain
of his displeasure. Oh, that you were a
protestant!
The happy, yet unhappy,
Bertha
.'`Dearest Logan,
I know not what or how to address
you. In a word, if you
would have me,
you must come and take me
! It is in vain
for me so resist my father and Van Vow
conjointly. I must fly from the fort, or
before eight o'clock to-night be the wife
of this hateful simpleton. I have no
escape
unless I take poison or fly to you. I
think nothing of your being a Roman,
for I know when I am your wife you will
isten to me. I think only of my love for
you! of avoiding this horrible fate that
awaits me. My father is stern and
unbending
.
Van Vow is resolute. I have
thrown myself upon the mercy of the
former
in vain; I have entreated the latter
to spare me. I have told him I love him
not, that I cannot love him. He is
without
feeling. He has finally, within the
last half-hour said if I will pay him back
the thousand dollars he will release me.
I am mortified to allude to this, since you
have not done so. But what can I do?
I am in his power. If you can send the
money to me do so at once and let me
return it to him; for if he should inform
my father I shall have to confess all, and
I know not what will be my fate. You
see I write with frankness to you as one
in whom I trust my heart and happiness,
for I believe you truthful and noble, and
that you love me even as I love you. This
is a crisis when it would be weak and
foolish in me to disguise any thing I feel;
and I have not done so. Send the money,
if you can, or let me hear from you.
Bertha
.'My dear Father,
Forgive the step I have taken.
I could
NOT
become the wife of Mynheer
Van Vow.I write to assure you of my
safety
.
Your still affectionate
Bertha
.
